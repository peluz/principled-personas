"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs eaten for breakfast.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking.
4. The remainder will be the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market.
5. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning:
   \[
   16 - 3 = 13 \text{ eggs remaining}
   \]

3. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins:
   \[
   13 - 4 = 9 \text{ eggs remaining}
   \]

4. The remaining 9 eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

5. Janet sells each egg for $2:
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe. We know that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber.

First, let's calculate the amount of white fiber needed:
- The amount of blue fiber required is 2 bolts.
- The amount of white fiber required is half of the blue fiber, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

Next, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt
- Total bolts: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3.

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then invests an additional $50,000 in repairs. Therefore, the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The problem states that the repairs and subsequent investments increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the initial cost of the house ($80,000) and add it to the initial cost:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the initial cost of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the profit Josh made by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters run per sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters per sprint.

2. **Determine the total meters run per week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs, so the total meters run per week for one sprint is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Determine the total meters run per week for all sprints:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total meters run per week for all sprints is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. Therefore, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair up the glasses:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so the number of sheep in Charleston, \( C \), can be expressed as:
\[ C = 4S \]
Substituting the value of \( S \):
\[ C = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so the number of sheep in Toulouse, \( T \), can be expressed as:
\[ T = 2C \]
Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ T = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we sum the number of sheep in each city:
\[ T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Restart due to Windows updates:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Resuming the download from the beginning:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (since 80 GB have already been downloaded).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% of the download: 40 minutes
- Time for the restart: 20 minutes
- Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
120"
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
- Distance covered in the first segment: 180 miles.
- Distance covered in the third segment: 15 miles.
- Distance covered in the fourth segment: 120 miles.

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

The final numerical answer is:
315 miles"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second Month Downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third Month Downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 dozen donuts is:
     \[
     3 \times 68 = 204
     \]

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 dozen mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Therefore, the cost for 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     6 \times 55 = 330
     \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Thus, the total cost is:
\[
\boxed{694}
\]"
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this net profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90.

So, we set up the inequality:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5}\]
\[n \geq 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The number of students remaining after those enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + $125
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}

"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction.

1. The first day, the trains travel 80 miles westward.
2. The second day, the trains travel 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs used per week is:

Step 3: For 4 weeks, the number of eggs used is:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs used in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired = 3 hours
   - Time already spent = 2 hours
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time
   - Remaining distance = 6 miles
   - Remaining time = 1 hour
   - Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from both drinks:
- Total water before the spill = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \) liters.

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:
- Total volume after spill = \( 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \) liters.

The amount of water remains the same because only the volume of the drink changes, not the amount of water. Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
- Amount of water = \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Raymond's age when he had his son and then find out how many years ago that was.

1. Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:
   - Raymond had a son at the age of 23.

2. Determine Samantha's current age:
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.

3. Calculate the age difference between Raymond and Samantha:
   - Age difference = Samantha's age - Raymond's age
   - Age difference = 31 - 23 = 8 years

4. Since Raymond was 6 years younger than Samantha when they were born, we can confirm that the age difference remains consistent:
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so the age difference is indeed 6 years.

5. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born:
   - Raymond's son was born 6 years before Samantha was born.
   - Since Samantha is 31 years old now, Raymond's son was born 6 years ago.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 6 years ago.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to break down the sales by customer segment:

1. The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

Now, we sum the DVDs sold to all customers:
\[
3 \text{ DVDs} + 4 \text{ DVDs} + 0 \text{ DVDs} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

Thus, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is:
\[

"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns and then use the rate at which the candle melts.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total melting as follows:

\[
\text{Total melting} = \text{Rate of melting} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total melting} = 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm}
\]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of the 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of the 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered as \( x \). The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza boxes is:
\[ 8.50x \]

The total amount Marie paid is $50. Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 8.50:
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{243}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 365 days in a year, so in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to identify the distances of his stops and calculate the distance between them.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between his first and second stops. This distance is the difference between the mile at his second stop and the mile at his first stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which means it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the time spent per day:**
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per day is:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Determine the time spent per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sets of 4 yogurts in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Thus, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
\text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total cost of the video games John buys. He buys 8 video games at $20 each.

\[
\text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the money he has left to the cost of the video games.

\[
\text{Total money spent} = 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John made $195 from selling his lego sets and spent $165 on video games, we can confirm that the remaining money is indeed $5.

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Initially, he had 13 lego sets, and he sold all of them. Therefore, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 0
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine the time he spends running each day. According to the problem, he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \text{Time on the third day} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find his running speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time she spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance covered while running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance covered while walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance covered while walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age:**

   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find the difference.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume to meet your daily target of 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings you can consume is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can consume is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \]"

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the problem does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Let's denote the distance from his starting point to his destination as \(d\) miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from his starting point to his destination. Given that his speed is 10 miles per hour, the time \(t_1\) it takes to travel distance \(d\) is:
\[ t_1 = \frac{d}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After reaching his destination, Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \(t_2\) it takes to travel back the same distance \(d\) is:
\[ t_2 = \frac{d}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time \(T\) for the round trip is the sum of \(t_1\) and \(t_2\):
\[ T = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30:
\[ \frac{d}{10} = \frac{3d}{30} \]
\[ \frac{d}{6} = \frac{5d}{30} \]

So,
\[ T = \frac{3d}{30} + \frac{5d}{30} = \frac{8d}{30} = \frac{4d}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \(d\), the time it takes for Tom to get back is expressed in terms of \(d\):
\[ \boxed{\frac{4d}{15} \text{ hours}} \]"

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the day on which the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat has had and then sum them up.

1. **Patchy's Kittens:**
   - The problem states that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
   - The adopted kittens from the local animal shelter are 7.
   - Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kittens.

2. **Trixie's Kittens:**
   - The problem states that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Kittens:**
   - The total number of kittens is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie.
   - Adopted kittens: 7
   - Patchy's kittens: 21
   - Trixie's kittens: 12
   - Total: \( 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \)

Thus, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total."

"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for all the additional charges and fees applied to the original total.

1. **Original Total**: $40.00
2. **Delivery Fee**: $3.00
3. **Tip**: $4.00

First, we add the delivery fee and the tip to the original total:

\[
40.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 47.00
\]

Next, we need to account for the 25% delivery fee. The 25% fee is applied to the original total of $40.00:

\[
25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
\]

We add this 25% fee to the total amount after adding the delivery fee and tip:

\[
47.00 + 10.00 = 57.00
\]

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:

\[

"To determine the number of good oranges, we need to first understand the distribution of the oranges in the basket.

Given:
- Total number of oranges = 25
- One orange is bad
- 20% of the oranges are unripe
- 2 oranges are sour

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Next, we know there are 2 sour oranges. Now, let's sum up the number of unripe and sour oranges:
\[ \text{Total unripe and sour oranges} = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of unripe and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - 7 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of good oranges is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. This includes the cost of the material and the cost of the jeweler's construction.

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance.

Cost of insurance = 10% of Total cost before insurance
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid.

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
   - The total pension for the first 20 years is calculated as:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $50,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension after 30 years is the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the next 10 years:
     \[
     1,000,000 + 2,500 = 1,002,500
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be the value of the pension at the start of the 21st year, which is $2,500.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2500}
\]"
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment structure into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year.
   - The reduced monthly charge is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Adding the costs from both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate the total amount of gas in the tank when it is full and then use that to find out how many miles she can drive with that amount of gas.

Sophia has put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her 12-gallon tank. This means that the fraction of the tank that is filled is:

\[
\frac{4 \text{ gallons}}{12 \text{ gallons}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Since she has traveled 100 miles with this 4 gallons of gas, we can determine the miles per gallon (mpg) her car gets:

\[
\text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons, we multiply the total gallons in the tank by the miles per gallon:

\[
\text{Miles per full tank} = 12 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate the total amount of money she received from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end of the 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount of money she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. Therefore, the amount of money she started with is the total amount she has minus the total amount she received from her allowance:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from both weekdays and Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in one week (5 weekdays) is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from one weekday are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Since she teaches 5 weekdays, her total earnings from weekdays are:
\[ \$5625.00 \times 5 = \$28125.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Now, we add her earnings from weekdays and Saturday to find her total earnings for the week:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of the top level (level 4) as \( S_4 \), the level below it (level 3) as \( S_3 \), the level below that (level 2) as \( S_2 \), and the bottom level (level 1) as \( S_1 \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ S_4 = 16 \]

Since each level below has half the square footage of the level above it:
\[ S_3 = \frac{S_4}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]
\[ S_2 = \frac{S_3}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
\[ S_1 = \frac{S_2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 4 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 8 \)
- Level 4: \( S_4 = 16 \)

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{4} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, determine the number of days left in the first year after the first 180 days:
\[ 365 \text{ days/year} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, determine how many bags of dog food are needed. Since each bag contains 110 cups:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, and then find the difference between the two.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Laundry done by Raymond} - \text{Laundry done by David} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had initially and then add the stickers he received:

- Initial stickers: 10
- Stickers bought: 21
- Stickers received for birthday: 23

Total stickers before giving any away or using any:
\[ 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 \]

Next, we account for the stickers Charlie gave to his sister and the stickers he used to decorate a greeting card:

- Stickers given to his sister: 9
- Stickers used for greeting card: 28

Total stickers given away and used:
\[ 9 + 28 = 37 \]

Now, subtract the total number of stickers given away and used from the initial total:

\[ 54 - 37 = 17 \]

So, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

To find Alex's weight, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times \text{Grace's weight} - 2 = 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ \text{Grace's weight} + \text{Alex's weight} = 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is:
\[ \boxed{623} \]"
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \). According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has been on and then recognize that each vacation corresponds to one quilt block.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. The number of vacations he has taken is the difference between his current age and his age when he started vacationing, plus one (since he took his first vacation at age 23).

\[ \text{Number of vacations} = 34 - 23 + 1 = 12 \]

Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the number of vacations he has taken.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is:

\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of rings the alarm made the first time it went off as \( R_1 \), the second time as \( R_2 \), and the third time as \( R_3 \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( R_1 = 4 \)
- \( R_2 = 3 \times R_1 \)
- \( R_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times R_2 \)

First, we calculate \( R_2 \):
\[ R_2 = 3 \times R_1 = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate \( R_3 \):
\[ R_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times R_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of rings:
\[ \text{Total rings} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

6. **Salary Increase for the Third Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:

\[
\text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:

\[
\text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9
\]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad required for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets by summing the pets each person has:
\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( M \)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

Since we know James's age is 10, we can substitute \( M = 10 \) into the fourth equation:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now we know Corey's age is 11. Using the second piece of information, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine the original time for Gerald:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement:**
   A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald's new time is 90% of his original time. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C = 2D \) (since there are two cats for every dog).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

According to the problem, the number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ R = (D + C) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{348} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, James slept 6 hours. Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes was \( 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \).

2. **Convert the volume of tomatoes to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces, we divide 64 by 16:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars remaining on the motorway can be represented as:

\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 30 - x - 25 = 5 - x \]

Since the number of cars remaining on the motorway after the traffic jam is 0 (because all cars that did not exit have driven through the jam), we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 - x = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first sum up the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading after reading 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the number of pages he needs to read in the remaining 4 days is:

Pages to read in remaining days = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Pages to read in remaining days = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day over the next 4 days, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Finally, to find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its volume. After that, we will multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of the box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

The volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 such boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \(x\). Since each episode is 30 minutes, the total time he watched on Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which totals \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which totals \(2\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

Combining the known hours:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\]
So, the equation simplifies to:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[0.5x = 7 - 5.5\]
\[0.5x = 1.5\]
\[x = \frac{1.5}{0.5}\]
\[x = 3\]

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:
\[3\]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We are given that he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore. Since she rows at a speed of 1.25 feet per second, the time to row 64 seconds (which is 64 feet) is:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 feet} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{1.25 \text{ feet/second}} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we need to determine how much water the boat took on during this time. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water taken on per second can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Water per second} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 1.25 \text{ feet/second} = 0.25 \text{ liters/second} \]

Finally, the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reaches the shore is:

\[ \text{Total water} = 0.25 \text{ liters/second} \times 51.2 \text{ seconds} = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.8} \]"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per Teacher per Day**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Lessons per Day in Total**: Since there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons per day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) lessons.
4. **Cleanings per Lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Now, to find the total number of cleanings in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:

\[
\text{Total Cleanings} = \text{Total Lessons} \times \text{Cleanings per Lesson} = 8 \times 3 = 24
\]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers per day. Over 15 days, he would have planted:

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 50D \]

We already found that \( B = 300 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100 \]

For the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80 \]

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Next, we need to determine the selling price of the leftover lumber. Since the question does not specify the selling price, we will assume that Sasha sells the lumber at the same price she paid for it, which is $10 per 2 x 4 x 10 board and $16 per 4 x 4 x 10 board.

For the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100 \]

For the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
\[ 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80 \]

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is therefore \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts is sugar. Since sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the fraction of the total used for sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\).

We can now calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total amount of sugar and water by the fraction that represents the sugar:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 120 \times \frac{7}{20}
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
120 \times \frac{7}{20} = 120 \times 0.35 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, which means he buys a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is \(6 \times 60 = 360\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 360."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially imported is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary is given as $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sheets of paper used per week:**
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.
   - Therefore, the number of sheets used per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sheets of paper used per month:**
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the number of sheets used per month is:
     \[
     60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
     \]

Thus, the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:

"First, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought. 

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits brought by each person.

Morisette's total fruits:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits} \]

Kael's total fruits:
\[ 10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits} \]

Finally, we add the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael:
\[ 13 \text{ fruits} + 14 \text{ fruits} = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

Thus, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find out the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 7 \text{ (Friday)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

Let's add these values step by step:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]
\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \]
\[ 27 + 7 = 34 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, determine the remaining time after the first part:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance Rosie covers in the second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work. Let's break down the information given:

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

First, calculate how many letters Jennie stamps:
\[
\text{Letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means that 20 letters are now in the pile of already-stamped letters. We are also told that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie finishes stamping. This implies that the 20 letters she stamped are part of the 30 letters that were already stamped before she started.

Therefore, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\) dollars."
"To determine the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours).

Total patient hours per day:
\[ 500 \text{ patients/day} \times 0.4 \text{ hours/patient} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
\[ \text{Revenue} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30,000/\text{day} \]

Then, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
\[ \text{Cost} = 200 \text{ hours/day} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40,000/\text{day} \]

Finally, we determine the hospital's profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$30,000 - \$40,000 = -\$10,000/\text{day} \]

The hospital incurs a daily loss of $10,000. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
3. \( W + B + Q = 700 \) (the total number of bees is 700)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- From \( B = 2Q \), we get \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now, substituting \( W \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much money he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he spends playing video games in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, the total amount of money he would earn in one week if he worked those 14 hours is:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all items including the tax on nonfood items. Let's break it down step by step.

First, identify the items and their costs:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Next, calculate the total cost of the nonfood items (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps):
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Add the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs) to the total cost of the nonfood items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the nonfood items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies needed for each client:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of one bottle of bleach: $2
- Cost of one pack of cloths: $5
- Total cost per client: \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Total clients: 8
- Total cost per client: $9
- Total expenses: \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Total income: $92
- Total expenses: $72
- Profit: \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest per hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total number of hectares John has.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since John harvests every 3 months, there are 4 harvests in a year.

Next, we calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare in a year:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares John has:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:

"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each lego set and then sum them up.

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one. Therefore, the number of pieces in the second set is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set. Therefore, the number of pieces in the third set is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125
   \]

Now, we sum the pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Thus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned, so the net change is:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   After the next 6 hours, 60 bees leave, so the net change is:
   \[
   -15 - 60 = -75 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Therefore, at the end of the first 12 hours, there are 75 bees that left but have not yet returned.

5. **Bee population in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. Since 75 bees left, all 75 of them return in the last 6 hours.

Thus, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from school to their respective homes and then determine the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in their travel times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[ 250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid:

\[
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, which is \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \). So, the number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38
   \]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 38 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this purpose.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls in inches is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants in inches is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes in inches is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we sum up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of bananas by each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

First, let's calculate the monthly consumption:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we sum the monthly consumption:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to \(11 + 6 = 17\). After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2, resulting in \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

**Step 1: Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.**

On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth is 7 feet more than on Monday.

\[
\text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.

\[
\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months. 
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Let's denote the price after \( n \) increases as \( P_n \). The price after the first increase is:
   \[
   P_1 = 20 \times 1.20
   \]
   After the second increase:
   \[
   P_2 = P_1 \times 1.20 = 20 \times 1.20^2
   \]
   Continuing this pattern, after 18 increases:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 1.20^{18}
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Expression**: We need to calculate \( 1.20^{18} \):
   \[
   1.20^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to determine the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of a red car:**
   - We know that one red car costs $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of one red car is $4.

2. **Cost of an action figure:**
   - We are given that an action figure costs $5.

3. **Cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures would cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys:
- The value of the red cars: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The value of the action figures: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The value of the doll: $15.

Adding these values together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90. Therefore, the additional money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of the four birds and then sum them up. Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can sum up the ages of the four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

The total age of the four birds is:
\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.5 \times 1000 = 500 \]
\[ \text{Total payment per month} = 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

To find the total payment for a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will take to peel and cut all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the time taken for each task (peeling and cutting) and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time taken to peel is:
  \[
  60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time taken to cut is:
  \[
  60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- Converting 300 seconds to minutes:
  \[
  300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we sum the time taken for both tasks:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:

     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Profit per gallon is:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). Therefore,
\[ B = 40 \]

Next, we are told that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore,
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we are told that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore,
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together. We sum the crabs each person has:
\[ \text{Total} = R + M + B \]
Substituting the values of \( R \), \( M \), and \( B \):
\[ \text{Total} = 46 + 36 + 40 \]

Adding these values together:
\[ 46 + 36 = 82 \]
\[ 82 + 40 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. Given that the winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes and the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes. Since the total number of votes cast was 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 5w = 200 \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Jan's Age**: Jan is 30 years old.
2. **Mark's Age Two Years Ago**: Two years ago, Mark's age was \(M - 2\), where \(M\) is Mark's current age.
3. **Jean's Age Two Years Ago**: Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age two years ago was \(J - 2\), where \(J\) is Jean's current age.
4. **Relationship Between Mark and Jan Two Years Ago**: Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, \(M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2) + 5\).

First, let's solve for Mark's age two years ago:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(28) + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

So, Mark is currently 21 years old. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:
\[ J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time taken by the faster team:
- Each member of the faster team runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are four members in the team.

Total time for the faster team:
\[ 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time taken by the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 \text{ seconds} \]

Let's sum these times:
\[ 60 + 57 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 54 = 171 \]
\[ 171 + 51 = 222 \]

So, the total time for the slower team is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the Probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the ratio of the probabilities:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = 2
\]

### Step 4: Converting the Ratio to a Percentage
To express this ratio as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
2 \times 100\% = 200\%
\]

Thus, rolling a number greater than 3 is 200% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{200\%}
\]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find the number of pieces of straw given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{106} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

Therefore, the total cost for the trader is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at a rate of $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends. They spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, the amount spent on food is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on each of the 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of tickets and food to find the overall total cost:

\[ 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

Therefore, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and the rate at which he collects peaches per minute.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total weekly consumption of insects for the flock.
   - Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
   - There are 10 ducks in the flock.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption for the flock is \( 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \).

2. Calculate the daily consumption.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - To find the daily consumption, divide the total weekly consumption by 7.
   - So, the daily consumption is \( \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \).

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: We are considering 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees added over 10 years:
\[
8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
\]

Next, add the trees added over 10 years to the initial number of trees:
\[
50 \text{ trees} + 80 \text{ trees} = 130 \text{ trees}
\]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. Calculate the number of trees that die:
\[
0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
\]

Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees:
\[
130 \text{ trees} - 39 \text{ trees} = 91 \text{ trees}
\]

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the prank on Saturday morning:**
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

4. **On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the combined cost as follows:

\[ \text{Combined cost of a pencil and an eraser} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 = \$1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, the cost of one pen is $1.50.

To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up with her initial number of cards.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards collected over the three months:**
   \[
   60 + 40 + 200 = 200
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total collected over the three months:
   \[
   20 + 200 = 220
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{220}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which Publisher B pays Mark. Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, and Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays Mark \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents per sentence.

Next, we calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A. Since he edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A and earns 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Similarly, we calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B. Since he edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B and earns 10 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher B are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in a week in total, we add his earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

First, let's calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- Therefore, the total number of pails in a day is \(5 + 6 = 11\) pails.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. So, the total volume of water Baldur gets in a day is:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is \(\boxed{55}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in his weekly salary.

First, let's calculate the 5% raise in his weekly salary:
\[ \text{Weekly Salary Increase} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]
So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money he makes in a year from his new weekly salary:
\[ \text{Total Weekly Salary for the Year} = 2100 \times 52 = 1092000 \]

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total amount he made from his new weekly salary:
\[ \text{Total Yearly Earnings} = 1092000 + 5000 = 1097000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1097000 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of grapes produced by Josie's farm per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and she has 10 acres, the total production of grapes is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total production of wine barrels is:

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year by Josie's farm is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = \(5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = \(3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for all the meals:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

Given that the desired average is 93 and there are six tests, we can set up the equation:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Solving for the sum of all six scores:
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. **Tuesday**: She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).
3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts to understand the relationships and calculations involved.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups means there are \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - The total cost of 240 cups is $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{145}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking around the park."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an inconsistency in the setup or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation:

Given \( B = 4S \) and \( B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \), we substitute \( B = 4S \) into the second equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus an additional 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she will have paid after 12 months. This is $1980. Therefore, her remaining balance will be:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, the number of dahlias is 4 + 7 = 11. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is the sum of the roses and the dahlias, which is 4 + 11 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age = 21 years
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, determine their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Finally, calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Adrian's age in three years} + \text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points scored by all four students to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Let Jojo's score be \( J \). The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]
6. Solve for \( J \):

"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- The cost per hour for the canoe is $30.
- Carlos rents the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Carlos is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- The cost per hour for the banana boat raft is $18.
- Benji rents the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Benji is \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the days.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew plans to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - Andrew plans to travel by car from Rochester back to New Jersey.
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Since it takes 6 days by bus, it will take \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days by car.

3. **Total Travel Days:**
   - Andrew will travel by bus for 6 days.
   - Andrew will travel by car for 3 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days he will travel is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) days.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

After buying 14 new grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his burrito and then subtract the value of his gift card.

First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 sauces cost $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To determine how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces per minute and then convert that into hours.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add per minute together.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Together, they can add:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Thus, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the first batch home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate the number of watermelons that were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means that the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we need to calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark also needs to pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{276000}

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave. We know that one-third of the 36 penguins jump into the ocean and another one-third go into the cave.

First, calculate one-third of 36:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean and 12 penguins go into the cave. The total number of penguins that leave the snow to either swim or go to the cave is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]
Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing in the snow is:
\[
36 - 24 = 12

"First, let's determine how much Steve eats per day. According to the problem, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. The problem states that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he eats in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce in a week:
\[ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to produce the tomatoes he eats in a week.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. This means that for every five empty pens, he gets one new full pen.

Ram starts with 25 pens. He will use these 25 pens to make new pens until he runs out of empty pens to mix. Let's break down the process:

1. **First Round:**
   - Ram uses 25 pens to make new pens.
   - Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.
   - After making these 5 new pens, he will have \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) empty pens left.

2. **Second Round:**
   - Ram now has 20 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) new pens.
   - After making these 4 new pens, he will have \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) empty pens left.

3. **Third Round:**
   - Ram now has 16 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{16}{5} = 3 \) new pens (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 3 new pens).
   - After making these 3 new pens, he will have \( 16 - 3 = 13 \) empty pens left.

4. **Fourth Round:**
   - Ram now has 13 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{13}{5} = 2 \) new pens (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 2 new pens).
   - After making these 2 new pens, he will have \( 13 - 2 = 11 \) empty pens left.

5. **Fifth Round:**
   - Ram now has 11 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{11}{5} = 2 \) new pens (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 2 new pens).
   - After making these 2 new pens, he will have \( 11 - 2 = 9 \) empty pens left.

6. **Sixth Round:**
   - Ram now has 9 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{9}{5} = 1 \) new pen (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 1 new pen).
   - After making this 1 new pen, he will have \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) empty pens left.

7. **Seventh Round:**
   - Ram now has 8 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{8}{5} = 1 \) new pen (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 1 new pen).
   - After making this 1 new pen, he will have \( 8 - 1 = 7 \) empty pens left.

8. **Eighth Round:**
   - Ram now has 7 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{7}{5} = 1 \) new pen (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 1 new pen).
   - After making this 1 new pen, he will have \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) empty pens left.

9. **Ninth Round:**
   - Ram now has 6 empty pens.
   - He can make \( \frac{6}{5} = 1 \) new pen (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 1 new pen).
   - After making this 1 new pen, he will have \( 6 - 1 = 5 \) empty pens left.

10. **Tenth Round:**
    - Ram now has 5 empty pens.
    - He can make \( \frac{5}{5} = 1 \) new pen (since he can only use 5 pens to make one new pen, he can only make 1 new pen).
    - After making this 1 new pen, he will have \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) empty pens left.

11. **Eleventh Round:**
    - Ram now has 4 empty pens.
    - He can make \( \frac{4}{5} = 0 \) new pens (since he needs 5 pens to make one new pen, he can't make any new pens with 4 pens).
    - After making 0 new pens, he will have 4 empty pens left.

At this point, Ram has 4 empty pens left, which is not enough to make another full pen. Therefore, the total number of pens he gets is the initial 25 pens plus the 10 new pens he made:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram has is:

\[
\boxed{35}

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine the ages of each individual based on the information provided.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
\text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of students**: 1000.

2. **Students exiting through exit A**: 30% of 1000.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

3. **Remaining students after exit A**: 
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

4. **Students exiting through exit B**: \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students exited through exit B.

5. **Students exiting through exit C**: The rest of the students.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

First, let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ J = 2R \]
where \( J \) is the number of candies John has. We are given that John has 54 candies:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, we can write:
\[ J = R + 6 \]
Since we already determined \( R = 27 \), we substitute this value in:
\[ J = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies.

Now, we need to find how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = J - J_{\text{James}} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has two books.
2. Pandora has one book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own two books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's one book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own one book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's two books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.

Thus, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total allowance.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used:
- Jason uses 15 minutes per day for his calls with his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes for calls with other people.

Therefore, the total minutes used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes allowed:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, after all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2f \) (since there are \( f \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on her makeup over the course of the movie.

She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. Therefore, the number of hours she spends on makeup each week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she spends on makeup over the entire duration of the movie is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Jean pays:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27000} \]"

\[ 12 + 43 = 55 \]
\[ 55 + 15 = 70 \]
\[ 70 + 4 = 74 \]
\[ 74 + 22 = 96 \]

So, the total amount spent is $96.

Isabelle split this total cost evenly among her three parents. Therefore, we need to divide the total cost by 3:

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. Given that a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Her sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Her sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Total cookies eaten by her sister:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Total calories consumed by Sue:
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Total calories consumed by her sister:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Additionally, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

5. **Summing Up:**
   - Total animals killed: \( 46 \text{ (wolves)} + 27 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \)

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he now has is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Therefore, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = \( 100 \times 0.01 = \$1.00 \).

2. **Nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = \( 40 \times 0.05 = \$2.00 \).

3. **Dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 20 \times 0.10 = \$2.00 \).

4. **Dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills = \( 40 \times 1.00 = \$40.00 \).

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{\text{Total length of the tree}}{\text{Length of each section}}\right) \times \text{Weight per section}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the fact that termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. This means that 70% of the original weight remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} \times (1 - \text{Percentage eaten})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ A_a = 52 \]

From this, we can solve for \( J_a \):

\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples. The problem also states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

So, Jamal has 48 bananas. Now, we need to find out how many fruits Andrea has. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, and the same number of apples as Jamal. Therefore, Andrea has:

\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Andrea has 52 apples, as given. So, the total number of fruits Andrea has is:

\[ A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ 76 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla plans to make 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = 6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
62

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. According to the problem, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} + 5 \]

Substituting the number of trees Ferdinand has into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference in the number of trees} = \text{Number of trees Harry has} - \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money that all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house that Mrs. Cruz needs to pay, which includes the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

1. **Selling Price**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

Next, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

\[
\text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]
\[
\text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
\]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[
\boxed{9500}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

Next, we add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.

So, the total number of windows in one house is:
\[6 \text{ windows (from bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}\]

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the number of lines in the first scene is:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Sean has a third of these lines to memorize:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the number of lines in the second scene is:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of these lines to memorize:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
   \]

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   Now, we sum the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene:

"First, let's determine the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

Next, we find the number of cards remaining after removing those with the letter A:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48
\]

Now, we calculate the number of cards that had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[
\text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

We then find the number of cards remaining after removing those with the letter B:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24
\]

Next, we calculate the number of cards that had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[
\text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]

Finally, we find the number of cards remaining after removing those with the letter C:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9
\]

These remaining cards had the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( C \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, so we can write the equation:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know from the initial condition that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. The total cost for the popsicles is:

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. The total cost for the ice cream bars is:

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. According to the problem, a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[ \text{Spots of a mamba} = \frac{\text{Spots of a cobra}}{2} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots of cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots of mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Total spots} = \text{Total spots of cobras} + \text{Total spots of mambas} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be attending the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract that from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads. Finally, we will divide this length by the length of each sterling silver bead to find the number of beads.

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
     \[
     8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - The length occupied by the sterling silver beads is 17 inches.
   - Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is:
     \[
     \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
     \]

Thus, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we sum up the totals for all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Thus, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
\]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[
\text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21
\]

Thus, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[
21
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. The flag has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. We can calculate the total number of stars in these rows as follows:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

This means that 36 stars are accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars. To find the number of stars that are in the rows of 5 stars, we subtract the number of stars in the other rows from the total number of stars:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Now, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars are there. Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as \( A \) and the number of medals Izzy has as \( I \). According to the problem, Ali has 22 medals, so \( A = 22 \). Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so \( I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \).

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is \( A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \). The problem states that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out, which means the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 10 \times (A + I) = 10 \times 39 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is \( 390 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Susan earns in 150 minutes. She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, the total amount she earns is:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the fourth round: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the fourth round: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the fourth round: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}

"To find the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
\[ 100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220 \]

**Total Squats:**
\[ 50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90 \]

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
\[ 20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \]

Finally, we sum up the totals for all activities:
\[ 220 \text{ (pushups)} + 90 \text{ (squats)} + 60 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 370 \]

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the household and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each day they consume:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Monday: Closed
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Friday: Closed
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold on the days he was open:
\[ 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} + 20 \text{ (Saturday)} + 20 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was 35 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - The opening bid is $200.
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350.

Carmen wins the auction after her fourth bid. Therefore, the total amount she paid is the sum of her bids:

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total cost of the miles driven and the total bonus given to the driver over the year.

First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day.
- Therefore, the total distance driven each day is \(30 + 30 = 60\) miles.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.
- So, the total distance driven in a year is \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost per mile is $2.
- Therefore, the total cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver in a year:
- The driver receives a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the total bonus given in a year is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Finally, let's find the total amount John pays in a year:
- The total cost for the miles driven is $30,000.
- The total bonus given is $1,800.
- Therefore, the total amount John pays in a year is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print one side of a page. Therefore, each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

2. **Page Arrangement**: In the given arrangement, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. This means that the first and last pages (1 and 32) are printed on the back of the paper, and the remaining pages (2 to 31) are printed on the front of the paper.

3. **Counting the Pieces of Paper**: Since each piece of paper is used to print two pages, and there are 32 pages in total, we need 16 pieces of paper (because \(32 \div 2 = 16\)).

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\text{Amount spent on food and snacks} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we add the $10 she spent on rides to the $25 spent on food and snacks:

\[
\text{Total spent} = 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she brought:

\[
\text{Amount left} = 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books, so the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
3. The number of books sold this year is 45.
4. The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold this year, so it is \(2 \times 45 = 90\).
5. The total number of books sold in the first two years is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
6. The total number of books sold in the three years is 200, so the number of books sold in the third year is \(200 - 135 = 65\).

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is the number of books sold in the second year multiplied by the price per book. Since the number of books sold in the second year is 90, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \(90 \times 20 = 1800\).

The final numerical answer is:
1800"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, we add this bonus to his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns weekly, we consider only full weeks in April. Therefore, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we add the bonus for the 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 4 \times 300 \, \text{\$} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Watson made \(\boxed{4400}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he competed against.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beat 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he competed against:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of loaves sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, we need to find half of the remaining 20 loaves:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight Sandy needs to lose in 4 weeks is 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weight loss per week}} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Thus, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, we can calculate the number of three-day intervals by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, we can calculate the number of five-day intervals by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on his trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the amount he can spend on the trip:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2050 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
- There are 5 people in the family.
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Now, add the daily egg consumption of both groups to find the total daily egg consumption:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Next, to find the total egg consumption for a week (7 days), multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn's age = 30 years
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"Let's denote the current age of Noah as \( N \) and the current population of Chile as \( P \).

From the problem, we know that six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 20 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah's current age \( N \) is:
\[ N = 20 + 6 = 26 \]

Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now, so we can write:
\[ \frac{P}{2} = 3000 \times 20 \]
This is because six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, which was 20. Therefore:
\[ \frac{P}{2} = 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to find the current population \( P \):
\[ P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

Thus, the population of Chile now is:
\[ \boxed{120000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[14\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store's existing marbles.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 30 \).

The number of girls in the classroom is 3 times the number of boys, so the number of girls \( G \) is:
\[ G = 3 \times B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The number of nongendered children \( N \) is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the number of boys, so:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

The total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 123 \]"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people remaining at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who stayed at the party is 8. Since the total number of women initially was 15, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The problem states that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the cost of the pen is $1. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has and then find out how many boxes are needed to store all of them, given that each box can hold a certain number of pencils. We also need to consider the pencils that Meg has.

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 3x = 24 \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Adding the 46 pencils that Meg has, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, assuming each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of both the cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[
\frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[
5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters weaker per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
\]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee; it simply adds more liquid. Therefore, the addition of 15 milliliters of cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters.

Thus, the total reduction in the strength of the coffee is solely due to the cooling process. Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is:

\[
60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we can use the given ratio of trading old records for new ones. According to the problem, 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of old records brought in:

\[ \text{Number of new records} = \frac{\text{Number of old records brought in}}{2} \]

We know the number of new records is 7, so we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 7 = \frac{\text{Number of old records brought in}}{2} \]

To find the number of old records brought in, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Number of old records brought in} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Thus, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know the monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so the monthly salary for each senior programmer is:
\[
\text{Monthly salary for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salaries for junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100% and then calculate the time required based on the given charging rate.

The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charged. Therefore, it needs to be charged by an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}\):

\[ \text{Time required in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[ \text{Rewards} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer spent $43 on their current shopping trip. They can use the $4 in rewards to reduce the price. The new price after applying the rewards is:
\[ \text{New Price} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon will take off:
\[ \text{Coupon Discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The final price after applying the coupon is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick should choose, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

### Job A:
1. **Gross Pay**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **State Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

### Job B:
1. **Gross Pay**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Pay Before Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Net Pay After Property Tax**: 90% of $36,000 (since 10% is the tax rate on net income after property tax) = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A: $24,000
- Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job.

"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ruined castles:**
   - There are 220 castles in total.
   - 40 percent of them are ruins.
   - To find 40 percent of 220, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:**
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - To find half of 88, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 88 \times 0.5 = 44
     \]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for the installments is:

"To determine how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to find the total number of guns. We can do this by summing the number of guns each person has:

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, the total number of guns is 24. If these 24 guns are to be shared equally among the four people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ), we divide the total number of guns by 4:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they shared them equally. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Finally, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is 310 ounces."
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow the changes in the stock price step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after First Year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

3. **Second Year Decrease:**
   The stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after Second Year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72
   \]

Thus, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[ \text{Hot dogs eaten by Thomas} = 3 \times \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate:

\[ \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Hot dogs eaten by Thomas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We do this by subtracting the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} - \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, so we have the equation:

\[ C + H = 60 \]

It is also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we have:

\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. Therefore, the total number of balls he would have at the end of the fourth week is \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. Out of the 7 balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 is lost. So, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is \(7 - 3 + 2 = 6\).

Thus, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling with on stage is 6."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of the other animals based on the given information and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

1. **Weight of the pink frog:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of pink frog} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the blue beetle:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:
   \[
   \text{Weight of blue beetle} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad:
   \[
   \text{Weight of green toad} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   \[
   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird:**
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird:
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Next, we calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of pink frog} + \text{Weight of blue beetle} + \text{Weight of green toad} + \text{Weight of yellow snake} + \text{Weight of red bird} + \text{Weight of container}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
\]

Adding these weights together:
\[
50 + 50 = 100
\]
\[
100 + 50 = 150
\]
\[
150 + 60 = 210
\]
\[
210 + 30 = 240
\]
\[
240 + 20 = 260

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June after following his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the new daily distance Tyson runs.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days in June).
4. Provide the final numerical answer.

First, let's find the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson should run is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days):

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 (cost of Juice Box C) - $9 (cost of Juice Box B) = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more expensive than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week. She buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies in a week is:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box. She puts 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box in a week is:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. Therefore, the total number of cookies her husband eats in a week is:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the number of cookies her son and her husband eat from the total number of cookies in a week. The total number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband is:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:

"To determine the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory makes per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue.
4. Calculate the percentage increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.**

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was sold for $100.
\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.**

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day, and each silo is sold for $220.
\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue.**

\[ \text{Difference in daily revenue} = \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**

The percentage increase is calculated by dividing the difference in daily revenue by the original daily revenue from tractors, and then multiplying by 100.
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10\% \]"
"To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is:
  \[
  25 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 100 \text{ dollars/month}
  \]
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:
\[
100 \text{ dollars/month (food)} + 20 \text{ dollars/month (treats)} + 100 \text{ dollars/month (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars/month}

"To find the total number of hours Peyton will spend on her after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class on Monday. Therefore, the cooking class lasts \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class on Tuesday. Therefore, the museum tour lasts \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, we sum up the durations of all the activities:
\[ 1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Peyton will spend on her after-work activities is:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on all activities. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Given that the shortest tree is 6 feet tall and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, we can calculate the height of the second tree as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the activities:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for the go-karts is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- She also wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.

Adding these costs together:
\[
5 \text{ (mini-golf)} + 20 \text{ (go-karts)} + 5 \text{ (arcade tokens)} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After accounting for the $30 spent on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[
90 - 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the remaining $60 can be used to buy snacks, drinks, or other party supplies, we need to determine how many friends she can invite. Assuming each friend gets $10 (the cost of one go-kart ride), the number of friends she can invite is:
\[
\frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

Therefore, Morgan can invite 6 friends to her birthday party.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost of the lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   - Billy has $10.
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
   - The total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the change Billy receives after buying the candy:**
   - The change Billy receives is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

3. **Determine how much money Billy spends on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs.
   - The amount of money spent on gumballs is \( \frac{1}{2} (10 - 1.5x) \).

4. **Calculate the cost of the gumballs:**
   - The cost of each gumball is $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - The total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

5. **Set up the equation based on the amount spent on gumballs:**
   - The amount spent on gumballs is equal to the half of the change:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} (10 - 1.5x) = 2
     \]

6. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     10 - 1.5x = 4
     \]
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     -1.5x = 4 - 10
     \]
     \[
     -1.5x = -6
     \]
   - Divide both sides by -1.5:
     \[
     x = \frac{-6}{-1.5} = 4
     \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \). According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, so \( C = 45 \). The problem also states that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:

\[ C = 2S - 5 \]

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third segments. The combined distance of the second and third segments is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third city and back to the first city) is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Converting this to a more familiar unit, \(\frac{1}{20}\) days is equivalent to 6 hours (since 1 day = 24 hours, and \(\frac{1}{20} \times 24 = 1.2\) hours).

Therefore, the train goes between services every 6 hours. However, the question asks for the number of days, so the final numerical answer is:
\[6\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. Given:
- A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds}}{2} = \frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the specified number of beds:
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds. Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 \text{ pounds} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

- Mark needs to make 3 collie beds. Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we sum the total stuffing required for both types of beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 and 3 to fractions with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of fourth-graders at Small Tree School:**
   \[
   96
   \]

2. **Number of girls at Small Tree School:**
   \[
   43
   \]

3. **Number of boys at Small Tree School:**
   Since the total number of fourth-graders is the sum of the number of girls and boys, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
   \]

4. **Number of girls absent on Friday:**
   \[
   5
   \]

5. **Number of boys absent on Friday:**
   \[
   4
   \]

6. **Number of girls present on Friday:**
   \[
   43 - 5 = 38
   \]

7. **Number of boys present on Friday:**
   \[
   53 - 4 = 49
   \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[
\boxed{49}

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points required is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given by the expression \( 4x - 5 \). Substituting \( x = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21. \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the current points Erin has and then work backwards.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the current points Erin has:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points after reaching her current points. Therefore, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, we subtract the 14 points from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment purchased and then calculate the number of faulty pieces and the number of functioning pieces. Finally, we will calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of equipment:**
   Let the total number of pieces of equipment be \( N \).

2. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces:**
   Since 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, the number of faulty pieces is:
   \[
   0.4N
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of functioning pieces:**
   The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:
   \[
   N - 0.4N = 0.6N
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:**
   The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the functioning pieces are the same as the total number of pieces, the cost of the functioning pieces is:
   \[

1. **Calculate the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday.
   - She sold these apples at $4 per piece.
   - She earned $56 from selling these apples.
   - Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total earnings on Monday}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since the loan period is five months, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for five months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10}{12} \times 5\% = \frac{50}{12}\% = \frac{25}{6}\% \approx 4.17\%
   \]
   The interest on $3,650 for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{25}{600} = 3650 \times \frac{25}{600} = 3650 \times \frac{5}{120} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{3650}{24} \approx 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.416
   \]
   Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = 760.42

"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue if she sells all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies. Therefore, her total cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all the lemonade, so the profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. We know that she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Since each cup is sold for $1, the revenue per hour is:

\[ 4 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$4/\text{hour} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Since the total profit is $18 and she sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours the lemonade stand is open is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{\$4/\text{hour}} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

However, the question asks for the profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand, which is the total profit divided by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = \$4.5/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit per hour that Millie makes is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he retained \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land. The remaining land is given as 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:

\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply \(\frac{64}{5}\) by \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
L = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of one pencil is $3, so the cost of 8 pencils is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Adding the cost of the erasers and the pencils together gives:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."

Since Ms. Thompson receives 66 messages, we can calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides. Therefore, the cost per ride for David is:

\[
\text{Cost per ride for David} = \frac{\$30}{9 \text{ rides}} = \frac{30}{9} \approx \$3.33 \text{ per ride}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is:

\[
\text{Cost per ride for Dasha} = 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride}
\]

Since they both need to ride 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:

\[
\text{Total cost for Dasha} = 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4/\text{ride} = \$36
\]

The total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet, is:

\[
\text{Total cost for David} = \$30
\]

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the total cost for David from the total cost for Dasha:

\[
\text{Money saved by David} = \$36 - \$30 = \$6
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can determine the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% savings:

- Normally, Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Normally, Disney Plus costs $10 a month.
- With a 20% savings, the cost of Hulu becomes \(10 \times (1 - 0.20) = 10 \times 0.80 = 8\) dollars a month.
- With a 20% savings, the cost of Disney Plus becomes \(10 \times (1 - 0.20) = 10 \times 0.80 = 8\) dollars a month.

So, the total cost for Hulu and Disney Plus together is:
\[8 + 8 = 16\] dollars a month.

Next, we add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
\[16 + 10 = 26\] dollars a month for the streaming services.

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 a month:
\[60 - 26 = 34\] dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's convert all the time spent on each activity into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Then calculate the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}
\]"
"To determine the number of books Wendy needs to place in the shelving system, we first need to calculate the total number of slots available in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of slots is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books Wendy wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, this number is 20 more than double the number of slots, which can be expressed as:

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

Now, we calculate the value of \( x \):

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before any are passed out or received is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards that were passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find the net change in the number of cards Erica has, we subtract the cards passed out and add the cards received:
\[ 50 - 24 + 17 \]

Let's perform the arithmetic step-by-step:
\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]
\[ 26 + 17 = 43 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is:
\[ \boxed{43} \]"
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pizza originally had 12 slices, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to save and then determine how many days it will take him to earn that amount.

Mark needs $300 to buy the bike. He already has $50 in his bank account. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to save is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to work to earn $250, we divide the amount he needs to save by his daily earnings:
\[ \frac{250}{10} = 25 \]

Therefore, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: The number of millipedes is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number of spiders. Therefore, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Therefore, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of bug to find the total number of bugs:
\[
90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168
\]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:
\[

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has the following zebras:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stripes:
\[
2 \times 17 + 36 + 18
\]

First, calculate \( 2 \times 17 \):
\[
2 \times 17 = 34
\]

Next, add the stripes of the other zebras:
\[
34 + 36 + 18
\]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Corn to cannolis ratio:**
   There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, if the number of cannolis is \( C \), the number of corns \( K \) is \( 2C \).

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   Given \( C = 40 \), the initial number of corns \( K \) is:
   \[
   K = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis. Therefore, the new number of cannolis \( C_{\text{new}} \) is:
   \[
   C_{\text{new}} = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

5. **Corn after buying fewer:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since the new number of cannolis is 100, the new number of corns \( K_{\text{new}} \) is:
   \[
   K_{\text{new}} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

6. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   \text{Total} = C_{\text{new}} + K_{\text{new}} = 100 + 60 = 160

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given and set up an equation.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps so far. Additionally, he took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Let's denote the number of steps he took during his jog as \( x \).

According to the problem, after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that the total number of steps he has taken so far (including the jog) is:
\[ 5,000 + 1,000 + x = 10,000 - 2,000 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 5,000 + 1,000 + x = 8,000 \]

Combining the constants on the left side:
\[ 6,000 + x = 8,000 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6,000 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 8,000 - 6,000 \]
\[ x = 2,000 \]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page contains 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time required to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes. He needs to get to the airport in 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time Toby needs to be at the airport is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 10 \text{ minutes (travel)} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes, the time he will be at the airport is 40 minutes. The difference between the planned departure time and the time he will be at the airport is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 3 - 1.50 = 1.50).

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. According to the deal, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 seashells. Therefore, the total cost for the seashells is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets. Therefore, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 + 6.00 + 1.00 = 11.50 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $11.50, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ 10 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

Since Sally does not have enough money to cover the total cost of the items, she is short by $1.50. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-1.50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make to last her for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies per night. Therefore, in 30 days, she will eat:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are equivalent to 60 cookies. We do this by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, we can calculate the number of dangerous candles as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, the number of dangerous candles that also smell like wet dog is:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 2,500 \times 0.05 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 125 \]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[
0.30 \times 20 = 6
\]
So, the discount amount per blouse is $6.

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[
20 - 6 = 14
\]
Each blouse is now priced at $14 after the discount.

Misha picks out 4 blouses. To find the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses, we multiply the sale price of one blouse by 4:
\[
14 \times 4 = 56
\]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and the total number of humps:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):

\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2C + D - C - D = 124
\]

\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[
124 + D = 180
\]

Subtract 124 from both sides:

\[
D = 180 - 124
\]

\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 800 km.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- Distance for the first 4 days: 800 km.
- Distance for the next 2 days: 240 km.
- Distance for the next day: 0 km.
- Distance for the second week: 2100 km.

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Elevation difference} = \text{Elevation of Stanley's comb} - \text{Elevation of Oliver} \]
\[ \text{Elevation difference} = 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Elevation difference} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left is:

\[50 - 20 = 30\]

Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is:

\[\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\]

So, the number of cats left on the rock after 18 cats ran away is:

\[30 - 18 = 12\]

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16):**
   - The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

4. **Remaining 4 months (months 17 to 20):**
   - The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 4 months = 4 months * $14/month = $56.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $112 (next 8 months) + $56 (remaining 4 months) = $236.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $236."
"Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

Substituting the value of \( T \):
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \] dollars.

The total cost of both jeans is:
\[ T + J = 28 + 22 = 50 \] dollars.

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Therefore:
\[ S = 6 \] dollars.

The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}S = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \] dollars.

The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ S - \frac{1}{3}S = 6 - 2 = 4 \] dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know that the jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \] dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. So, she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
2. Each of the store-bought bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day.
3. Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day.

- The 3 store-bought bird feeders will attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.
- The 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself will attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards because he keeps \( \frac{1}{3}x \) cards. He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash. This means the total amount of money he got from selling the cards is $50 + $100 (the cost of the ticket) = $150.

So, we can set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hot dogs the caterer prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hot dogs prepared for the initial 36 guests. According to the problem, half of the guests would eat two hotdogs each. Half of 36 guests is:

\[
\frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests}
\]

Each of these 18 guests would eat 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hot dogs prepared for these 18 guests is:

\[
18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

Next, we need to account for the additional 40 guests who showed up. Since each of these 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, the total number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[
40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

Adding the hot dogs prepared for the initial 36 guests to the additional hot dogs needed for the 40 guests, the total number of hot dogs prepared is:

\[
36 + 40 = 76 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog. Initially, 36 guests were expected, and 40 guests actually showed up. The total number of guests is 40. The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, which is the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog from the 40 guests. Since 36 guests were initially expected and 40 guests showed up, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 36 = 4 \text{ guests}
\]

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending, this means he spent 99% of his money. If he spent 99% of $5, then the amount he spent is:
\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money George spent on chips. We know he bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount he spent:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can determine the number of candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven being on for 3 hours. Since the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, the total increase in temperature is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after 3 hours of baking is:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the temperature decrease due to the window being open for 30 minutes. The window causes a cooling of 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the total cooling is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature of the house after the window is opened for 30 minutes is:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to complete the triathlon, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting up the equation for James's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 32 MPH
- Time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

So, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much hay the horse eats. Michael's horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

The cost of one bail of hay is $3. Therefore, the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael will have after buying the hay is:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Thus, the number of glasses that can be made is:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

\[ \text{Joey's new score} = 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

\[ \text{Marcy's new score} = 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score to determine by how many points Joey is now winning:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Joey's new score} - \text{Marcy's new score} = 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

The remaining sneakers sold to the department store were:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, we can find the total revenue by adding the revenue from both sales:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the two different types of packets separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each contain eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces per packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces per packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

Given:
- The cost of a movie ticket with the super ticket is $20.
- The cost of a movie ticket plus popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $12 + \( P + 3 \).
- You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

The equation representing the savings is:
\[ 20 - (12 + P + 3) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 20 - 12 - P - 3 = 2 \]
\[ 5 - P = 2 \]
\[ -P = 2 - 5 \]
\[ -P = -3 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the original cost per balloon.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.**

The cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To find the product:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]
\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]
\[
170 \times 65 = 10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is given by:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is given by:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, we sum the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

Thus, the car's average speed during the trip is \(\boxed{50}\) mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna initially has. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, and each sapphire is worth $800. Therefore, the total value of the sapphires is:

\[ 8 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$6400 \]

Next, Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Since she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the value of the 2 rubies she receives is also $2400. Now, let's calculate the value of the rubies she receives. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

After the trade, Jenna no longer has the 3 sapphires she traded away. Therefore, the number of sapphires she has left is:

\[ 8 \text{ sapphires} - 3 \text{ sapphires} = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

The total value of the sapphires she has left is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Now, we can calculate the total value of all her jewels (sapphires and rubies) after the trade. The total value is the sum of the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received:

\[ \$4000 \text{ (sapphires)} + \$2400 \text{ (rubies)} = \$6400 \]

Thus, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then sum these amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for his raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions:
- Width: 2 feet
- Length: 8 feet
- Height: 2 feet

The volume \( V \) of one raised bed can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the given dimensions:
\[
V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) of soil needed is:
\[
V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) of the potting soil is:
\[
C = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[
\boxed{1920}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of green and yellow cards and then sum them up with the red cards.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - Calculate 60% of 15:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Add this to the number of red cards to find the number of green cards:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 24 green cards.

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   - Calculate the sum of red and green cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 39 yellow cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78
     \]

Thus, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were already there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.
3. So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there. The total number of fairies now is \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies that have spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, we perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35\% \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract these from the total number of cards to find the number of cards she gives to her students:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If her students each receive 10 cards, we can determine the number of students by dividing the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives:

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to first calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since each room has 2 sheets, the number of pillow cases is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since each room has 4 pillow cases, the number of towels is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry item per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry is:

"To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes she can make with all her sprinkles.

Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate with all her sprinkles is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find the number of pans required, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ cupcakes}}{12 \text{ cupcakes/pan}} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Thus, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The cost of the pen is $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Therefore, the cost of the piece of paper is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 3 \times \text{Cost of the pen} - 1 = 3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
\]

So, the piece of paper costs $5.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the pen} + \text{Cost of the piece of paper} = 2 + 5 = 7
\]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
2. Determine the number of pencils used after two months.
3. Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
4. Determine the number of pencils used at the end of the year.
5. Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils, so the total number of pencils at the start of the year is:
   \[
   30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. After two months, \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
   \[
   300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}
   \]

3. At the end of the year, only \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils}
   \]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \). We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. To verify, if Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he can have \( \frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \) cookies, which matches the problem statement.

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

\[
\frac{1}{4} x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total number of minutes he needs to walk by the total number of days he will walk.

First, we know that three weeks is equivalent to 21 days (since 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the new shoes. He plans to walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the total number of days:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} \approx 11.43 \]

So, Jason has to spend approximately 11.43 minutes walking each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11.43 \]"
"To determine how many books each child received, we first need to find out the total number of books Sarah bought. Given that each book costs $15 and she spent a total of $300, we can calculate the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child received, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Thus, each child received 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Then, we can subtract this number from the total number of kids to find out how many aren't allergic to anything.

First, let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and tour guides combined.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

\[
\text{Total number of employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

\[
\text{Total number of tour guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of employees} + \text{Total number of tour guides} = 600 + 21 = 621

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since Tom and his wife are both going, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. To find the increased price per day, we calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
So, the hotel costs $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}

Their goal is $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the total amount they have already earned from their goal:
\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri currently has on his player. According to the problem, Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Gabriel has 20 songs, so:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can still add to their player. Each player can store up to 100 songs. Therefore, the number of additional songs Gabriel can add is:

\[ \text{Additional songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Similarly, the number of additional songs Luri can add is:

\[ \text{Additional songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after applying the discount and the coupon, and then determine the cost per razor.

First, let's determine the cost of the razors before any discounts or coupons:
- Each pack contains 4 razors.
- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs.

Total cost for 2 packs before any discounts or coupons:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" promotion:
- For every pack bought, one pack is free.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets 2 packs for free.
- Therefore, she only pays for 2 packs.

Since the cost for 2 packs is $8.00, the cost remains $8.00 after the promotion.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon:
\[ \$8.00 - \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Heather buys 2 packs, which contain:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.75 \text{ per razor} \]

Finally, we convert the cost per razor to cents:
\[ \$0.75 = 75 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the cost per individual razor after the discount and coupon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid based on that average height.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of girls in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of each cheerleader is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total height of the human pyramid is:

\[
\boxed{53}

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over the 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost for both morning and afternoon rides and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ morning rides}\).
- The total cost for morning rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides}\).
- The total cost for afternoon rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we sum the total costs for both morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{224}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges brought by Ashley. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- The cost of food for \( n \) guests is $25 per guest, which totals \( 25n \).
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  C_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[
C_1 = C_2
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so the number of insects found by Lily is \( D + 7 \). Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so if Bodhi found \( B \) insects, then \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) or \( B = 2D \).

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + B = 43 \]
Substituting \( B = 2D \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ D = 9 \]
Now, we can find the number of insects found by Lily, which is \( D + 7 \):
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that total into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The total amount of yarn used is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, the total yards of yarn used is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364
\]

To calculate this, we can perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

So, the total number of yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is 273 yards. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{273}

"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. 

For the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. 

Adding these to the gifts for her friends:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. According to the problem, the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \text{ feet} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). According to the problem, Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. Additionally, she bought a small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum. Therefore, the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[
2S + 2 + 1 = 7
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
2S + 3 = 7
\]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
2S = 4
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 2
\]

Thus, each pack of strawberry gum cost \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Frederick can get from the 2 x 4 pieces. Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks Frederick can get from the 2 x 8 pieces. Each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

\[
\text{Maximum number of sticks} = 1200
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1200}

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost of taking the bus without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.

The total number of bus trips per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

The total cost for these trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

The savings by buying the bus pass instead of paying for each trip individually is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

"Let's denote the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and \( S_p \) respectively.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the quantities Rose bought:

\[ 4 \times S_o = 12 \]
\[ 4 \times S_p = 4 \]

We can solve these equations to find \( S_o \) and \( S_p \).

First, solve for \( S_o \):

\[ S_o = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, solve for \( S_p \):

\[ S_p = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, to find the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we add \( S_o \) and \( S_p \):

\[ S_o + S_p = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

So, the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought is 4.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly consumption and cost for both scenarios.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device.**

- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost before adding the new device:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device.**

- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after adding the new device:
\[ \$21.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$147.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the weekly costs.**

Difference in weekly cost:

"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \) and the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O \). Substituting \( C_O = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \).
- Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \).

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{172}

"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the headphone set:**
   - Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
   - The CD cost $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the money spent on the headphone set:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - The number of CDs Tom could buy with $44 is:
     \[
     \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
     \]

Thus, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, let's establish the pattern:
- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total hours for each group of weeks:
1. For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up the total hours from all these weeks:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, i.e., \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 63 = 122 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, in 8 years, his cousin will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - Since his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - His cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine the constants:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate \( 2M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
2. The boys brought back 60 seashells each.
3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

First, let's determine the number of boys and girls:
- Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided equally into girls and boys, there are \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:
- Each boy brought 60 seashells.
- Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) seashells.

Now, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys:
- The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
- Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \).

Thus, the total number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George originally had.
2. According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick originally had \( 2G \) candies.
3. George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   G - 5 = 3
   \]
4. Solving for \( G \):
   \[
   G - 5 = 3 \implies G = 3 + 5 \implies G = 8
   \]
   So, George originally had 8 candies.
5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, we can calculate the number of candies Nick had:
   \[
   2G = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

Let's perform the addition step by step:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for the second half that will allow Elvis to meet his monthly target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings in the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half of the month would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the entire month would be the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly target is $1125, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since the daily savings in the second half are twice that of the first half, we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag. We know that there are 21 buttons in total, out of which 7 buttons have two holes each, and the remaining buttons have four holes each.

First, let's find out how many buttons have four holes:
\[ \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = \text{Total number of buttons} - \text{Number of buttons with two holes} \]
\[ \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with two holes:
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with two holes} = \text{Number of buttons with two holes} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with two holes} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with four holes:
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with four holes} = \text{Number of buttons with four holes} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with four holes} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Finally, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons to get the overall total number of holes:
\[ \text{Total number of holes} = \text{Total holes from buttons with two holes} + \text{Total holes from buttons with four holes} \]
\[ \text{Total number of holes} = 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we calculate the volume of Peter's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker (12 cubic inches) into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee per day.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee per day.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction in cups is:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3 in this case).

\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(10 \times 5 = 50\) degrees upward from the pyramid.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
   - After 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees higher than the initial position.
   - Therefore, the final angle of the sun from the ground will be \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. We know that one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

So, the ages of the sons are 12 and 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs to buy. Since he needs one candle for each son, he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ candles} \]

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \text{ packs} \]

Since James cannot buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 1 pack to have enough candles.

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:

\[ 1 \text{ pack} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pack} = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount James spends on candles is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, the number of pages she can read in 105 minutes is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

According to the problem, in 7 years:
- Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
- His nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.

The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, distribute the 3 on the right side:
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]

Next, isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as \( M \) and the number of goals scored by Anna as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \)
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \)
3. Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \)

First, we can substitute the value of \( R \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, we substitute the value of \( R \) into the second equation to find \( A \):
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we know the number of goals scored by each teenager:
- Mark scored 60 goals.
- Anna scored 35 goals.
- Richie scored 80 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum their individual scores:
\[ \text{Total goals} = M + A + R \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 60 + 35 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 175 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we first need to calculate the amount of money Mitchell made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made \(\boxed{21}\) more dollars than Liam."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Peter spends each day and then calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys over the week.

First, let's calculate the total amount Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can find the daily spending by dividing his total money by 4:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{4} = 17.5
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can determine how many wooden action figures he can buy in these 4 days:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{17.5}{5} = 3.5
\]

Since Peter cannot buy half an action figure, he can buy 3 wooden action figures. The cost for these 3 wooden action figures is:

\[
3 \times 5 = 15
\]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining money is:

\[
70 - 15 = 55
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $55 is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{55}{2} = 27.5
\]

Again, since Peter cannot buy half an action figure, he can buy 27 plastic action figures. The cost for these 27 plastic action figures is:

\[
27 \times 2 = 54
\]

After buying the plastic action figures, the remaining money is:

\[
55 - 54 = 1
\]

Since Peter does not have enough money to buy another action figure, he will not buy any more action figures.

Now, we sum the total number of action figures Peter has by the end of the week:

\[
\text{Total number of action figures} = 3 \text{ (wooden)} + 27 \text{ (plastic)} = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To find the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. The cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. The cost of the 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. The cost of repairing the 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
200 + 60 + 48 = 308
\]

So, the total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he needs to supply per week and then per month.

First, let's find out the total number of roses Ford needs to supply per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply per month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, we know that Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, the total number of roses he grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses he needs to supply:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of months in 2 years.
2. Determine the total amount of money removed from the account over these months.
3. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account.

First, we know that there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, in 2 years, there are:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, Katina removes $100 from her account every month. Over 24 months, the total amount removed is:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Katina initially has $3000 in her account. After 24 months, the remaining amount in her account will be:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total cost of bread:**
   - The cost of one loaf of bread is $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - They need to make 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, they need 1 loaf of bread.
   - Total cost of bread = $3.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost of cheese and condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost per sandwich:**
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.
   - Cost per sandwich = $33.00 / 10 = $3.30.

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

5. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Total cost = Cost per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.30 * 10 = $33.00.
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is \(\boxed{37.00}\)."

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = 2592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide this total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 50 + 50 = 100 \]
\[ 100 + 0 = 100 \]
\[ 100 + 120 = 220 \]
\[ 220 + 20 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 90 = 330 \]

So, the total number of birds seen over the week is 330.

Next, we calculate the average number of birds seen per day by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{330}{7} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{330}{7} \approx 47.14 \]

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

The first step is to find half of the starting value:
\[ \frac{S}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we add this half value to the starting value:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Then, we divide this sum by 5:
\[ \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Finally, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
\[ 6 \times (S - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Thus, the final value of the number train is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven's temperature setting and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference in temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature of 450 degrees. We need to apply the same 4% error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

To find the actual temperature that corresponds to 520 degrees, we need to set up the equation:
\[ 520 \times (1 + 0.04) = 520 \times 1.04 = 540.8 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

\[ 540.8 \]"
"To find out the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of the movies together.

First movie duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Second movie duration: 2 hours and 5 minutes

Convert the first movie duration to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Convert the second movie duration to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, add the two durations together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, the total time Max will take to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of Herb's house price = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house price = Herb's house price - 30% of Herb's house price
Juan's house price = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:

Combined value = Herb's house price + Juan's house price
Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final numerical answer is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy initially bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy initially bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
- Judy initially bought 12 cups.
- Her friend brought 40 cups.
- Total cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\).

Total dishes brought:
- Judy initially bought 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 44 dishes.
- Total dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Finally, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 + 68 = 120 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is calculated as follows:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts and each pair consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs per box is:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} \).

Let's calculate this:
- \( \frac{1600}{200} = 8 \)
- \( 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.

The final numerical answer is:
800"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we first need to determine the three measurements. The initial speed is 47 WPM, the speed after the first increase is 52 WPM, and the speed after the second increase is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and then divide by 3.

The sum of the three measurements is:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

The average is:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference in weight is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we will calculate the number of attendees step by step.

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   Alex initially invites 100 people.

2. **Friends Invited by Initial Invited:**
   Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 friends. Therefore, the number of friends invited by these 100 people is:
   \[
   100 \times 2 = 200
   \]

3. **Additional Invitations:**
   Alex calls 10 of her friends to invite them. Out of these 10 friends, 8 say they will be bringing their spouses. Therefore, the number of additional attendees from these 10 friends is:
   \[
   8
   \]

4. **Total Attendees:**
   Adding all the attendees together:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial invited)} + 200 \text{ (friends invited by initial invited)} + 8 \text{ (additional from friends)} = 308
   \]

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{308}\) seats."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(2 \times 10 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(44 \times 5 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in total costs between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can express the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^{n-1} \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- On day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^{1-1} = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- On day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^{2-1} = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- On day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^{3-1} = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- On day 4: \( h(4) = 4 \times 2^{4-1} = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

We see that on day 4, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet. Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on day 4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, we can find the protein content per gram by dividing the total protein by the total weight:
     \[
     \text{Protein per gram} = \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Using the protein content per gram, we can find the daily protein intake:
     \[
     \text{Daily protein intake} = 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work for George.

1. **Cost of the implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants.
   - Total cost for implants = 2 * $2000 = $4000.

2. **Additional cost for the porcelain crown:**
   - The porcelain crown costs an extra $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown = $500.

3. **Total cost of the dental work:**
   - Total cost = Cost of implants + Cost of porcelain crown
   - Total cost = $4000 + $500 = $4500.

Next, we need to determine how much more money George needs after his deposit.

4. **Remaining amount to be paid:**
   - Deposit already made = $600.
   - Remaining amount = Total cost - Deposit
   - Remaining amount = $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Now, we need to calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining $3900.

5. **Hours needed to work:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - Hours needed = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
   - Hours needed = $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work **260 hours** before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can determine the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

Among the angles 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees, the largest angle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

\[ 69 \]"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, we need to determine the new weight after Jamaal increases the weight by 50%.

The original weight is 8 pounds. A 50% increase means we calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to the original weight.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this to the original weight:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the new weight after the 50% increase is 12 pounds. Jamaal then uses a weight two pounds lighter than this new weight.

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance of 2000 miles and the speed of 400 miles per hour, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings for the first 4 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings for the next 2 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires will undergo in a month and then calculate how many months the tires will last before needing replacement. Finally, we will convert the number of months into years.

First, we calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month. We know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:

\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

So, the total number of rotations in 400 miles is:

\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we need to determine how many months the tires will last before needing replacement. Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. Since Jeremy has 4 tires (assuming a car has 4 tires), the total number of rotations the 4 tires can undergo together is:

\[ 4 \times 10,440,000 = 41,760,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, we calculate the number of months the tires will last:

\[ \frac{41,760,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 288 \text{ months} \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:

\[ \frac{288 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 24 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires will need to be replaced after 24 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of washes per bottle:**
   - The directions state that 2 pumps give 120 washes.
   - Therefore, 1 pump gives:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per wash:**
   - The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
   - There are 120 washes in the bottle.
   - The cost per wash is:
     \[
     \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
     \]

3. **Convert the cost per wash to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per wash in cents is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per wash}
     \]

4. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washes, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     60 \text{ washes} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is also a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:

\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ \boxed{65560} \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $100,000 per month.
   - The increased funding per month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total Funding for Extended Period:**
   - The cost for the 45 months is \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\).

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = $100,000 (initial) + $6,750,000 (extended) = $6,850,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{6850000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these values.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each an ounce in size, and there were 8 beef tips. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with step 1:

The auditorium has 4 rows of seats, with 18 seats in each row. Therefore, the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, step 2:
One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. So, the number of seats occupied by the administrators is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, step 3:
The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

For step 4:
One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Finally, step 5:
The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of poles across all intersections.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights based on the number of poles.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of poles across all intersections.**

Each intersection has 6 poles, and there are 4 intersections.
\[ \text{Total number of poles} = 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights.**

Each pole has 4 street lights.
\[ \text{Total number of street lights} = 24 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of functioning street lights.**

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ \text{Number of functioning street lights} = 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ street lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[
1 \text{ piece (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ piece (after dinner)} = 2 \text{ pieces}
\]

Adding these together, the total number of pieces Jim chews during the day is:

\[
4 \text{ pieces (during school)} + 2 \text{ pieces (other times)} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Jim then gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed. Therefore, the number of pieces he gives to his sister is:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Subtracting the pieces given to his sister from the remaining pieces, the number of pieces Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of flowers per row} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, determine the number of flowers that have bloomed. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed:
\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total number of flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the given speed to megabits per second (Mb/s):**
   - Ashley's speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s).
   - Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s:
     \[
     20 \text{ kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \text{ Mb/s} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

2. **Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
   - To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
     \[
     0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ \text{Cost paid by the company} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we determine the total profit James made from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Cost paid by the company} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

The number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = 2000 \)
- The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, so \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \).
- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so \( S = G - 400 \).

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we sum the number of each type of stamp:
\[

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead and Tom is driving 70 mph while Bob is driving 55 mph, the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can attend without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is not more than $10.

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{C}{n} \]

We need:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that Manny can miss up to \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Since they work all days of the week (7 days), we calculate the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. According to the problem, Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Let's denote Lynn's distance as \( L \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation by subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Thus, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

3. **Leather seats:** One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running boards:** $500 less than the cost of the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package:** $1,500

Now, summing all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base price} + \text{King cab} + \text{Leather seats} + \text{Running boards} + \text{Upgraded exterior light package}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 43,500
\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is \(\boxed{43500}\) dollars."
"To determine how much money Tim will make in a year after his promotion, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then find the annual income.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's original monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- The raise amount is \( 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \).

Adding the raise to his original salary:
- New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Next, we calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \).

Adding the bonus to the new monthly salary:
- Total monthly income = $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, to find the annual income, we multiply the total monthly income by 12 (months in a year):
- Annual income = $31000 \times 12 = $372000.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{372000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. Therefore, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since each suit costs $750, the cost of each pair of dress pants is:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. Therefore, the total number of dress shirts he buys is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we sum up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

Thus, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes in the month and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the number of articles published by the news website in February. The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the number of articles published by the sister company in February. The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. Since February also has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

Thus, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Steve's family members.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, so her age is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is \(\frac{64}{2} = 32\) years.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of flour in one bag:**
   - We know that one bag is divided into 8 portions, each weighing 2 kilograms.
   - Therefore, the total weight of flour in one bag is calculated by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:
     \[
     \text{Weight of one bag} = 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour in three bags:**
   - Since one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, three bags will contain:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of three bags} = 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa, the speed is 12 miles per hour and the time is 4.5 hours. So, the distance Alisa biked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked. The speed for Stanley is 10 miles per hour and the time is 2.5 hours. So, the distance Stanley biked is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add the distances together:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is:

\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

Three weeks after posting the photo, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. Therefore, the number of likes after three weeks is:
\[ 70 \times L = 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

If Fishio received 20000 more new likes recently, the total number of likes now is:
\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the 20 pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the 20 pomegranates on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800.

Next, we need to find the total sales for the first month. The total sales for the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time period:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid time = Total time - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs for the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $105."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \times \frac{1 \text{ whole egg}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The time to cook beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, and the total number of legs is 70.
2. Each sheep and each goose has one head, and the total number of heads is 20.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation to find \( g \):
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we can check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (5 \times 0.20) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, for a week (7 days), he will use:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The total cost for the coffee is:

\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:

\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they shared equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy.

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. We do this by adding the amounts of candy each person has:

\[
3 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to share this total amount of candy equally among the three individuals. To find out how much candy each person will have, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:

\[
\frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, each of them would have \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 candies of type A. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these up:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining six days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This indicates that the distribution over the first thirty days is consistent with the given numbers.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The first of these three days is good.
- The second is neutral.
- The third is good.

Adding these to the existing good days:
\[
8 \text{ (initial good days)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} + 1 \text{ (next good day)} = 10 \text{ good days}
\]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \). According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:

\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \( J \) with 21:

\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, we need to convert the initial height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the initial height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height between the target height and the current height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 8 new dogs} = 4 \]

After buying the toys for the 8 new dogs, the number of dogs in the shelter is now \(4 + 8 = 12\). At this point, James realizes there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, which means there are 12 more dogs than the initial 4 dogs. This is consistent with the current number of dogs being 12.

\[ \text{Current number of dogs} = 12 \]

Next, James goes back to see that there are now 12 dogs, and he had to buy toys for these 12 dogs. After that, 3 dogs leave, so he no longer needs the toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he needs to subtract the 3 dogs that left from the 12 dogs.

\[ \text{Toys needed for 12 dogs} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Toys needed for 9 dogs} = 12 - 3 = 9 \]

So, the total number of toys James needs is the sum of the toys he initially needed for the 8 new dogs and the toys he needs for the 9 dogs after the 3 dogs leave.

\[ \text{Total toys needed} = 4 + 9 = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240

"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We multiply her daily earnings by 2:

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load capacity of the elevator:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20} \text{ kg} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

First, we solve for \( M \) from the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \):
\[
M - 5 = 68 \implies M = 68 + 5 \implies M = 73
\]

Next, we find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using \( M = C + 12 \):
\[
73 = C + 12 \implies C = 73 - 12 \implies C = 61
\]

Now, we find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[
M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of cookies they all have:
\[
\text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
\]

Adding these together:
\[
68 + 73 = 141
\]
\[
141 + 61 = 202
\]
\[
202 + 96 = 298
\]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[
\boxed{298}

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress can be written as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the time he spent mowing the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes Chris 1 hour to mow the entire lawn. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, it takes him 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Chris mows half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode. Therefore, he spends 30 minutes mowing half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode (since 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes) and 20 minutes mowing the other half in ""rabbit"" mode (since 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes).

To find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn, we add the time spent in ""turtle"" mode and the time spent in ""rabbit"" mode:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract these from the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We are also given that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can write the second equation as:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins using the first equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 13 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework. The time required for each subject is as follows:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes John has to nap is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, the number of coins Neil saves per month is:

\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years (120 months), Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let the total bill be \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \):
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To solve for \( T \), we first isolate \( T \) on one side of the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple:
\[ \text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we calculate the price of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[ 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each colored square and then sum these areas.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement account} = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for this purpose.

\[ \text{Amount used for car payment} = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Amount left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 720 \]"
"To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. Given that the box can hold 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, we can calculate the number of pencils currently in the box as follows:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils in the box by 2:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:

\[ 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks that will be set off in the city display. There are 15 boxes of fireworks, with each box containing 20 fireworks. Therefore, the total number of fireworks in the city display is:

\[ 15 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ fireworks/box} = 300 \text{ fireworks} \]

Hannah's house is positioned to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks this is, we calculate 40% of 300:

\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \text{ fireworks} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She has 3 boxes of fireworks, with each box containing 5 fireworks. Therefore, the total number of fireworks in her backyard display is:

\[ 3 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ fireworks/box} = 15 \text{ fireworks} \]

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks she sees in the city display to the number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

\[ 120 \text{ fireworks} + 15 \text{ fireworks} = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

Thus, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. Therefore, the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person occupies one seat, and each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, there are 20 seats, and thus 20 drinks and 20 snacks are needed.

The cost of each drink is $2, and the cost of each snack is also $2. Therefore, the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 20 \text{ drinks} \times \$2/\text{drink} = \$40 \]

Similarly, the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ snacks} \times \$2/\text{snack} = \$40 \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the cost of the snacks gives the total amount spent:

\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Thus, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{80} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, we get the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received based on the given ratio of 3:2 and the total amount of $100.

The total ratio parts are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Gerald's share is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $100, and Julia's share is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of $100.

Calculating Gerald's share:
\[
\text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60
\]

Julia's share is:
\[
\text{Julia's share} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, we account for the $10 that Gerald spent on a book. We subtract this amount from Gerald's initial share:
\[
\text{Gerald's remaining money} = 60 - 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:
\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that they raise an equal amount in every hour.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Thus, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city.
2. Determine the percentage of the city's water usage that is used for industrial purposes.
3. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total city usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city.
- Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the city's water usage that is used for industrial purposes.
- 80% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the city's water usage that is used for non-industrial purposes.
- The percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is the total city usage minus the industrial usage.
- This can be calculated as: \(40\% - 80\% \times 40\%\).

First, convert the percentages to decimals for easier calculation:
- \(40\% = 0.40\)
- \(80\% = 0.80\)

Now, calculate the industrial usage in terms of the total river water:
- \(0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32\)

This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

Next, calculate the non-industrial usage:
- \(0.40 - 0.32 = 0.08\)

Convert this back to a percentage:
- \(0.08 = 8\%\)

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(8\%\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

Thus, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of croissants + Cost of cinnamon rolls + Cost of mini quiches + Cost of blueberry muffins
Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost - Discount amount
Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops.

First, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00. Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 3 scoops, the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

With $6.00, the number of sets of 3 scoops she can buy is:
\[ \frac{6.00}{4.50} = \frac{600}{450} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \]

Since she can only buy whole sets, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops. This means she will get 2 scoops paid for and 1 free scoop. The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

After buying 2 scoops, she will have:
\[ 6.00 - 3.00 = 3.00 \]

With the remaining $3.00, she can buy another set of 3 scoops, but since she can only buy whole sets, she can only buy another set of 3 scoops, which costs $4.50, leaving her with:
\[ 3.00 - 4.50 = -1.50 \]

Since she cannot spend more than she has, she cannot buy another set of 3 scoops. Therefore, the total number of scoops she can buy is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over the two-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area.

First, calculate the area that needs to be covered:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, the total number of tiles required for 24 square feet is:
\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

The fixed fee is $20.
The variable fee is $1.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the variable cost is:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the fixed and variable costs gives the total cost James incurred:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars} + 45 \, \text{dollars} = 65 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ 75 \, \text{dollars} - 65 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the amount James saved is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original total cost for 500 computers is:
\[ 500 \times 700 = 350000 \]

Since this is the total cost for 500 computers, the original price per computer is:
\[ \frac{350000}{500} = 700 \]

Next, we need to find the new price of each computer after a 10% increase. A 10% increase on the original price of $700 is:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]
So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"

   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses 2 oz of ham.
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, we sum up the calories from all the ingredients:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the omelet is 770 calories."

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3} \times 12\right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times 12\right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes, so the time for the dog is:

\[
\text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Now, we sum the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[
64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to determine the total number of spools of thread and the number of blue spools.

The total number of spools is calculated as follows:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools.

The number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools:
Number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 spools.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40\% \]"
"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000 people lined up at the polling station.

2. **People who voted by midday**:
   - \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted by midday.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\).

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Number of people remaining = Total number of people - Number of people who voted by midday.
   - Remaining people = \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\).

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted by 16:00.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\).

5. **People who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = Remaining people after midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00.
   - Number of people who had not voted by 16:00 = \(3000 - 2000 = 1000\).

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the total number of pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{pieces per day} \times \text{number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{pieces per pack}} \]
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15} = 8 \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. So, the total number of smores required is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 2 \text{ smores per adult} = 18 + 12 = 30 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 30 smores. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores. Therefore, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3.75 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a sleeve, we need to round up to the next whole number. Thus, they will need 4 sleeves of graham crackers.

Now, we need to determine how many boxes of graham crackers are required. Each box contains 3 sleeves. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1.3333 \text{ boxes} \]

Again, since we cannot purchase a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Thus, they will need 2 boxes of graham crackers.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
Substituting the father's age:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[ \boxed{87} \]"

"First, let's determine the weight of each book Cindy has:

- Math and science books: Each weighs 2 pounds. Since she has two of these books, the total weight is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
- English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
- History book: Weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we sum up the weights of all the books:

\[
4 \text{ (math and science books)} + 4 \text{ (French book)} + 3 \text{ (English book)} + 6 \text{ (history book)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. The votes received by candidate A and candidate B are 20 and 30 respectively. Therefore, the votes received by candidate C are:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each person has is updated as follows:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
2"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Clara has two times as many books as Steven. We are given that Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2S = 20
\]

Solving for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[
A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We already know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[
20 - 16 = 4
\]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[
\text{Cost of 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[
\text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{98}

"Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of students is 50.
- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.
- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball.

So, we can write the following equations based on the information given:
\[ V + M = 50 - 10 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \times 5 \]

First, calculate \( M \):
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, substitute \( M \) into the first equation:
\[ V + 10 = 50 - 10 - 5 \]
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \( 25 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Adding these together gives us the total number of animals:

\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom over the course of 7 days. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards, each costing $1800.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the daily savings and then extend that to a weekly savings.

First, let's calculate the daily savings:
- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily savings per tomato:
\[ 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

Total daily savings:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 0.1 \text{ dollars/tomato} = 50 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by doubling the number of marbles Sean has:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying the number of marbles Sean has by 4:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:
\[
\text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Total number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question seems to have a logical inconsistency.

However, if we were to interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups (as initially stated), we can calculate that as follows:

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Initial number of groups = 6

To find the number of students per group when divided into 6 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Initial number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Since 9 students per group is a whole number, it is possible to form 6 groups of 9 students each.

If the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups from 12 groups, the answer would be:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed to form 6 groups from 12 groups is 6.

However, since the question asks for the number of additional groups needed to form 6 groups from the initial 6 groups, the answer is:
\[ 6 - 6 = 0 \]

Therefore, no additional groups are needed to form 6 groups from the initial 6 groups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the weekly rental for weekdays and weekends:
- Weekdays: 5 days a week, 60 chairs rented each day.
  \[
  5 \text{ days/week} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 300 \text{ chairs/week}
  \]
- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 200 \text{ chairs/week}
  \]

Next, we add the weekly rental numbers to get the total weekly rental:
\[
300 \text{ chairs/week} + 200 \text{ chairs/week} = 500 \text{ chairs/week}
\]

Now, we calculate the total rental for one 4-week month:
\[
500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2000 \text{ chairs}
\]

Since we are considering two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one 4-week month by 2:
\[
2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}
\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know that the total monthly cost for electricity is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate pays each month:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost per roommate by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. Similarly, the number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses and plates that were returned is:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

So, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{107}\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to sum the matches he played on each day of the week.

1. Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. Joey played 1 match on Friday.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75.

\[
\boxed{75}

"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final numerical answer is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists.
2. Determine the total duration of all songs combined.

First, we calculate the total number of songs in all playlists:
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist} \]
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all songs combined:
\[ \text{Total duration} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Duration of each song} \]
\[ \text{Total duration} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total duration of the 20 playlists is:

"First, let's determine the number of people who think horse #2 will win. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This means the remaining number of people is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. Given that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This means the rest of the people, who are the remaining 16 people, think horse #12 will win. Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the total puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister has an allowance of $90. Half of this amount is:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Jayden receives $45 from his sister. Adding this to the $70 he already had, we get:
\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The cost of the new camera is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the camera:
\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{85}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \). According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house will need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
5x = 500
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs \( x \) cases, which is 100 cases. Therefore, the third house will need:

\[
\boxed{100}

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to determine how many pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 45\% \times \text{Number of bananas} \]
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200 \]
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 \]
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 \]
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"To determine how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Therefore, her earnings for teaching on Monday are calculated as follows:
  \[
  4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = 4 \times 75 = \$300
  \]
- Additionally, since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an extra $5 per day.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are:
  \[
  \$300 + \$5 = \$305
  \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Therefore, her earnings for teaching on Wednesday are calculated as follows:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = 2 \times 30 = \$60
  \]
- Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
  \[
  \$60
  \]

**Total Earnings for Monday and Wednesday:**
- Adding the earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
  \[
  \$305 + \$60 = \$365

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours.

Next, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving to the museum, the time spent at the museum, and the time spent driving back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

So, the price you have to pay after the discount is $800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies that are in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
\]

Next, we find the number of movies that are not in series:

\[
\text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these non-series movies are older movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
\]

The remaining non-series movies are not older movies:

\[
\text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
\]

The cost of the older movies is:

\[
\text{Cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
\]

The cost of the non-older non-series movies is:

\[
\text{Cost of non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
\]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, their hiking speed is:

\[
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[
\text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours, with 1.5 hours spent hiking. Therefore, the time spent driving is:

\[
6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Using their driving speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is:

\[
\text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:

\[
\boxed{255}

"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:

\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points Ava earns are calculated as follows:
- Points from jumping on enemies: \( 10 \times E_A \)
- Points from collecting berries: \( 5 \times B_A \)
- Points from finishing the level: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \) (since she finishes 4 seconds slower, she gets 30 points for each second less than 60 seconds)

So, Ava's total score \( S_A \) is:
\[ S_A = 10 \times E_A + 5 \times B_A + 1680 \]

Similarly, the points Emma earns are calculated as follows:
- Points from jumping on enemies: \( 10 \times E_E \)
- Points from collecting berries: \( 5 \times B_E \)
- Points from finishing the level: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \)

So, Emma's total score \( S_E \) is:
\[ S_E = 10 \times E_E + 5 \times B_E + 1680 \]

Now, substituting \( E_A = E_E + 8 \) and \( B_A = B_E + 3 \) into the expressions for \( S_A \) and \( S_E \), we get:
\[ S_A = 10 \times (E_E + 8) + 5 \times (B_E + 3) + 1680 \]
\[ S_A = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + 1680 \]
\[ S_A = 10E_E + 5B_E + 1795 \]

And for Emma:
\[ S_E = 10 \times E_E + 5 \times B_E + 1680 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ S_A - S_E = (10E_E + 5B_E + 1795) - (10E_E + 5B_E + 1680) \]
\[ S_A - S_E = 1795 - 1680 \]
\[ S_A - S_E = 115 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{115}\)."

   \]

5. **Cost of Each of the Other Two Pizzas:**
   Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the weekly riding schedule into two parts: the usual days and the special days.

1. **Usual Days**: Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day. There are 5 such days in a week.
   - Number of rides per usual day = 3
   - Total rides on usual days = 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

2. **Special Days**: On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. So, they ride 6 times a day on these days.
   - Number of rides per special day = 6
   - Total rides on special days = 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

3. **Total Rides in a Week**: Sum the rides from the usual days and the special days.

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify our solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding these fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish (16) is indeed twice the number of white fish (8).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy drives from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - For 5 days, the total distance driven is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of gas consumed:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - Therefore, the amount of gas consumed for 50 miles is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the gas consumed:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming **$15** per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of 140 quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of 10 twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. Therefore, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Carrie spent in total. She spent all 140 quarters and 120 dollars from the twenties. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, we can find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Given that the temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = \text{Day temperature} - 33 \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The temperature during the night is 12 degrees, and the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised by:

\[ \text{Temperature to be raised} = 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Thus, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Now, Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage:**
   \[
   \text{Initial wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after raise} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = \$10.50 + \$1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}

Next, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours for Billy at each wage level:

1. **Initial wage:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$200
   \]

2. **Wage after 2 months:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
   \]

3. **Wage on first anniversary:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
   \]

Now, let's determine Sally's hourly wage. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial wage:

\[
\text{Sally's initial wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings for 20 hours for Sally:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
\]

Finally, we find the difference in total earnings between Billy and Sally:

\[
\text{Difference in earnings} = \$230 - \$210 = \$20

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she has played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she has played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the first car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the second car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}

"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: \( 340 \) students.
- Fourth graders: \( 40 \) students.
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \) students.

Now, we sum the total number of students who passed:

\[ 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \]

The total number of students tested is:

\[ 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \]

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested:

\[ \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 70\% \).

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can create with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area and the height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag contains 72 chips.
- Milo has two bags.
- Therefore, the total number of chips is \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make every square inch.
- Therefore, the total area in square inches is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

Now, we know the height of the mosaic is 3 inches. To find the length, we use the area formula for a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for the length:
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students have consumed the tea. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

3. **Additional Order:**
   - Dale then ordered 100 more candies.

4. **Total Candies Now:**
   - After ordering 100 more candies, Dale now has:
     \[
     100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
     \]

5. **Total Candies Sold:**
   - Dale has sold 150 candies.

6. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
     \[
     200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (candies sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
     \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **Number of students at the end of each month**:
   - **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
   - **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
   - **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
   - **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
   - **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

3. **Total number of students by the end of May**:
   - Total students = Students at the end of May = 320

4. **Number of students who joined by the end of May**:
   - Students who joined = Total students by the end of May - Initial number of students
   - Students who joined = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{310}

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower from each of the four groups:
- 1 flower from the first group (5 petals) drops, leaving \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) petals.
- 1 flower from the second group (6 petals) drops, leaving \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) petals.
- 1 flower from the third group (4 petals) drops, leaving \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) petals.
- 1 flower from the fourth group (7 petals) drops, leaving \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) petals.

Now, we sum the remaining petals:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{101} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. Each S'more uses one marshmallow, and John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows used is:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have is the number of marshmallows left divided by 2 (since the marshmallows are shared between John and DeSean). Therefore, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time each person plays and then calculate the total number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total play time from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the play times for each person:
1. **Jack**: He can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
2. **Friend 1**: He can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
   \[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
3. **Friend 2**: He can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
   \[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
4. **Friend 3**: He can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
   \[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the total play time for all four friends:
\[ \text{Total play time} = 20 + 10 + 10 + 30 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows 20 minutes of play, we need to determine how many quarters are required for 70 minutes of play:
\[ \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{70}{20} = 3.5 \]

Since Jack and his friends can only use whole quarters, they will need to use 4 quarters to cover the total play time of 70 minutes.

Thus, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we can express the total amount of ingredients used in terms of \( S \):
- Salt (S) = \( S \)
- Oil (O) = \( 2S \)
- Fragrance (F) = \( S \)
- Citrus zest (C) = \( S \)
- Sugar (G) = \( S \)

The total amount of ingredients used is:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = S + 2S + S + S + S = 6S \]

We know that the total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces:
\[ 6S = 10 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( 2S \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

Thus, the amount of oil used is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4500}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars and gives away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he gives away or sells is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Calculate the total time in hours.
4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

**Step 1: Time walked on the first day**
Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

**Step 2: Time walked on the second day**
Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day. Therefore, the time walked on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 3: Total time in hours**
The total time Sandy walked over the two days is the sum of the time walked on the first day and the second day:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 4: Convert total time to minutes**
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contains 11 tins, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contains 6 tins, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know \( P \), we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards:

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refundable amount from Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be shipped 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable amount from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the net loss by subtracting the refundable amount from the total shipping cost:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the negative value indicates a loss, the amount Milly will lose is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"

Next, we need to account for the expenses Mulan made:

\[ \text{Cost of two pairs of jeans} = 2 \times \$30 = \$60 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the bag} = \$20 \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$60 + \$20 = \$80 \]

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos per week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - For a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.

   - The base installation includes:
     - 4 mirrors
     - 2 shelves
     - 1 chandelier
     - 10 pictures

2. **Additional Items Calculation:**
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base installation already includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, the additional items Angela needs are:
     - Additional mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
     - Additional chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
     - Additional pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

3. **Cost for Additional Items:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Total cost for additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Total cost for additional chandeliers: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
   - Total cost for additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\)

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Base cost: $129.00

"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the animals, the distance they travel, and the time it takes.

First, let's denote the speed of the kangaroos as \( v \) (in distance units per hour). The total time taken for 3 kangaroos to travel across the highway is 18 hours. Therefore, the total distance \( D \) across the highway can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \). The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t = 2vt \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]

We can solve for \( t \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 2v \):
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of dishes made by Kora as \( K \), Rory as \( R \), and Jada as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 \).
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2R \).

First, we calculate the number of dishes Rory made:
\[ R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the number of dishes Jada made:
\[ J = 2R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[ J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount of money she has is $400 - $50 = $350. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]

To find the money in her purse, we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Thus, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces and Adam slices 3 large apples, the total number of slices from the large apples is:

\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces and Adam slices 5 small apples, the total number of slices from the small apples is:

\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:

\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 mm
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \) mm

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 mm
   - Used portion: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) mm

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 mm
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) mm

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[ 10 \text{ mm} + 4 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 20 \text{ mm} \]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into this equation, we get \( 60 = 2S \), which simplifies to \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) items.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then add the intermission time. The total time for one group is:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes (setup)} + 6 \text{ minutes (performance)} + 2 \text{ minutes (exit)} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The intermission time is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for one group including the intermission is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is \(3 \times 12 = 36\).
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, the number of homes built in the third year is \(2 \times 48 = 96\).

Now, to find the total number of homes built over the three years, we sum the homes built each year:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), substituting \( B = Y + 3 \), we get \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now, substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
Divide by 6:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To verify, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, let's determine how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips as follows:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received in tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which means she received:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's total tips} + \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges Claire earns in a year:
- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges in a year.

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Amber to earn a badge:
- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.
- Claire takes 1 month to earn a badge.
- Therefore, Amber takes \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \) months to earn a badge.

Now, we calculate the number of badges Amber earns in a year:
- Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- The number of 2-month periods in a year is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \).
- Therefore, Amber earns \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \) badges in a year.

Next, we calculate the number of badges Wendy earns in a year:
- Wendy earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns in the same time frame.
- Claire earns 12 badges in a year.
- Therefore, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges in a year.

Finally, we find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns:
- Wendy earns 36 badges.
- Amber earns 6 badges.
- The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

Given that \( G = 70 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins \( S \), we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = G + S \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."

Next, add the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George:
\[ \text{Burritos eaten by Mr. George} = 20 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos distributed} = 500 + 20 = 520 \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos distributed from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ \text{Total burritos ordered} = 600 \]
\[ \text{Total leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80 \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

1. **Red Cars**: Given as 12.
2. **Green Cars**: 2 fewer than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Green Cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: 3 times the number of green cars.
   \[
   \text{Blue Cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total of Red, Green, and Blue Cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Yellow Cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]
\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of books Fawn has} = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds and the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we can calculate the weight of the carrots as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of small jello cups Greg wants to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. We know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 500 \]"
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month, and then find out how much Keenan pays per week.

1. **Total monthly cost**: $400
2. **Madeline's share**: 60% of $400
   \[
   \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Keenan's share**: The remaining 40% of $400
   \[
   \text{Keenan's share} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Monthly cost per week**: Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month,
   \[
   \text{Monthly cost per week} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Keenan's weekly cost**: Since Keenan's monthly cost is $160, we divide this by 4 to find the weekly cost.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and per bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00.

First, we calculate the cost per bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we determine the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the marbles from his friend:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, so the difference is:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the profit Sarah will make from selling the rope. Since she sells it for $2 per meter and the cost price is $1.5 per meter, the profit per meter is:

\[
\text{Profit per meter} = 2 \text{ dollars/meter} - 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 0.5 \text{ dollars/meter}
\]

Now, we calculate the total profit Sarah will make from selling the 20 meters of rope:

\[
\text{Total profit} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use this $10 profit to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total profit by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{10}{1.5} = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 6 meters of the new rope. The cost for 6 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost for 6 meters} = 6 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 9 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from her total profit:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 10 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To solve this problem, let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie's current age is 8 years.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( y \). In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + y \). We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 3 times 8:
\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is given by:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesdays**: The shop makes 125 chimichangas.
2. **Wednesdays**: The shop also makes 125 chimichangas.
3. **Fridays**: The shop makes twice as many chimichangas as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Since they make 125 chimichangas on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays, on Fridays they make \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the number of chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500 \]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones were successfully paired and then calculate the number of pairs.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Consequently, the number of microphones that will be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

"To determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

Total petals for orchids = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid
Total petals for orchids = 5 × 5 = 25 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.

Total petals for daisies = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy
Total petals for daisies = 4 × 10 = 40 petals

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
Difference = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
Difference = 40 - 25 = 15 petals

Therefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

"Let's break down the costs Ellen incurs each day:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. Therefore, the total cost for her daily diet is:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 2C + 9 \]

We know that the total cost for her goods is $11. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

To find the cost of one carrot (\( C \)), we solve the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]
\[ 2C = 11 - 9 \]
\[ 2C = 2 \]
\[ C = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns in the first two weeks is:
\[ x + 3x + 5x = 9x \]

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 9x \times 6 = 54x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month were $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is $54x. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 54x \]

Since we don't have the specific value of \( x \), we can't determine the exact numerical value of \( 54x \). However, we can express the earnings from lemonade sales in terms of \( x \):
\[ 80 - 54x \]

Without additional information about \( x \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. If we assume \( x = 1 \) (which is a reasonable assumption given the problem's context), then:
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, if \( x = 1 \), Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales. However, since the problem does not specify \( x \), the final numerical answer in terms of \( x \) is:
\[ 80 - 54x \]

If we assume \( x = 1 \), the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Given that Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we find Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting his car and then subtract his monthly car payment.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month:
\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Now, we subtract his monthly car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

So, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Consequently, Joseph had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
notebooks.

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we need to first determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\):
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10
\]

So, Anis rowed:
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, to find the total distance both rowed, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:
\[
50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[
\boxed{110}

   Susan made 100 cookies.

2. **Subtract the cookies taken by the husband:**
   The husband took 4 cookies.
   \[
   100 - 4 = 96
   \]
   So, there are 96 cookies left.

3. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews:**
   \[
   \frac{96}{6} = 16
   \]

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's summarize the information given:

- Yesterday:
  - Denise read 10 pages.
  - Daniel read 13 pages.

- Today:
  - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
  - Daniel read 0 pages today.

From the information above, we can calculate the number of pages Denise read today:

- Denise read 10 pages yesterday.
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
- Today, Denise read \(10 + 5 = 15\) pages.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Denise's total pages:
  - Yesterday: 10 pages
  - Today: 15 pages
  - Total: \(10 + 15 = 25\) pages

- Daniel's total pages:
  - Yesterday: 13 pages
  - Today: 0 pages
  - Total: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

\[ 25 - 13 = 12 \]

Thus, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is available and how it can be distributed among the family members.

First, let's establish the capacity of the pot:
- The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls.
- The pot can also fill 8 child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will have one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will have one bowl of soup. This accounts for 2 adult bowls.

This leaves us with 2 bowls of soup to be distributed among the two children. Since each child can have one bowl, the two children will each have one bowl of soup.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and the answer is:

\[

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. Therefore, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. Therefore, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Material for 20 small masks = \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Material for 8 large masks = \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material required = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies that Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on various activities and then subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. **Time Harold sleeps**: 10 hours.
2. **Time Harold works**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Time Harold walks his dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time spent} = \text{Time sleeping} + \text{Time working} + \text{Time walking dog} \]
\[ \text{Total time spent} = 10 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours. Therefore, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ \text{Free time} = \text{Total hours in a day} - \text{Total time spent} \]
\[ \text{Free time} = 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of blue and red shoe boxes Tim has:

- Blue shoe boxes: 7
- Red shoe boxes: 9

Next, Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes. So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Then, Tim uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes. The number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Now, we can summarize the number of blue and red shoe boxes left:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 6

The final answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean has 30 marbles and he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. 

To find 1/5 of 30:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the marbles given to Jamie and Donald from the total number of marbles Dean originally had:
\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

We can solve this equation for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find the size of Farmer Smith's farm, we calculate:
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \times \text{Size of Farmer Brown's farm} + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \times 200 + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 400 + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ \text{Total acres} = \text{Size of Farmer Brown's farm} + \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} \]
\[ \text{Total acres} = 200 + 500 \]
\[ \text{Total acres} = 700 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in total for the eight-hour workday, we multiply the total number of packages by the amount he earns per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons as \( 3Y \). According to the problem, the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

To find \( Y \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we will calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the hours worked on Wednesday are:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the hours worked on Thursday are:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine spent and then divide that amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets Larry has:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha collects shells every month. From the age of 5 to her 10th birthday, she will have collected shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months. Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and then find the number of cups of mint tea in each row.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. Let's denote the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row as \( x \) and the number of cups of mint tea in each row as \( x \) (since the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row is equal).

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile tea is \( 3x \) and the total number of cups of mint tea is also \( 3x \). The total number of cups of tea is the sum of the cups of chamomile tea, mint tea, and cinnamon tea. We know that the total number of cups of tea is 27, and she brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined is \( 27 - 15 = 12 \).

This means:
\[ 3x + 3x = 12 \]
\[ 6x = 12 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, there are 2 cups of chamomile tea and 2 cups of mint tea in each row. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip given the constraints.

First, let's break down the information provided:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down to the ground and back up to the tree).
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

We need to find the number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip. Let's denote the number of berries the sloth picks up per trip as \( x \).

Since the sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip, we can calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Number of trips in 8 hours} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Given that the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 trips in that time, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from his total monthly budget of $150:
\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10 per movie. We need to find out how many movies he can see with $126, considering he has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, totaling 13 movies.

The cost for 13 movies is:
\[ 13 \times 10 = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has already spent $130 on 13 movies, he has no money left to see any more movies. Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is:
\[ 126 - 130 = -4 \]

Since he cannot spend more than he has, the number of additional movies he can see is 0.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"

The total number of other toys Sophie had initially is:
- 31 building blocks
- 8 stuffed animals
- 9 stacking rings

So, the total number of these toys is:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean by \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also received 2 water balloons, making the total \(8 + 2 = 10\) water balloons.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons, the total number of water balloons is \(10 + 15 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is 25."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

4. Calculate the number of tables needed:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. Calculate the number of new tables needed:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

Thus, the charity group needs 15 new tables. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is:
410 feet"
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling these widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Difference in revenue: \(\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800\)

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost under the 24-hour option:
- The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.
- Cameron's stay is from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours.
- Since the 24-hour option is already 1600 pesos, Cameron would not pay extra for the additional hours.

So, the cost under the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.
- Cameron's stay is 17 hours, so he needs to pay for 5 additional hours.
- The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos.
- Therefore, the cost for the additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.
- The total cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option is \(1000 + 350 = 1350\) pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The cost under the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.
- The cost under the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1350 pesos.
- The savings is \(1600 - 1350 = 250\) pesos.

Thus, Cameron would save \(\boxed{250}\) pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times \text{Hay per goat} - 3 = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the cost of gas, which is $50. So, after spending $50 on gas, his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract this amount from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for 5 pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"

"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"First, let's determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery had last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can set up the following expression to find the number of loaves the bakery had:

\[
\text{Number of loaves the bakery had} = 7 \times \text{Number of loaves Sam had} - 40
\]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[
\text{Number of loaves the bakery had} = 7 \times 70 - 40
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
7 \times 70 = 490
\]

Next, subtract 40 from 490:

\[
490 - 40 = 450

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:

"To find Leo's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, substitute Deanna's age into the second equation to find Marcus's age:
\[ M = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now, substitute Marcus's age into the first equation to find Leo's age:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To solve for \( L \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \) using the second equation:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation. From the first equation, we know \( B = A + 20 \). Substituting \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = B - 10 = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) into the third equation, we get:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness in inches} \times \text{Pages per inch} \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

Since each page is printed on both sides of the paper, the total number of pages in the book is the same as the total number of pages counted in the thickness.

"First, we need to determine the total duration Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

To find the total time in minutes:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
- Total reports: \( 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at \( 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \).

4. **Calculate the time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 9 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Converting this to minutes: \( 9 \times 60 + 55 = 540 + 55 = 595 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early:**
   - Total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early: \( 23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \).

6. **Calculate the actual sleep time on the bed:**
   - Subtract the total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early from the usual sleep duration:
   - Actual sleep time: \( 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. We know he has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find Shawna's father's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Shawna's age.
2. Use Shawna's age to find her father's age.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Use the information about the number of holes at the end of the third day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. Let \(H\) be the number of holes at the end of the first day. Then:
\[29 = 4H\]
Solving for \(H\):
\[H = \frac{29}{4} = 7.25\]

This means that at the end of the first day, there were 7.25 holes. However, since the number of holes must be a whole number, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Given the context, we can assume the problem is set up in a way that the fractional part is not relevant to the integer count of holes dug on the fourth day.

Now, we need to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day. By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. On the fourth day, they found a treasure chest, so the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the third day and the number of holes at the end of the third day (since they found the treasure chest and did not dig any more holes):
\[29 - 29 = 0\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[\boxed{0}\]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number that Amora and Lainey each received. Therefore, Collins received:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, let's calculate the total:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can verify by finding \( X \):

\[
X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Check the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode.

It is also given that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, we can write:
\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting \( M = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:
\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's convert the quantities of brownies into individual brownies. We know that one dozen equals 12 brownies.

Greta made a batch for herself:
\[ 1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies} \]

At her office, she received:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies} \]

When she arrived home, her friends gave her:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[ 1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies} \]

Now, let's sum up all the brownies Greta received:
\[ 12 \text{ (from herself)} + 6 \text{ (from the office)} + 48 \text{ (from her friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means her age is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"

   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Time for polyester string racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Time for hybrid sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all the racquets:
\[ 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure and the number of phones John is buying.

1. The first two phones cost the full price of $600 each.
2. Each phone after the first two is half price, which means each of these additional phones costs $600 / 2 = $300.

John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

- Cost of the first 2 phones: \(2 \times 600 = 1200\)
- Cost of the additional 2 phones (each at half price): \(2 \times 300 = 600\)

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[1200 + 600 = 1800\]

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. We know that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players.

First, we calculate the number of players on Zeke's team:
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:
\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} = 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Thus, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 9 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 180 \text{ oranges} \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \). According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

We need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This can be calculated by adding the number of states in the USA and the number of states in India:

\[
x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right)
\]

First, let's combine the terms:

\[
x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4
\]

To find the total number of states, we need to determine the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide a specific value for \( x \). Typically, the number of states in the USA is 50. Let's substitute \( x = 50 \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79
\]

Thus, the total number of states in both countries together is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $39. Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the items. We subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the items. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to determine how many hours he needs to work to earn $25. We divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the gingerbread and apple pie.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Price per box of gingerbread: $6
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Price per box of apple pie: $15
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we sum up the total earnings from both days.

**Total earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over the 8 days.
2. Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.
3. Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover the total amount of sunscreen needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside.**

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day for 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.**

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour. Therefore, for 32 hours, she will need:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required.**

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles are needed for 32 ounces, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the cost of the red car, we first need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:

\[ \$60 + \$100 = \$160 \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as \( D \) and the current age of his brother as \( B \).

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age of Emil's dad when he turns 24. Since Emil is currently 19, he will turn 24 in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years.

At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. At that time, Emil will be 24 years old, so his brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old. According to the problem:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by each person:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Therefore, the sister gave \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Therefore, the friend gave \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Next, we sum the beads given by each person to find the total number of beads Adrianne has:

\[
20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90
\]

Thus, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Given that 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. This is calculated by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band as follows:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

Adding the number of football players and the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band, we get the total number of students who need to leave early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size 5 and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times \text{Size of Sophie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, we have the sizes of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots: 25 and 5, respectively. To find the average size, we sum these sizes and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower growth and spacing. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:

\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, each plant (including the space between them) takes up:

\[ 12 \text{ inches (flower)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 1332 inches of the flower bed:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we take the integer part:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} \]

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels his brother eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract this from the total amount of soil available.

1. **Calculate the soil used by the sunflowers:**
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   \[
   \text{Soil used by sunflowers} = 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the soil used by the carnations:**
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   \[
   \text{Soil used by carnations} = 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations:**
   \[
   \text{Total soil used} = 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining soil available for roses:**
   - They have a 30-pound bag of soil.
   \[
   \text{Remaining soil} = 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil:**
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   \[
   \text{Number of roses} = \frac{3 \text{ pounds}}{1 \text{ pound/rose}} = 3 \text{ roses}
   \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time required for Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's determine the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's determine the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time required to sauté 90 shrimp is:
\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the tasks of peeling and sautéing are independent, the total time required is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling = 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling = 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming = 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, we sum up the cooling and warming effects:
- Total cooling = 6 degrees (low setting) + 12 degrees (high setting) = 18 degrees.
- Total warming = 4 degrees (no air conditioner).

The net change in temperature is:
- Net change = Total cooling - Total warming = 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees.

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees during the period when the air conditioner was not running, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the room is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to establish the age of Bill's father when he first saw the comet and then use that information to determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he first saw the comet:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: He writes a check for the gas bill once per month, which also amounts to 12 checks per year.
3. **Church**: He writes a check to the church twice per month, which means he writes 2 checks per month. Over the course of a year, this totals 24 checks.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: He writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) for pest and lawn service. This means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks he writes per year:

\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

\[

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias's howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds.
   - \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote.
   - Combined duration of Tobias and Chikote: \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined duration of all three wolves' howls:**
   - Sum the durations of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.
   - Total duration: \( 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert the total duration from seconds to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - \( 120 \) seconds is \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Adam received from his parents and the amount he spent on the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the amount he spent on the trousers:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

According to the problem, Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund, and then find out the total amount collected overall.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

So, the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

Thus, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6000. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church.
3. Calculate the number of people in the church based on the number of cookies given to each person.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.**

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies were given to the church.**

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church:
\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church.**

Each person in the church received 15 cookies. Therefore, the number of people in the church is:
\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon.

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[
9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatients from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

\[
180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[
10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

Again, we need to convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[
300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatients and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[
3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[
9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the entire cake-making process.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:

2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$480**."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m \).

We are given:
- Peter has 64 chocolate bars, so \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so \( 7m = 56 \).

We can solve for \( p \) and \( m \) from these equations.

For Peter:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ p = 16 \]

For Martha:
\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year. Initially, there are 50 porcupines. After a year, the total number of porcupines will be the initial number plus the number of babies born:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The conversion factor is 1 cubic foot = 7.48052 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( V_{\text{gallons}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48052 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48052 = 10472.728 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472.728 \times 0.10 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ C = 10472.728 \times 0.10 = 1047.2728 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent (since currency is typically expressed to two decimal places):
\[ C \approx 1047.27 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.27} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of sticks is:

"First, we calculate the distance traveled by Matteo. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students over 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
     \[
     1500 - 375 = 1125
     \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     \frac{1500}{2} = 750
     \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students under 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
     \[
     1500 - 750 = 750
     \]

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - Sum the female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old:
     \[
     1125 + 750 = 1875
     \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[
\boxed{1875}

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.6055 \]
So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.6055 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours. This means that after the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.6055 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.6055 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.8174 \]
So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.6055 \times 0.8174 \approx C \times 0.4947 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ C \times 0.4947 = 0.28 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.4947} \approx 0.566 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.566 \) or 56.6%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56.6\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.
3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.**

The cost of the car is $10000. Therefore, 20% of $10000 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2000.

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \times 40 + 15 \times 40 = 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, Janet earns $1000 per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000.**

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits he has already bought, he has:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs of sweets for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[
2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces}
\]

Subtracting the pieces Anne kept from the total, we find out how many pieces she gave to her friends:

\[
900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[
\frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend}
\]

Thus, each of her friends received:

\[
\boxed{78}

"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% annually, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value of the price.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums dedicated to selfies and 2 albums dedicated to portraits. Let's denote the number of selfies as \( S \) and the number of portraits as \( P \).

Since the total number of pictures is 72 and the total number of albums is 8, we can write the equation:
\[ S + P = 72 \]

We also know that the 3 albums dedicated to selfies and the 2 albums dedicated to portraits account for all 8 albums:
\[ S + P = 8 \]

However, this equation is not correct because it does not account for the fact that the remaining 3 albums (which are not selfies or portraits) are not specified in the problem. Instead, we can use the total number of pictures to find the number of selfies and portraits. Since the 3 albums dedicated to selfies and the 2 albums dedicated to portraits account for 5 albums, the remaining 3 albums must contain the rest of the pictures.

Let's denote the number of pictures in the remaining 3 albums as \( R \). Then we have:

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Given that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We can do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

1. **Early Checkouts:**
   - 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests remaining: \( 100 - 24 = 76 \).

2. **Late Checkouts:**
   - 15 guests checked out late.
   - Guests remaining: \( 76 - 15 = 61 \).

3. **Guests Checking In:**
   - Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of guests who checked in: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \).
   - Guests after new arrivals: \( 61 + 30 = 91 \).

4. **Additional Guests:**
   - 7 more guests checked in after dinner was served.
   - Final number of guests: \( 91 + 7 = 98 \).

Thus, the hotel now has \(\boxed{98}\) guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John picks, we need to calculate the number of bananas picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."

1. **Calculate the number of easy questions:**
   - Total questions: 60
   - Easy questions: 40% of 60
   \[
   \text{Easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of average and difficult questions:**
   - Total questions: 60
   - Easy questions: 24
   - Average and difficult questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
   \[
   \text{Average questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of easy questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{number of large stuffed animals sold} \times \text{price of a large stuffed animal}) + (\text{number of small stuffed animals sold} \times \text{price of a small stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:

\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Add this to the 12 pounds: \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a day:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day:**
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of dwarves: \( 40 \times 18 = 720 \) pounds per day.

4. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of days: \( 720 \times 30 = 21600 \) pounds.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the proportionality between the number of sandwiches and the price. Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( P \).

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package (8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can find \( P \) by multiplying the number of sandwiches in the third package by the price per sandwich:
\[
P = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses this amount to pay part of the new bedroom set. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find the monthly payment, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Thus, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. The number of burst red balloons is:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released. Sally initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she accidentally released half of them. The number of released yellow balloons is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. The number of blue balloons she added is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, the number of blue balloons remaining is:
\[ 8 - 6 = 2 \]

Now, we sum up all the remaining balloons Sally carried into the school:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 2 \text{ (blue)} = 23 \]

Therefore, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in the homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework in each scenario:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80
  - Probability of having to turn in the homework: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.80

Next, we combine the probabilities of each scenario:

- Probability of having to turn in the homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario: 80% or 0.80

Total probability of having to turn in the homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.80 = 1.30 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 100%, we need to normalize this probability by dividing by the sum of the individual probabilities (which is 1 in this case):

\[ \text{Normalized Probability} = \frac{1.30}{1} = 1.30 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 130\% \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, the correct interpretation is that the chance is 100%, as the scenarios cover all possibilities.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950 and for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. This is done by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ medium-sized beans}}{1 \text{ medium-sized bean}} \times 3 \text{ small beans} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's determine her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out her net earnings after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is given by the total width divided by the spacing between bottles:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The time to go from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Since there are 7 intervals, the total time is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 7 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds.

\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18
\]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese Amor buys.

\[
\text{Total cost of cheese} = \$22 + \$18 = \$40
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he received $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. However, he also lost the opportunity to earn $50,000 per year during his 4 years of college. Therefore, the total income he lost is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

So, the total amount of money he lost is the sum of the money he would have earned if he had not gone to college and the money he lost during his college years:

\[ \$100,000 + \$200,000 = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn back the $300,000. His new income after college is $75,000 per year. Therefore, the number of years required to earn back the $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. **Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:**
   - Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
   - Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

2. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area = Length × Width = \( 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \)

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

3. **Total area of fabric needed:**
   - Total area = \( 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \)

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice the amount he lost is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Therefore, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.**

There are 3 weeks of work, and each week has 7 days. Therefore, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.**

Each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all painters in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/painter/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ painters} = \frac{63}{2} \text{ hours} = 31.5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.**

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{31.5 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the number of hours of work each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{7.875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms again:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, Rory retrieved \(\boxed{10}\) tennis balls in the first set."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year to the initial price of $20,000 for the three years from 2007 to 2010.

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( t \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ P = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:
\[ P = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

   \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much distance Bernice still needs to cover, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

\[
\text{Distance still needed} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Distance still needed} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km}
\]

\[
\text{Distance still needed} = 1630 \text{ km}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

First, we calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:** 120 people.
2. **First stop:** 20 more people board the train.
   - New number of people: \( 120 + 20 = 140 \) people.
3. **Second stop:** 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \)) board the train.
   - People disembarking: 50.
   - People boarding: 100.
   - New number of people: \( 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \) people.
4. **Third stop:** 80 more people disembark.
   - New number of people: \( 190 - 80 = 110 \) people.

Thus, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank Top**: $10
2. **Running Shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis Shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic Socks**: The original price is $8, and she had a $2 coupon, so the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Tank Top} + \text{Running Shorts} + \text{Tennis Shoes} + \text{Athletic Socks}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1 ft by 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \, \text{tiles} \times \$12 \, \text{per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2400 \]"
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost of the insurance is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we can calculate the increased cost as follows:

\[ \text{Increased cost} = \text{Normal cost} + (\text{Normal cost} \times 60\%) \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 + (120 \times 0.60) \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 + 72 \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 192 \]

So, the monthly cost of the insurance after the accident is $192.

To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual cost} = \text{Increased monthly cost} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's establish the number of sheets Greg needs to wash each week:
- A twin bed requires 2 sets of sheets (one for the top and one for the bottom).
- A king size bed requires 1 set of sheets.

Greg has:
- 4 twin beds, which means he needs 4 * 2 = 8 twin sets of sheets.
- 1 king size bed, which means he needs 1 * 1 = 1 king set of sheets.

So, in total, Greg needs to wash:
\[ 8 \text{ twin sets} + 1 \text{ king set} = 9 \text{ sets of sheets per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he does each week. The laundry machine can handle:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
- 1 king set of sheets at a time.

Since he needs to wash 8 twin sets and 1 king set per week, he will need to do:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} + \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 4 \text{ loads} + 1 \text{ load} = 5 \text{ loads per week} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of loads Greg does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ 5 \text{ loads per week} \times 52 \text{ weeks per year} = 260 \text{ loads per year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   They watch 4 movies on Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma feeds her cats per day:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

So, the total amount of cat food per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Silvia ate. The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time taken for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \, part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the charges for the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. Therefore, the cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James does not respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require any response, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

This means that the number of emails James responds to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[
\text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas}
\]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[
\text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8
\]

Now, we add the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]
This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]
Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.

So, the total amount of butter required is:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- For the first 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the next 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the last 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.

The cost per pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost for each 2-pound segment is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to purchase 3 segments of 2 pounds each:
\[ 3 \text{ segments} \times \$8.00 \text{ per segment} = \$24.00 \]

Thus, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the movie theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. 

To find the additional fee, we calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The additional fee for these 21 guests is:

- Additional fee = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the additional fee to get the total cost:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so the amount she spent is \( \frac{1}{4}M \). Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M \]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, so the amount she spent is \( \frac{1}{3}R \). Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R \]

Since both Maggie and Riza initially had $60, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the remaining money for each:
\[ \text{Maggie's remaining money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \]
\[ \text{Riza's remaining money} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

Adding the remaining money of Maggie and Riza together, we get:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens of roses Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \left\lceil \frac{15}{12} \right\rceil = 2 \text{ dozens} \]
The cost for 2 dozens of roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny has $25, she needs an additional $5. This means she will receive $5 in change. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:
\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes sold: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total revenue from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Revenue from burger platters:**
   - Number of burger platters sold: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total revenue from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Revenue from sodas:**
   - Number of sodas sold: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total revenue from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum the revenues from all the items:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - Departure time: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time.
   - Time stayed in the station: \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Arrival time: 60 minutes + 5 minutes = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Departure time: 65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Arrival time: 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Departure time: 125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes.
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine the time Paul will wait for his train. Since Paul's train (the fourth train) arrives at 145 minutes, we need to find out how long he has to wait from the moment he arrives at the station until the fourth train arrives.

Since Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait for 145 minutes until the fourth train arrives.

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is:
\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. The number of additional toothpicks she needs to save is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If Melanie continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of additional weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks is:

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch was $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
\]

The discount percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[
\boxed{10\%}

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation for 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so:
\[ B = 90 \]

Frankie's score, \( F \), is described as 15 points more than twice Binkie's score. This can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Now, substitute Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Calculate the value:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down James' journey into segments and calculate the time taken for each segment.

1. **First Segment (Going to the Store):**
   - Distance: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time taken: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \)

2. **Second Segment (Returning Home):**
   - Distance: 4 miles (the distance from the halfway point back to home)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time taken: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \)

3. **Total Time:**

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store and return home is 2 hours. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she buys the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she buys the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

The total amount of fence between them is 100 feet, so we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the growth over 13 years at this rate. We multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John attends each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John attends \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John attends 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday combined.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - He spends 1600 minutes in class and 100 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes learning each week.

6. **Convert the total minutes spent learning into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, he spends \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 10}{60 \div 10} = \frac{170}{6} = 28.3333\) hours learning each week.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of meat.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of meat.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms of meat.

From the information given, we can set up the following equation to represent the amount of meat left after the Tyrannosaurus rex and the velociraptors:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:

\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 6 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 8. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{25\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train.
   - Therefore, the speed of the second train is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - For the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - For the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \text{ miles} \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.

\[ \text{Days Billy works} = 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day for 40 days.

\[ \text{Total hours} = 40 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people he helps.**

Billy can help 2 people per hour.

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two quantities.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

Finally, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to get the total number of people inside the church.

Let's perform the calculations:

\[
12 \times 35 = 420
\]
\[
20 \times 3 = 60

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of descent: 60 feet/minute

The time \( t_1 \) to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_1 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
\[
t_1 = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of descent: 80 feet/minute

The time \( t_2 \) to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_2 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
\[
t_2 = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = t_1 - t_2
\]
\[
\text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to first calculate the total time spent on lunches and breaks per day, and then multiply that by 5.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long. So, the total time spent on breaks per day is:
\[ 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the lunch time to the break time gives:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find out the total time spent on lunches and breaks over 5 days, we multiply the daily total by 5:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the credit card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the credit card:

\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are given that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough money for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \) dollars.

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:
- She needs to save $40,000 per year for 20 years.
- Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Thus, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough money for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:

   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Therefore, each of the final cut parts is 5 centimeters long.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the mean of the heights of the heels worn by the women at the party. 

Given:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels.

First, we calculate the total height of all the heels combined:
- Total height from the 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Total height from the 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we find the combined total height:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

Then, we determine the number of heels:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Number of heels}} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.
5. Find the difference between the required daily hike and the planned daily hike.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of days in June.**

June has 30 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**

Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.**

To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we divide the total number of miles by the total number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 5: Find the difference between the required daily hike and the planned daily hike.**

The difference in miles per day is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior did laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia's time was 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \( 4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \).
   - Let's denote Dior's time as \( D \). Given that \( D > 8 \text{ hours} \), we can assume a value slightly more than 8 hours for simplicity. For the sake of calculation, let's assume \( D = 10 \text{ hours} \).

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we have:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The total production rate is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The four workers work for a 10-hour shift, so the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in that time is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, we calculated that the first four workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the problem statement might have an inconsistency, but we will proceed with the given data to find the production rate of the fifth worker.

The total number of toys needed to ship the order is 400, and the first four workers produced 200 toys. Therefore, the fifth worker must produce:
\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, so the production rate of the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{20}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( L \) be Liam's current age and \( V \) be Vince's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Liam is currently 16 years old, so \( L = 16 \).
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Therefore, two years ago, Liam was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old, and Vince was \( V - 2 \) years old. According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation:
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve this equation for \( V \):
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We are given that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.5 \]

In a separate line:

\[ \boxed{12.5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk and then sum these times.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ miles} \div v \]
From this, we can solve for \( v \):
\[ v = 2 \text{ miles per minute} \div 40 \text{ minutes} = 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2 \times 0.05 \text{ miles per minute} = 0.1 \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{0.1 \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on both segments to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many more weeks Jane needs to save to reach a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has already saved.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount, given that she saves $4 per week.

First, Jane has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This can be calculated as:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 per week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Jane will need 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"

- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds
- 1 tree had 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Initially, Donny has two mugs of water: one at 33 degrees and one at \( T \) degrees. After pouring 4 ounces of the 33-degree water into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other mug, he can now drink the remaining water from both mugs.

The remaining amount of water from the 33-degree mug is \( 4 - 4 = 0 \) ounces, and the remaining amount of water from the \( T \)-degree mug is \( T - 1 \) ounces.

For Donny to be able to drink the water, the remaining water from the \( T \)-degree mug must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we have the inequality:
\[ T - 1 \geq 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 41 \]

Thus, the second bottle must be at least 41 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{41} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added:
\[ 50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ cows added} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ 20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we find the total number of animals:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after Russell orders 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:**
   Each pack costs $10.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 1 less than 3 scoops is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days and then convert that into dozens, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert total eggs to dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. If Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8 \text{ per bouquet}} = 7 \text{ bouquets}
\]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many sunflowers were sold per day from the individual sunflowers. Faraday earned $26 from the individual sunflowers per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the individual sales is:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from individual sales} = \frac{\$26}{\$2 \text{ per sunflower}} = 13 \text{ sunflowers}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the individual sales:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 84 \text{ sunflowers from bouquets} + 13 \text{ sunflowers from individual sales} = 97 \text{ sunflowers}
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 291 \text{ sunflowers}
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

\[

- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized picture scenes is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as \( P(\text{winning first ticket}) = 0.20 \).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \( P(\text{winning both tickets}) = P(\text{winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{winning second ticket}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 \).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.

   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
   \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we find \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ C + J + R = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and on weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- He eats 4 carrots each weekday.

\[
\text{Carrots eaten on weekdays} = 5 \text{ weekdays} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
- He eats 5 carrots each day on the weekend.

\[

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

According to the problem, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

   For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
   \[
   2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces:**
   Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day.

3. **Calculate the additional bottles needed:**
   The additional number of bottles required is the difference between the total number of bottles needed and the number of bottles currently produced:
   \[
   11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of babies**: 8 (identical octuplets).

2. **Dressing in colors**:
   - 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple.
   - 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue.

   Calculating the number of babies dressed in each color:
   - Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) babies.
   - Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) babies.

3. **Wearing bows**:
   - All the blue-wearers (2 babies) also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows.

   Calculating the number of purple-wearers who wear bows:
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

4. **Total number of babies wearing bows**:
   - Blue-wearers wearing bows: 2.
   - Purple-wearers wearing bows: 2.

   Total: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) babies wearing bows.

5. **Percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - Number of babies wearing bows and purple: 2.
   - Total number of babies wearing bows: 4.

   The percentage is calculated as:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( 50\% \)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Given:
- Total reports received last week = 5168
- Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
- Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

The number of reports received on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of land sold:**
   - Initially, Abraham owns 80 square meters of land.
   - He sold half of the land: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After a month, he sold another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his remaining land: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) square meters.
   - Therefore, the total area sold is \( 40 + 10 = 50 \) square meters.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the first sale:**
   - He sold 40 square meters for $50.
   - Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \times 50 = 2000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the revenue from the second sale:**
   - He sold 10 square meters for $30.
   - Revenue from the second sale: \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the remaining land and its sale price:**
   - Total land sold: 50 square meters.
   - Remaining land: \( 80 - 50 = 30 \) square meters.
   - He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - Revenue from the remaining land: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from the first sale + Revenue from the second sale + Revenue from the remaining land.
   - Total revenue: \( 2000 + 300 + 90 = 2390 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \(\boxed{2390}\) dollars."
"To find Geb's age, we first need to determine half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\) years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = \(13 - 10 = 3\) years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use \(6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs that Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, Cole hid 36 eggs in the yard.

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2350}\)."

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substituting \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \( R_r \) and the amount given to Ronnie as \( R_n \). According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so we have:

\[ R_r = 3R_n \]

Ronnie was given $5, so:

\[ R_n = 5 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Rissa was given is:

\[ R_r = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So, we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

From this, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister:

\[ R_n - x = 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

It is also given that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values and relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, we know the total area of the house is the sum of the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house. The remaining area is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \, \text{square feet} + 1200 \, \text{square feet} + 1000 \, \text{square feet} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find out how many puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box of dishwasher pods for $1, given that each pod costs $0.12 and the new box contains 20% more pods than the original box.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The original box has 100 pods and the new box has 20% more pods. Therefore, the number of pods in the new box is:

\[ 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cycles can be run with $1. Since each pod costs $0.12, the number of pods that can be bought with $1 is:

\[ \frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \text{ pods} \]

Since we can only use whole pods, we can run 8 cycles with $1. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples the remaining amount of money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, the total amount becomes:

\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money into $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Determine the amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The total chalk used on Monday is 45% of 5 inches.
   - Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is \( 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The initial chalk was 5 inches.
   - After using 2.25 inches, the remaining chalk is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Determine the amount of chalk used each subsequent day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of days the teacher can continue using 20% of the remaining chalk.

4. **Set up the equation for the remaining chalk after \( x \) days:**
   - Each day, the remaining chalk is reduced by 20%.
   - After \( x \) days, the remaining chalk can be expressed as:
     \[
     2.75 \times (1 - 0.20)^x = 2.75 \times (0.80)^x
     \]
   - We need to find \( x \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches (the threshold for recycling).

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   2.75 \times (0.80)^x < 2
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 2.75:
     \[
     (0.80)^x < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273
     \]
   - Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
     \[
     \ln((0.80)^x) < \ln(0.7273)
     \]
   - Use the property of logarithms \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \):
     \[
     x \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.7273)
     \]
   - Since \( \ln(0.80) \) is negative, divide both sides by \( \ln(0.80) \) and reverse the inequality:
     \[
     x > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.80)}
     \]
   - Calculate the values:
     \[
     \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.3105 \quad \text{and} \quad \ln(0.80) \approx -0.2231
     \]
     \[
     x > \frac{-0.3105}{-0.2231} \approx 1.39
     \]
   - Since \( x \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
     \[
     x = 2
     \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

Given:
- Number of boys = 12
- Number of girls = 12

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity.

Total number of students:
\[ \text{Total students} = 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

Number of students on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of students on varsity} = 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students} \]

Number of students not on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 \text{ total students} - 7 \text{ students on varsity} = 17 \]

\[ J = 3M + 2 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation:
\[ J = 3(5) + 2 \]
\[ J = 15 + 2 \]
\[ J = 17 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James has 30 teeth in total.

The dentist drills 4 teeth.
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
\[4 + 11 = 15\]

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substituting the numbers we have:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned due to expiry.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. Therefore, the amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600
\]

Thus, the refund amount is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Rearrange the terms to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \). To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
And check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]
Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per $500:

\[
\text{Number of books per $500} = 100
\]

Next, we need to find out how many $500 units are in $27,000:

\[
\text{Number of $500 units in $27,000} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy with $27,000 is:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Bob distributes the $27,000 among 3 schools. Therefore, the number of books he can buy per school is:

\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the number of apples Newton brought home step by step.

1. **First Apple Falls:**
   - One apple fell out of the tree and landed on Newton's head.
   - Apples on the ground: 1

2. **Newton's First Action:**
   - Newton picked up the two apples (the one on his head and the one that fell).
   - He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1

3. **Second Apple Falls:**
   - The apple Newton threw into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 + 5 = 6
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1

4. **Newton's Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all the apples on the ground (6 apples) and threw one of them at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 6 - 1 = 5
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 + 5 = 6
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1 + 1 = 2

5. **Third Apple Falls:**
   - The apple Newton threw into the tree caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 5 + 6 = 11
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 6
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 2

6. **Newton's Third Action:**
   - Newton picked up all the apples on the ground (11 apples) and threw one of them at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 11 - 1 = 10
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 6 + 10 = 16
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 2 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 16.

"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the cheese pizza = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the pepperoni pizza = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and she needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total miles are:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total miles are:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's current age:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces.
2. Doxa ate 1 slice.
3. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
4. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's sum up the slices eaten by each of them:
- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 2 slices
- Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Therefore, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had 50 bandages at the start of the second day.
   - Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had 22 bandages at the start of the third day.
   - Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages.

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. However, we calculated that they had 97 bandages left. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions. Given the conditions provided, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.
- Her daily earnings are $11.25.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Weekly earnings = $67.50/week
- Number of weeks in April = 4

Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270

Additionally, Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she will receive this bonus for each of the 4 weeks:
- Weekly bonus = $10
- Number of weeks in April = 4

Total bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Finally, we add her total earnings from her hourly wage to her total bonus:
Total earnings for April = Total earnings from hourly wage + Total bonus
Total earnings for April = $270 + $40 = $310

Thus, Jen will receive a total of $310 in April."

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in a single shark. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in a shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in a whale} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in a shark} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to sum up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice this number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, reducing the total by four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of six colors is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

So, the number of colors used is 3, and the number of colors left from the makeup set is:
\[6 - 3 = 3\]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors left after these changes:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. We know that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor itself, which is 240 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles walked by all four dogs. Finally, we can determine the miles walked by the last dog.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Adding these together, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance walked by all four dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The final numerical answer is:

- Selling price of the magazines = 11/8 of the cost price

First, calculate the selling price:
\[
\text{Selling price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
\]

To simplify the calculation:
\[
\frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9 \times 8}{8} = 11 \times 9 = 99
\]

So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

Next, calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Cost price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"To determine the total number of balloons thrown, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons initially filled and then subtract the number of balloons left.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the amounts of the two medicines:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ 8 \times 56 \, \text{mL} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Thus, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the problem, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we need to find the combined capacity of both schools. We add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - The initial cost per visit is $2.
   - Over one year, the total cost is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.
   - Over 5 years, the total cost is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) dollars.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the new cost is \(2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5\) dollars per visit.
   - Over the next 3 years, the total cost for these visits is \(3 \times 5 \times 3 = 45\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost over the 8 years (5 years + 3 years) is the sum of the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is \(10 \times 3 = 30\).
2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
3. Each group of 8 students takes 45 minutes to try the escape room.

To find out how many groups of 8 students are needed to accommodate all 30 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can be accommodated in one group:

\[
\frac{30}{8} = 3.75
\]

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number, which means we need 4 groups to accommodate all 30 students.

Each group takes 45 minutes, so the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:

\[
4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is 180 minutes. Converting this into hours, we get:

\[
180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November is $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum the scores**: Add all the scores together.
2. **Count the scores**: Determine the number of scores.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Adding these step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is:

"To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we need to find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels every day without any rest days, he travels for 3 days. If we assume he travels 24 hours each day, then he travels for a total of \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in 72 hours at an average speed of 50 km/hr:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 72 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this 3600 km represents:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is \(60\%\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Grapes Madeline ate:** 6 grapes.
2. **Grapes used by her brother:** 5 times as many as Madeline, so \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. **Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother:** \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.
4. **Grapes remaining for the pies:** Let's denote the total number of grapes at the beginning as \(G\). After Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the remaining grapes are \(G - 36\).
5. **Grapes used for the pies:** The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, and they made 4 pies. So, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
6. **Equation for the remaining grapes:** The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used some are equal to the grapes used for the pies. Therefore, we have:
   \[

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate this:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total weekly cost:
\[
1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the yearly cost is the weekly cost multiplied by the number of weeks in a year:
\[
10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours since the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this result seems incorrect because it exceeds 100%. Let's recheck the calculation. The correct percentage should be:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the correct percentage of their day, on average, that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of each shelf:**
   - Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves.
   - Total capacity = capacity of the bottom shelf + capacity of the middle shelf + capacity of the middle shelf + capacity of the top shelf.
   - Total capacity = \(20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55\) books.

3. **Determine the number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - To find out how many bookcases are needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase.
   - Number of bookcases needed = \(\frac{110}{55} = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: The rest of the hats are white. Subtract the number of red and blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[

"First, let's determine the original price of the beef jerky bag and the discounted price.

The original price of the bag is $18.00.

Since the bag is $3.00 off, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks.

To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price of the bag by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Thus, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey gets 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given ratios.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

Thus, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 2 \times 8 = 4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- In these 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:
- Total number of flashlights = 20
- Total number of candles = 36
- Total number of flashlights and candles = \(20 + 36 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs in the changing room and then find the total number of items.

Given:
- There are 20 helmets.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of robots is half the number of helmets.
- The number of helmets is half the number of footballs.

Let's denote:
- The number of helmets as \( H \).
- The number of robots as \( R \).
- The number of footballs as \( F \).

From the problem statement:
\[ H = 20 \]
\[ R = \frac{H}{2} \]
\[ H = \frac{F}{2} \]

First, calculate the number of robots:
\[ R = \frac{H}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of footballs:
\[ H = \frac{F}{2} \]
\[ 20 = \frac{F}{2} \]
\[ F = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, we have:
- Number of helmets (\( H \)) = 20
- Number of robots (\( R \)) = 10
- Number of footballs (\( F \)) = 40

To find the total number of items, sum the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

Thus, the total number of items Dominick saw is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   Conor saw 50 people.

2. **Second Day:**
   The number of people on the second day was 20 more than on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Number of people on the second day} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   The number of people on the third day was twice the number on the second day.
   \[
   \text{Number of people on the third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140
   \]

4. **Average Number of People for the Remaining Days:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Total Number of People for the Remaining Days:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 20 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = 3 * 20 = 60 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = 60.

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the rate from the second 30 seconds.
   - Rate from second 30 seconds = 60 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = 4 * 60 = 240 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = 240.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate halves the rate from the third 30 seconds.
   - Rate from third 30 seconds = 240 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = 240 / 2 = 120 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = 120.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped during the initial 120 seconds:

\[ 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:

\[ \frac{120}{4} = 30 \]

Adding these to the initial popped kernels:

\[ 440 + 30 = 470 \]

"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we will break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \( 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice.

2. **Account for the extra, twice as tart lemonade:**
   - Tim's best friend Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means this gallon will also require 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the total lemon juice needed is \( 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Determine the total lemon juice from lemons:**
   - Each lemon yields 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of lemon juice, Tim needs \( 5 \text{ lemons} \).

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim needs is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then extend that to a weekly basis.

1. **Daily consumption of German Shepherds:**
   - Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
   - There are 3 German Shepherds.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for German Shepherds is:
     \[
     3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
     \]

2. **Daily consumption of Bulldogs:**
   - Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
   - There are 2 Bulldogs.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for Bulldogs is:
     \[
     2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
     \]

3. **Total daily consumption:**
   - Adding the daily consumption of German Shepherds and Bulldogs:
     \[
     15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
     \]

4. **Weekly consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is:
     \[
     21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 147 \text{ kg/week}
     \]

Thus, the Kennel house will need \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each.

First, calculate the total number of legs:
- Legs from the 2-legged animals: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- Legs from the 4-legged animals: \(15 \times 4 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[20 + 60 = 80\]

Since we need the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[80 \div 2 = 40\]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so it is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Number of pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)

Let's calculate the sum of red, orange, and yellow candies:
54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the bus travels. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs for the hotel and the bus travels:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate the number of marbles Dallas originally had:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

So, Dallas originally had 25 marbles. Since Mazie initially had 52 marbles and gave them to Dallas and Darla, we can find out how many marbles Dallas received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas originally had from the total number of marbles Mazie had:

\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

This means Dallas received 27 marbles from Mazie. Since the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is 52, the number of marbles Darla received can be found by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:

\[ 52 - 27 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig consumes in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig consumes \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \).

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs consume \( 8 \text{ pounds/pig/day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \).

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for one week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption for 7 days is \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \).

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed from the initial amount:
- The remaining feed is \( 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan wants to use the remaining $13 to buy movie tickets, and each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, the number of movie tickets he can buy is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 100 = 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, to find the total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani, we add the amounts they each spent:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's sum these amounts:

\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount given by her parents:

\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of days Josh works in a week:**
   - Josh is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - He does not work on Sunday and Wednesday.
   - Therefore, he works on \(7 - 2 = 5\) days a week.

2. **Calculate the number of cars he services in a week:**
   - Josh services 3 cars a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, he services \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cars in a week.

3. **Calculate his weekly earnings:**
   - Josh gets paid $4 per car.
   - He services 15 cars in a week.
   - Therefore, his weekly earnings are \(15 \times 4 = 60\) dollars.

4. **Calculate his earnings for 2 weeks:**
   - He earns $60 per week.
   - He works for 2 weeks.
   - Therefore, his earnings for 2 weeks are \(60 \times 2 = 120\) dollars.

"First, let's determine the initial number of cookies Randy has:

- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he ate 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie. So, the number of each type of cookie after this snack is:

- Oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
- Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
- Sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

Next, Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, the number of oatmeal cookies after lunch is:

- Oatmeal cookies: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

Then, Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, the number of sugar cookies after giving some away is:

- Sugar cookies: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

Finally, Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. So, the number of each type of cookie after baking is:

- Oatmeal cookies: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
- Chocolate chip cookies: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- Sugar cookies: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

Now, we sum up the total number of cookies Randy has after all these changes:

\[10 \text{ (oatmeal)} + 7 \text{ (chocolate chip)} + 6 \text{ (sugar)} = 23\]

So, the final number of cookies Randy has is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers. Therefore, each part of the collection contains:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \]

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half of the collection and $7 per toy for the second half. So, we calculate the earnings from each half as follows:

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both halves gives the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over the period Nate is away and then determine how long it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.

Total holes dug by the dog:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over the 14 days:
- Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate fills in 9 holes per day.

Net change in holes per day:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day (dug)} - 9 \text{ holes/day (filled)} = -3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Over 14 days, the total net change in the number of holes is:
\[ -3 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = -42 \text{ holes} \]

This means that after 14 days, the dog has dug 42 fewer holes than Nate has filled in. Therefore, the total number of holes left to be filled is:
\[ 84 \text{ holes} - 42 \text{ holes} = 42 \text{ holes} \]

Now, let's determine how long it takes for Nate to fill in the remaining 42 holes:
- Nate fills in 9 holes per day.

Number of days required to fill in 42 holes:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ holes}}{9 \text{ holes/day}} = \frac{42}{9} \approx 4.67 \text{ days} \]

Since Nate can only work in whole days, we round up to the next whole day:
\[ 4.67 \text{ days} \approx 5 \text{ days} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{14 \text{ days} + 5 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = \frac{19 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 2.71 \text{ weeks} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, it takes Nate approximately 3 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given:
- Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students.
- Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School.

First, calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School:
\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1000}

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Given:
- Total cookies made = 7995
- Rainbow cookies = 2595
- Oatmeal cookies = 3075

The number of chocolate chip cookies can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - (\text{Rainbow cookies} + \text{Oatmeal cookies}) \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - (2595 + 3075) \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 5670 \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor correctly gathered the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + 7 \text{ (beakers)} = 31 \text{ items} \]

We know that Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the tables.
2. Determine the total number of screws needed for all the legs.
3. Subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for the 4 tables:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:
\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times \text{Time Aaron took} = A \times 16 \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Therefore:
\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, the distance Vanessa ran, \( D_V \), is:
\[ D_V = 2 \times D_A = 2 \times (A \times 16) = 32A \]

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we have:
\[ D_V = 4 \]
\[ 32A = 4 \]
\[ A = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Now, we know Aaron's speed \( A = \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute. Since Vanessa's speed \( V \) is half of Aaron's speed:
\[ V = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

To find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we use her speed:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Speed of Vanessa}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line that the caretaker already has:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one reservation:
- Each meal costs $5.
- Each bottle of wine costs $5.
- Therefore, for one reservation, the total cost is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how many reservations they get in a night:
- They get 6 reservations a night.

So, the total cost for one night is:
\[ 6 \text{ reservations} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we need to calculate the total revenue for the week:
\[ 90 \text{ dollars/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 180 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"First, let's determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the current age of James. We know that James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years. Therefore, Dora's current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to determine the current age of John. We know that John had a son James when he was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. Therefore, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find the age of John's youngest son. The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Therefore, the youngest son's current age is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old} \]

In 3 years, the youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \). We know two things:

1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
