"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed: 2 bolts.
2. Determine the amount of white fiber needed: half the amount of blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.
3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber needed: the sum of the blue and white fiber. This is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) bolts.

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The problem states that the repairs and subsequent work increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house and add it to the original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase in value means the value increases by:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, Josh sells the house for its new value of $200,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost Josh incurred from the selling price:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one session (3 sprints):**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each time, the total distance for one session is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total distance for one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair up the glasses:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Restart and update installation:**
   - The download restarts after 40 minutes, and the update installation takes 20 minutes.

3. **Remaining 60% of the download:**
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - (2 hours + 0.5 hours) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
- Distance covered in the first segment: 180 miles.
- Distance covered in the third segment: 15 miles.
- Distance covered in the fourth segment: 120 miles.

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Carlos starts earning money when the net profit becomes positive. Since the net profit is $7.5 per year from the first year onward, he starts earning money immediately.

Thus, the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning money is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + $125
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,096

Next, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize his profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:

- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Thus, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{243}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is 80 jelly beans. 

\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each of the two 20-minute segments and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to 4 points.

25% of 4 points is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both segments:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games to the money he has left.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that John earned $195 from selling his lego sets. To find out how much money he spent, we subtract the money he has left from the total money he earned.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 190 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the total cost of the video games is $160, we can confirm that the remaining $30 is the money he has left.

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he has 0 lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time spent running in a week:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. To find his average speed, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that Dana's walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find the difference.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

1. Calculate the total calories you have left to consume within your daily calorie target.
2. Determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.
3. Convert the servings into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total calories left to consume.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories left} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.**

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can consume with 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 3: Convert the servings into grams.**

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving} \]

Therefore, with 0.8 servings, you can eat:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \text{ grams} \]"

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \)
   - Calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
     \]
   - Total articles on Tuesday:
     \[
     5 + 2 = 7

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled to his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance. Let's denote the distance from his starting point to the destination as \( D \) miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM at 10 miles per hour. The time taken to travel distance \( D \) at 10 mph is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After 4 PM, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time taken to travel back the same distance \( D \) at 6 mph is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time taken to travel to the destination and the time taken to return:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30:
\[ \frac{D}{10} = \frac{3D}{30} \]
\[ \frac{D}{6} = \frac{5D}{30} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance \( D \) is not specified, the final answer in terms of \( D \) is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4D}{15}} \]"

"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is \$40.

"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat has had and then sum them up.

1. **Patchy's Kittens:**
   - The problem states that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
   - The adopted kittens are 7.
   - Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kittens.

2. **Trixie's Kittens:**
   - The problem states that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Kittens:**
   - The total number of kittens is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie.
   - Adopted kittens: 7
   - Patchy's kittens: 21
   - Trixie's kittens: 12

   \[
   \text{Bridge's weight limit} = 5000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Identify the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the driver and empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the weight of each box:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of each box} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \right\rfloor
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

7. **Since the result is an integer, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = 83
   \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

"To determine the number of good oranges, we need to first understand the distribution of the oranges in the basket.

1. **Total Oranges**: 25
2. **Bad Oranges**: 1
3. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of 25
4. **Sour Oranges**: 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Next, we know the total number of oranges is 25. We can now calculate the number of good oranges by subtracting the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = \text{Total Oranges} - (\text{Bad Oranges} + \text{Unripe Oranges} + \text{Sour Oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) \]
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = 25 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Good Oranges} = 17 \]

Thus, the number of good oranges is:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000.
   - The total pension for the first 20 years is calculated as:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $50,000:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension after 30 years is the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the next 10 years:
     \[
     1,000,000 + 2,500 = 1,002,500
     \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be the pension she receives in the 31st year, which is the 5% of the value of the pension at the start of the 21st year, which is $2,500.

Thus, the annual pension after 30 years is:

   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The total cost for the first half is calculated as:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half.
   - The reduced monthly charge is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The total cost for the second half is calculated as:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Adding the costs from both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from both weekdays and Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in one week (5 weekdays) is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from one weekday are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Since she teaches 5 weekdays, her total earnings from weekdays are:
\[ \$5625.00 \times 5 = \$28125.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, determine the number of days left in the first year after the first 180 days:
\[ 365 \text{ days/year} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

Now, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Add the amounts of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, and then find the difference between the amounts of laundry Raymond and David do.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Laundry done by Raymond} - \text{Laundry done by David} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

The better price is buying the flowers in packages of 2 for $9.00. Therefore, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:

"First, we need to determine how much water each of the two girls received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

So, each girl received 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we account for the 6 liters of water that the boy received. The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. After the girls and the boy have taken their portions, the amount of water left is:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 8 \text{ liters} - 6 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the number of liters of water left is:

\[
\boxed{10}

\[ 54 - 37 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

To find Alex's weight, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we need to find their combined weights. We add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Therefore, their combined weights are 623 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 623 \]"

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost (\( L = 7 \)), we can find the number of games they won (\( W \)):
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed in the company for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed 5 years of service, she qualifies for the 10% increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After 5 Years**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} + \text{Increase} = 600 + 60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for Each of the Next Three Years**:
   - After the first additional year (6 years total), the salary increases by 10% of $660.
   - After the second additional year (7 years total), the salary increases by 10% of $660.
   - After the third additional year (8 years total), the salary increases by 10% of $660.

6. **Calculate the Salary Increase for Each Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase for 6th year} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary after 6 years} = 660 + 66 = \$726
   \]

   \[
   \text{Increase for 7th year} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary after 7 years} = 726 + 72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

   \[
   \text{Increase for 8th year} = 10\% \text{ of } \$798.60 = 0.10 \times 798.60 = \$79.86
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary after 8 years} = 798.60 + 79.86 = \$878.46
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service (a total of 8 years) is \(\boxed{878.46}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8000 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:
\[ \text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Since Cindy has 4 pets, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   We sum the number of pets each person has:
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Pets Jan has} + \text{Pets Marcia has} + \text{Pets Cindy has} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:

"To determine Jackson's age, we will use the information provided and set up equations based on the relationships between the ages of the children.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James's age: \( H \)

From the problem, we know:
1. James is 10 years old: \( H = 10 \)
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( H = C - 1 \)
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)

First, we substitute the value of \( H \) into the second equation:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now we know Corey's age is 11. Next, we use the fourth equation to find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

We now have Amy's age, and we can use the first equation to find Jackson's age. We know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
Substituting Amy's age:
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Use Lee's original time to find Gerald's original time.
3. Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:

\[ 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means that Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of his original time. So, we calculate Gerald's new time as follows:

\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats in the neighborhood and then find the total number of pets.

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know that there are two cats for every dog.
   - Given that the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
   - First, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
     \[
     \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
     \]
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats:
     \[
     \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of rabbits} + \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 168 + 60 + 120 = 348

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.
2. Calculate the number of girls who are in the girl scout.
3. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

**Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls.**

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of girls who are in the girl scout.**

According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout.**

The number of girls not in the girl scout is the total number of girls minus the number of girls in the girl scout:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   \[
   \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume of tomatoes to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces, we divide 64 by 16:
   \[
   \text{Number of 16-ounce cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   \[

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her fruit roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups she has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- His fruit roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups he has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

Since they both ate their entire amount, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

"First, we need to determine how many seconds it took Julia to row 64 seconds away from the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate of her rowing:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to determine how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - According to the problem, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - According to the problem, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Cost per board: $10
- Total cost for 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = \$100 \)

For the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Cost per board: $16
- Total cost for 5 boards: \( 5 \times 16 = \$80 \)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber.

For the 10 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Selling price per board: Let's assume the selling price is the same as the cost, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = \$100 \)

For the 5 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Selling price per board: Let's assume the selling price is the same as the cost, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 5 boards: \( 5 \times 16 = \$80 \)

The total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts is sugar. Since sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\).

We can now calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total amount of sugar and water by the fraction that represents the sugar:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 120 \times \frac{7}{20}
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
120 \times \frac{7}{20} = 120 \times 0.35 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.**

Initially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.**

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.**

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary is given as $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so each patient is seen for \(\frac{24}{60} = 0.4\) hours per visit.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour per patient, so the revenue per patient is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total revenue from 500 patients is \(500 \times 80 = 40,000\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost to the hospital:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the cost per patient is \(0.4 \times 150 = 60\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost from 500 patients is \(500 \times 60 = 30,000\) dollars.

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \]

So, the hospital's profit from these visits is \(\boxed{10000}\)."

- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the first test is:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
- The second test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the second test is:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

Thus, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs (\( B = 12 \)), we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of pink gumballs (\( P \)):
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

First, calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much money he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he spends playing video games in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, the total amount of money he would earn in one week if he worked those 14 hours is:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost including tax, we first need to identify which items are considered nonfood items and then calculate the tax on those items. The items that are considered nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps.

1. Calculate the cost of nonfood items before tax:
   - Light bulbs: $3
   - Roach traps: $4
   Total cost of nonfood items before tax = $3 + $4 = $7

2. Calculate the tax on the nonfood items:
   - Tax rate: 10%
   - Tax amount = 10% of $7 = 0.10 * $7 = $0.70

3. Calculate the total cost of nonfood items including tax:
   - Total cost of nonfood items including tax = $7 + $0.70 = $7.70

4. Calculate the cost of food items:
   - Milk: $2
   - Eggs: $3
   - Cups: $3
   Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 = $8

5. Calculate the total cost including tax:
   - Total cost of nonfood items including tax: $7.70
   - Total cost of food items: $8
   - Total cost including tax = $7.70 + $8 = $15.70

The final numerical answer is $15.70."
"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Next, we calculate the total income from these clients. Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

Now, we calculate the total expenses. Each client requires:
- 2 bottles of bleach
- 1 pack of cloths

The cost of bleach per bottle is $2, and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the cost per client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since there are 8 clients, the total expenses are:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Finally, the profit is the difference between the total income and the total expenses:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Thus, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest per hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total number of hectares John has.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since John harvests every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of harvests per year as follows:
\[ \text{Number of harvests per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year:
\[ \text{Pineapples per hectare per year} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Now, we need to find out the total number of pineapples harvested from all 10 hectares:
\[ \text{Total pineapples per year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and then sum them up.

1. The first lego box has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego box has 3 times more pieces than the first box. Therefore, the number of pieces in the second box is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. The third lego box has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first box. Therefore, the number of pieces in the third box is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125
   \]

Now, we sum the pieces from all three boxes:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Thus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}
\]"
"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, she sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave as she saw leave in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there are 0 bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave, so the hive has 0 bees. After the next 6 hours, 15 bees return, so the hive has:
   \[
   0 + 15 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Then, 60 bees leave, so the hive has:
   \[
   15 - 60 = -45 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Since the number of bees cannot be negative, this indicates that the hive is empty and no bees can leave. Therefore, the hive has 0 bees after the 60 bees leave.

5. **Bee population in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. Since 60 bees left in the previous 6 hours, all 60 bees return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   60
   \]

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of a child ticket is $10.

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine who will finish the race first and by how much time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from school to their respective homes.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2.50 + \$2.25 + \$0.25 = \$5.00. \]

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( x - 20 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants then ate the last remaining french fry, leaving 5 fries. So, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \implies x - 20 = 15 \implies x = 35
\]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{35} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To determine the total length of all the baked goods in feet, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Total length of rolls = \( 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \).

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Total length of croissants = \( 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \).

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \( 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
- Total length of baguettes = \( 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \).

Now, we sum the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
- Total length in inches = \( 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \).

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the total length in feet is \( \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \).

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."

"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate step by step.

1. **Monday's Water Depth:**
   The depth of the water on Monday is given as 17 feet.

2. **Tuesday's Water Depth:**
   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Water Depth:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months. 
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Each price increase is by 120% of the previous price. This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by 1.20. 

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**: If the initial price is \( P_0 \), after \( n \) increases, the price \( P_n \) is given by:
   \[
   P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n
   \]

6. **Applying the Formula**: Here, \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \):
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

7. **Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

8. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

\[

"To determine the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - Total value of red cars = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total value of action figures = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost of 3 action figures = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we sum up the values of all the toys:
- Total value of red cars = $20
- Total value of action figures = $15
- Total value of the doll = $15

Total value of all toys = \( 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age \( S \):
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird based on the information provided.

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's Age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's Age**: The same as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's Age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's Age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

1. Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, convert the time to peel one potato to seconds:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 90 \text{ seconds/potato} = 5400 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, add the total time to peel and the total time to cut to find the overall time:
\[ 5400 \text{ seconds} + 300 \text{ seconds} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Convert the total time back to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the revenue per gallon minus the cost per gallon:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the given information:
- Zaid's monthly salary: $6000
- Rent: \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary
- Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary
- Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel
- Amount given to daughter: $200
- Amount given to wife: $700

First, calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
\]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
\]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
\]

Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
\]

Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
\]

Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of crabs Monic has.
2. Determine the number of crabs Rani has.
3. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Monic has} = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Next, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
\]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[
\text{Total number of crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by Team 1 is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team 2 is the sum of these times:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time
To find out by how many seconds Team 1 wins, we subtract the total time taken by Team 1 from the total time taken by Team 2:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then expressed as a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even on first roll and even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

The percentage increase is:
\[
\left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we start by identifying the number of apples each person picked.

1. We know that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.
2. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. To find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother, we add the number of apples each picked:
   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30
   \]

Thus, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:
\[ \text{Number of rats} = \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \text{Number of rats in each cage} = \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

1. **Original Amount Owed**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02 (as a decimal)
3. **Number of Months**: 3

First, calculate the total interest accrued over 3 months:
\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Original Amount} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Months}
\]
\[
\text{Total Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 = 6
\]

Next, add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[
\text{Total Amount to Pay} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount to Pay} = 100 + 6 = 106
\]

Thus, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the number of bags the trader sold is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets} = \$20.25 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides. They went on 2 rides, each costing $33:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66 \]

Next, we find the total expenses by summing the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 + \$66 = \$102 \]

Since there are three friends, we divide the total expenses by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
\[ \text{Amount each friend paid} = \frac{\$102}{3} = \$34 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

First, we need to find the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches. Since he collects peaches for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the total number of peaches John collects is:

"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. There are 7 days in a week, so the amount of insects needed per day for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, since there are ten ducks in the flock, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds/day/duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.**

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees after 10 years.**

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.**

30% of the trees die, so 70% of the trees remain. Therefore, the number of trees left after 10 years is:
\[ 130 \times 0.70 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

The final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find the cost of one pen. We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of one pencil} + \text{Cost of one eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now that we know the cost of one pen is $1.50, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Thus, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00. The final numerical answer is:

The total population of Soda is 23786.
The number of men is 8417.
The number of women is 9092.

The number of children can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - (\text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women}) \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 23786 - 17509 \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 6277 \]

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards collected:**
   We sum the cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total collected:
   \[
   20 + 320 = 340
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{340}\)."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is \(\boxed{55}\) liters."
"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's original weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = Original weekly salary + Raise amount
- New weekly salary = \( 2000 + 100 = 2100 \) dollars per week.

Now, we calculate the total amount of money John made in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total annual salary = New weekly salary \(\times\) Number of weeks in a year
- Total annual salary = \( 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \) dollars.

Additionally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000:
- Total annual earnings = Total annual salary + One-time monetary reward
- Total annual earnings = \( 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]
So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let's denote this score by \( x \). The sum of the six test scores will be:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then sum these weights.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is:

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after considering her initial savings.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional money she needs to earn is \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation:
\[4x = 60\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{60}{4} = 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total number of eggs:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know his walking speed is 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
   - The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Determine the total number of customers over the first two days.
   - The total number of customers on the first two days is \(100 + 150 = 250\).

4. Calculate the number of customers on the third day.
   - The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amounts of water in the pools are related by the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
Rearranging terms to solve for \( S \):
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup and calculations. The correct interpretation should be that the small pool has \( S \) gallons and the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons. The leak rate affects the current amounts, but the relationship between the current amounts should still hold. Let's substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since her hourly wage is $8.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses five empty pens to make one new pen, he reduces the number of empty pens by 4 (since he uses 5 pens and gets 1 new pen).

Let's break down the process step by step:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After the first round of mixing, he uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Now he has 20 pens (25 - 5 + 1 = 21 pens).
- After the second round, he uses another 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Now he has 16 pens (21 - 5 + 1 = 17 pens).
- After the third round, he uses another 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Now he has 12 pens (17 - 5 + 1 = 13 pens).
- After the fourth round, he uses another 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Now he has 8 pens (13 - 5 + 1 = 9 pens).
- After the fifth round, he uses another 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Now he has 4 pens (9 - 5 + 1 = 5 pens).
- After the sixth round, he uses another 5 pens to make 1 new pen. Now he has 0 pens (5 - 5 + 1 = 1 pen).

At this point, Ram has 1 pen left, and he can no longer make a new pen because he doesn't have enough empty pens to mix. However, he can use the last pen to make one more pen, but since he only has 1 pen left, he can only make 1 more pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram can have is the initial 25 pens plus the 6 new pens he made:

\[ 25 + 6 = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[
\boxed{31}

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's allowance:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20.

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32. Therefore, the difference in the number of snails is:

\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

This difference is also given to be twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we calculate the total cost after the discount.

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."

Thus, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the onions the chef bought. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday and Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.
4. Find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:
- Sue's sister ate \( 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \( 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \) cookies in total.
- Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue's sister consumed \( 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \) calories.
- Sue consumed \( 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 5040 - 1520 = 3520 \]

So, Sue consumed 3520 more calories than her sister. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3520}

1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Determine the number of boys and girls in the school.
3. Find out how many girls are in the third class.
4. Calculate the number of boys in the third class.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.**

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes.
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of boys and girls in the school.**

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

**Step 3: Find out how many girls are in the third class.**

We know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
\[ \text{Girls in the first class} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Girls in the second class} = 12 \]

The total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ \text{Girls in the third class} = 30 - 27 = 3 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of boys in the third class.**

Since the total number of students in the third class is 20 and there are 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night = 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so he killed \( 3c \) wolves.
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars today.
   - Therefore, \( c = 12 \).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Total animals killed last night = 25.
   - Total animals killed today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.
   - Total animals killed = 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals.

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[
\boxed{84}

"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

"Let's define the variables for the number of apples and bananas Jamal has:

- Let \( A_J \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( B_J \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_A = A_J + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_A = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( B_J = A_J + 4 \).

First, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_A = A_J + 8 \]
\[ 52 = A_J + 8 \]
\[ A_J = 52 - 8 \]
\[ A_J = 44 \]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ B_J = A_J + 4 \]
\[ B_J = 44 + 4 \]
\[ B_J = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ B_A = \frac{1}{2} B_J \]
\[ B_A = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ B_A = 24 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_A + B_A + A_J + B_J \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 168."

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of stitches remaining for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stitches per sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{765}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

\[
\text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = 20 \times 40 = \$800
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

\[
\text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = 80 \times 30 = \$2400
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:

\[
\boxed{3200}
\]"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   - Sum the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.
     \[
     54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \text{ lines}
     \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

We then find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we determine how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them by subtracting the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of hole separately and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time taken to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Time to dig 30 small holes = \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes

Next, we calculate the time taken to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Time to dig 15 large holes = \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes

Now, we sum the time taken for both types of holes:
- Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \)

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."
"Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( C \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20. This can be written as:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know from the initial condition that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
2. Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots.
5. Find half of the combined total number of spots.

Step 1: Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
A cobra has 70 spots, and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:
\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:
\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:
\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Step 4: Find the combined total number of spots.
The combined total number of spots is the sum of the spots of all the cobras and all the mambas:
\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Step 5: Find half of the combined total number of spots.
Half of the combined total number of spots is:
\[ \text{Half of combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \).

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each person over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

\[ \text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Thus, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents. We subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles.

First, we know the speed of the car in the fast lane is 60 miles/hour. The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. We can calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:
\[ \text{Speed}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Now, we need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles. Using the same formula for time:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the number of medals Ali has as \( A \) and the number of medals Izzy has as \( I \). According to the problem, Ali has 22 medals, so \( A = 22 \). Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so \( I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \).

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is \( A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \). The problem states that this total is 10 times less than the number of medals given out, which means the number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 10 \times (A + I) = 10 \times 39 = 390 \).

"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will get:

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is \(3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).
3. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in minutes is \(2.5 \times 60 = 150 \text{ minutes}\).
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10: \(150 \div 10 = 15\).
5. Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are \(15 \times 5 = 75\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the fourth round: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the fourth round: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the fourth round: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members of the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Assuming the household eats rice every lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Monday: Closed
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Friday: Closed
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: 20 crates

Next, we sum the crates sold on the days he was open:
\[ 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} + 20 \text{ (Saturday)} + 20 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was \( 35 \) crates off from his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Round trip distance: \(30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}\)
   - Miles driven per day: 60 miles
   - Days per week: 5 days
   - Weeks per year: 50 weeks
   - Total miles driven in a year: \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\)

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: \(15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year}\)

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Months per year: 12 months
   - Total bonus per year: \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\)

4. **Calculate the total amount John pays a year for driving:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $30,000
   - Total bonus: $1,800
   - Total payment per year: \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}\)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

The combined time for Monday and Sunday is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages (2 pages on the front and 2 pages on the back).

2. **Number of Pages**: A 32-page tabloid means there are 32 pages to be printed.

3. **Calculating the Number of Pieces of Paper**: Since each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can print:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Next, we add the $10 she spent on rides:

\[
25 + 10 = 35
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she brought:

\[
50 - 35 = 15
\]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books, so the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
3. The number of books sold this year is 45.
4. The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number of books sold this year, so it is \(2 \times 45 = 90\).
5. The total number of books sold in the first and second years is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
6. The number of books sold in the third year is \(200 - 135 = 65\).

Each book sells for $20. Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 900 \]"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April if the company performed very well for the whole month is:

"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
2. Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we have:
\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

Next, we determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:
\[
\text{Loaves remaining} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as follows:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks required for Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 extra arms grow in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, 3 extra legs grow in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
   \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts, we subtract the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the amount he can spend on the trip:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the three people who eat 3 eggs each:**
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the two people who eat 2 eggs each:**
   \[
   2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the family:**
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   \[
   13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is 32 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was \(P / 2 = 60000\).

5. **Solve for the current population \(P\):**
   \[
   P / 2 = 60000 \implies P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Therefore, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people with previous commitments is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\) people.

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\) people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store initially had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the 20 marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:

\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of Boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of Boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total Number of Children} = \text{Number of Boys} + \text{Number of Girls} + \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial total number of people at the party.
2. Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.
3. Determine the number of men and women who left.
4. Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.

**Step 1: Determine the initial total number of people at the party.**

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women. So, the total number of people at the beginning is:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people who left after an hour.**

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of men and women who left.**

Let \( m \) be the number of men who left and \( w \) be the number of women who left. We know that the total number of people who left is 10, so:
\[ m + w = 10 \]

We also know that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of men who left is:
\[ m = 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Using the equation \( m + w = 10 \), we can find \( w \):
\[ 3 + w = 10 \]
\[ w = 7 \]

So, 7 women left the party.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of women who stayed at the party.**

Initially, there were 15 women. Since 7 women left, the number of women who stayed is:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the cost of the pen is $1. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has in total.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of pencils Jam has as:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together, we add their individual totals:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the two effects separately: the cooling effect and the addition of cream.

1. **Cooling Effect:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters.

2. **Addition of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The addition of cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening due to the cooling and the weakening due to the cream:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the exchange rate and the outcome of the trades.

Given:
- 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
- 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since each 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the number of new records that can be obtained from \( x \) old records is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

We know that the total number of new records obtained is 7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
x = 7 \times 2
\]
\[
x = 14
\]

Thus, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of junior and senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the monthly salary of each senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required.

The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which means it needs to charge an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points.

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

"To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.
3. Calculate the discount from the coupon.
4. Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
\]

The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip. Since they earned 4 rewards, they used 4 rewards. Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase.

**Step 3: Calculate the discount from the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the discount from the coupon is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.**

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. After using the rewards, the price becomes:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, applying the coupon, the final price is:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

### Job A:
1. **Gross Pay**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **State Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

### Job B:
1. **Gross Pay**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Pay Before Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **State Tax on Net Pay**: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

### Comparison:
- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, so we have the equation:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

It is also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we have:
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

3. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
4. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the given information:
- The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.
- The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree.

First, calculate the height of the second tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

\[ \$12 \text{ (toy cars)} + \$5 \text{ (teddy bears)} = \$17 \]

Dean initially had $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of a round of mini-golf:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of one round of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

3. **Cost of riding the go-karts twice:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per go-kart ride} = \$10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost for two go-kart rides} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

4. **Total cost of all activities:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of one round of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} + \text{Cost for two go-kart rides}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$5 + \$20 = \$30
   \]

5. **Remaining budget after the activities:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

6. **Determine how many friends can be invited:**
   Each friend will get $5 in arcade tokens, so the number of friends can be calculated by dividing the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per friend}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her birthday party.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day and spends $1 on lollipops, the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Billy started with $10. If he spent all his money on candy, the total cost of the candy is $10.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy bought. The total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since Billy spent all his money on candy, we have:
   \[
   1.5x = 10
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{10}{1.5} = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine the change Billy received:**
   Billy started with $10 and spent $10 on candy, so he received $0 in change.

6. **Calculate the amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. Since he received $0 in change, he spent:
   \[
   \frac{0}{2} = 0 \text{ dollars on gumballs}
   \]

7. **Verify the number of gumballs Billy bought:**
   Billy bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. The total cost for 40 gumballs is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since the problem states that Billy bought 40 gumballs, and the cost of 40 gumballs is $2, which is consistent with the $0.05 price per gumball, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}
\]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

This fraction represents the number of days between services. To find the number of days, we need to determine how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles, which is the service interval. Since the train travels 675 miles per day, the number of days between services is:
\[\frac{18000}{675} = 26.6667 \approx 27 \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and the stuffing required for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine the total time John's trip took, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of his journey separately and then sum these times.

1. **Trip to his friend's house:**
   - Distance: 200 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = \(\frac{200}{70} = \frac{20}{7}\) hours

2. **Detour:**
   - Additional distance: 10 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = \(\frac{10}{70} = \frac{1}{7}\) hours

3. **Trip back home:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we sum the times for all segments:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{1}{7} + 3
\]

To add these times, we first convert 3 hours to a fraction with a denominator of 7:
\[
3 = \frac{21}{7}
\]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{20}{7} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 1 + 21}{7} = \frac{42}{7} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time John's trip took is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of fourth-grade boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96 and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys who were present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"Let's denote the number of girls in the park as \( G \) and the number of boys as \( B \).

According to the problem, there are 6 girls, so:
\[ G = 6 \]

It is also stated that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls, so:
\[ B = 2 \times G \]
\[ B = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ B = 12 \]

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys:
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = G + B \]
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = 6 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total number of kids} = 18 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points Jane needs to reach a total of at least 42 points. We set up the following inequality:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]
where \( x \) represents the points Jane needs to score on her third test.

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given as four times the number of customers minus 5. So, if we denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as \( S \), we have:
\[ S = 4C - 5 \]
Substituting \( C = 3 \) into the equation:
\[ S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. If we denote the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as \( V \), we have:
\[ V = 3S \]
Substituting \( S = 7 \) into the equation:
\[ V = 3(7) = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out of the Walmart is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for various reasons is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence:
\[ C + S + V = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Sara has after scoring 14 points:
\[ \text{Sara's points after scoring 14} = 8 + 14 = 22 \]

Next, since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 14 points:
\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points. Let \( x \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. Therefore:
\[ x + 14 = 66 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 66 - 14 = 52 \]

Thus, Erin had \(\boxed{52}\) points before scoring the additional 14 points."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, we calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can find the number of faulty pieces by calculating 40% of the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment by \( N \). The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces of equipment is then \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

Next, we need to find the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment. Since the total cost of all pieces of equipment is $400,000, the cost of each piece of equipment is \( \frac{400000}{N} \). Therefore, the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since the loan period is five months, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for five months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.1667\%
   \]
   The total interest for five months on a $3,650 loan is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times \frac{4.1667}{100} = 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be repaid} = 3650 + 150 = 3800
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month over five months, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together to find the total number of pesos they have:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost to buy the supplies is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. Therefore, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{1 \text{ hour}} = \$18/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can write the equation as:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:
\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:
\[
x = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets, we need to calculate the cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Therefore, the cost for David is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost for one ride is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, we find the difference in cost between Dasha's and David's expenses:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30
- The amount David saves is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

Thus, the amount of money David saves is \(\boxed{6}\)."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio. Let the number of popsicles Betty has be \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has be \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

   Adding up all the time spent:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Percentage of time spent editing:**
   To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Simplifying the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{7.5} = \frac{1.5 \div 1.5}{7.5 \div 1.5} = \frac{1}{5}

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (assuming May has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[
     6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (assuming June has 4 weeks)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with the following pricing: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she pays $3/2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The cost of the taffy is $4.50, the cost of the seashells is $6.00, and the cost of the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00. Adding these together, the total cost is $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $11.50, she would be $11.50 - $10 = -$1.50. This means Sally is $1.50 short of the amount she needs to buy all the items. Therefore, she does not have enough money to buy all the items and would be $1.50 in debt.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1.50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make to last her for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   - Shannon eats 2 cookies per night.
   - There are 30 days in the period she wants the cookies to last.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
     \]

2. **Determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs:**
   - One dozen equals 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many dozens of cookies are needed for 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 5% of the total candles are dangerous and will explode. 

First, we calculate the total number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Total dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles will also smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the total candles are dangerous and have the defect, we can calculate the number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discounted price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[
0.30 \times 20 = 6
\]
So, the discount amount is $6.

Next, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[
20 - 6 = 14
\]
Each blouse is now priced at $14 after the discount.

Misha picks out 4 blouses. To find the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses, we multiply the sale price of one blouse by 4:
\[
14 \times 4 = 56
\]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees, so \( 0 \) apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each camel has 1 head and 2 humps.
2. Each dromedary has 1 head and 1 hump.
3. The total number of heads is 180.
4. The total number of humps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:
\[ C + D = 180 \]
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 800 km.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled over the two weeks:
- Distance for the first 4 days: 800 km.
- Distance for the next 2 days: 240 km.
- Distance for the next day: 0 km.
- Distance for the second week: 2100 km.

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts given by both banks.
3. Add the total amount received from the banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we sum the amounts given by both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add this total to Mr. Josue's initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. So, the number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. The number of cats left on the rock after some ran away is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards:**
   Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   The cost of the ticket to the amusement park is $100. Since Kenny gets to go with $50, he must have made:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   Kenny sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{50 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 cards.

4. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the remaining 2/3. If he sold 33 cards, then the total number of cards he started with is:
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \frac{33}{\frac{2}{3}} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 49.5

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then use that information to find out how many candy bars he bought.

First, let's denote the amount of money George initially had as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means that the money he spent is 99% of his initial amount. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99x = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{5}{0.99} = \frac{500}{99} \approx 5.0505 \]

So, George initially had approximately $5.0505. Now, we know that he spent $5 on chips and candy bars. Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as \( y \). The cost of the chips is $0.40 per bag and the cost of each candy bar is $0.75. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

The total cost of the chips and candy bars is $5, so the cost of the candy bars is:

\[ 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 \]

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, the number of candy bars \( y \) is:

\[ y = \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since the number of candy bars must be a whole number, and considering the context of the problem, we can conclude that George bought 5 candy bars. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory cuts into pieces. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have. Since each of them has one piece, the weight of the cake they have together is:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. Adding these together gives:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater, it will take Bernadette \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes to drive to the theater.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne will take 16 minutes to drive to the theater, he will arrive at the theater 16 minutes after he leaves. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than the time Wayne will arrive.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave \(16 - 5 = 11\) minutes before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We can substitute the known values into this formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( R \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

We are also given that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A in minutes is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile:

\[ \text{Bails of hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining number of sneakers sold to the department store is:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from the 31 sneakers sold to the department store at $25 each is:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and one soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 13 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

1. **Calculate the initial cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon initially was:
     \[
     \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon:**
   - Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - With the new cost per balloon being $65, the total cost for 170 balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - Calculate \(170 \times 65\):
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

Thus, the car's average speed during the trip is \(\boxed{50}\) mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

After trading, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (since she started with 8 and traded 3). The value of these 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the total value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of apples eaten by Marin in 30 days.
2. Determine the number of apples eaten by Nancy in 30 days.
3. Add the two quantities together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

Since both Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, we can calculate the number of apples each eats in 30 days as follows:

- Marin eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).
- Nancy eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:

\[120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples}\]

So, the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for his raised beds.

Each raised bed has the following dimensions:
- Width: 2 feet
- Length: 8 feet
- Height: 2 feet

The volume \( V \) of one raised bed can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the given dimensions:
\[
V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) of soil needed is:
\[
V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) of the potting soil is:
\[
C = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[
\boxed{1920}

"To determine the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - This is:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were already there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 25 fairies. So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there.
3. Therefore, the total number of fairies after the 25 fairies joined is \(50 + 25 = 75\).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, we subtract 30 from the 75 fairies that were there.
5. The number of fairies remaining is \(75 - 30 = 45\).

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.

First, let's calculate the total number of puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
- Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, let's calculate the total number of puppies with spots:
- Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
- Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
- Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we need to find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots. The formula for percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles per week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \). We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 6

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

The length of each remora is 6 inches. Converting this to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) represents. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total number of minutes needed to break in the shoes by the total number of days he will walk.

First, we know that three weeks is equal to 21 days (since 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the shoes. He plans to walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Now, we divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days he will walk:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth (if necessary), we get:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} \approx 11.43 \]

So, Jason needs to spend approximately 11.43 minutes walking each day.

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This is given by the formula for the union of two sets:
\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in total. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To determine how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total capacity of the trays.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Jaime has from the total capacity of the trays.

First, we calculate the total capacity of the trays:
\[
\text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Capacity per tray} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs Jaime has from the total capacity:
\[
\text{Eggs that won't be placed} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Number of eggs} = 48 - 64

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = \( 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \) dollars.

2. **Apply the buy one get one free offer:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather only pays for one razor from each pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 2 razors.
   - Total cost after the buy one get one free offer = \( 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \) dollars.

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Total cost after the coupon = \( 8.00 - 2.00 = 6.00 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total number of razors Heather buys:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs.
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) razors.

5. **Calculate the cost per individual razor:**
   - Total cost after all discounts = $6.00.
   - Total number of razors = 8.
   - Cost per razor = \( \frac{6.00}{8} = 0.75 \) dollars.

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - 1 dollar = 100 cents.
   - Cost per razor in cents = \( 0.75 \times 100 = 75 \) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is \(\boxed{75}\) cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid.

First, we know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The human pyramid is structured as follows:
- 4 girls on the bottom level
- 3 girls on the second level
- 2 girls on the third level
- 1 girl on the top level

The total height of the pyramid will be the sum of the heights of all the girls in the pyramid. We can calculate this as follows:

1. The 4 girls on the bottom level are each 64 inches tall.
2. The 3 girls on the second level are each 64 inches tall.
3. The 2 girls on the third level are each 64 inches tall.
4. The 1 girl on the top level is 60 inches tall.

Now, we calculate the total height:

\[
\text{Total height} = (4 \times 64) + (3 \times 64) + (2 \times 64) + 60
\]

First, calculate the height contributed by the bottom level:

\[
4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, calculate the height contributed by the second level:

\[
3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
\]

Then, calculate the height contributed by the third level:

\[
2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, add the height of the top girl:

\[
60 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, sum all these heights:

\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}\):

\[
\frac{636 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[
\boxed{53 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of hours Charisma works each day:**
   Charisma works for 8 hours every day.

2. **Calculate the number of times she gets up and walks each day:**
   Charisma gets up and walks every hour she is at work. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she gets up and walks 8 times a day.

3. **Determine the duration of each walk:**
   Each walk lasts 5 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes walked each day:**
   Since she walks 8 times a day and each walk is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes walked each day is:
   \[
   8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes walked over 5 days:**
   Since she walks 40 minutes each day, over 5 days the total number of minutes walked is:
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"To determine Angela's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Brett's age in four years.
2. Use the information that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now to find Angela's age in four years.
3. Subtract four years from Angela's age in four years to find her current age.

First, Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, Brett will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times this age is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from 42:
\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently:
\[ \boxed{38} \] years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ morning rides}\).
- The total cost for the morning rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides}\).
- The total cost for the afternoon rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{224}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne.

Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they brought together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per person is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

- Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364\) yards.
- Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364\) yards.

Let's calculate these values:

- Mariah's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91\) yards.
- Her grandma's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182\) yards.

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 273 \]"

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from these 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood. Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Now, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from these 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood. Each 2 x 8 piece gives 400 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since Frederick wants to maximize the number of popsicle sticks, he should buy the 2 x 8 pieces of wood, as they provide more sticks per piece.

\[
\text{Maximum number of sticks} = 1600
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1600}

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass and then compare it to the cost of the bus pass.

First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Janet takes two bus trips each day.
- She takes five bus trips per day.
- Therefore, her total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs her $2.20.
- Thus, her total weekly cost without the bus pass is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we calculate the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from her total weekly cost without the bus pass:
- Savings = Total weekly cost without the bus pass - Cost of the bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by noting the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation based on the relationship:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]

   - For 3 grandchildren, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) scarves.
   - Each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool.
   - Therefore, for 3 scarves, she needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins of wool.

3. **Sweaters**: 
   - Each grandchild needs 1 sweater.
   - For 3 grandchildren, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) sweaters.
   - Each sweater requires 12 skeins of wool.
   - Therefore, for 3 sweaters, she needs \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins of wool.

4. **Mittens**: 
   - Each grandchild needs 1 pair of mittens.
   - For 3 grandchildren, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) pairs of mittens.
   - Each pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool.
   - Therefore, for 3 pairs of mittens, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) skeins of wool.

5. **Socks**: 
   - Each grandchild needs 1 pair of socks.
   - For 3 grandchildren, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) pairs of socks.
   - Each pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool.
   - Therefore, for 3 pairs of socks, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins of wool.

Now, we sum up the total number of skeins of wool required for all items:
\[ 6 \text{ (hats)} + 12 \text{ (scarves)} + 36 \text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \text{ (mittens)} + 6 \text{ (socks)} = 63 \text{ skeins of wool} \]

Thus, the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need to buy is \(\boxed{63}\)."
"To determine how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday.
3. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday.
4. Determine the number of problems Chris completes on Wednesday.
5. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Tuesday is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. The total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday is the sum of the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
4. The number of problems remaining after Tuesday is the total number of problems minus the problems completed by the end of Tuesday:
   \[
   100 - 48 = 52
   \]
5. On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]
6. The number of problems remaining after Wednesday is the number of problems remaining after Tuesday minus the problems completed on Wednesday:
   \[
   52 - 13 = 39
   \]

Thus, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the quarts picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate the weekly consumption and cost for both scenarios.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device.**

- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost before adding the new device:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device.**

- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after adding the new device:
\[ \$21.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$147.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in the weekly electric bill.**

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, we know that for 6 out of the 8 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours each week. This gives us:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for two specific weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. This gives us:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Additionally, for one week, he worked out for 6 hours. This gives us:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up all the hours:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, i.e., \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 63 = 122 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, in 8 years, his cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - Since his cousin will be 65 in 8 years, his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22 years.
   - His cousin's current age is 57 years.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so \( P = C - 400 \).
3. The cost of the computer is $1,100, so \( C = 1100 \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \$300 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of boys.
2. Let \( G \) represent the number of girls.
3. According to the problem, there are 20 kids in total, so:
   \[
   B + G = 20
   \]
4. The boys brought back 60 seashells each. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
   \[
   60B
   \]
5. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
   \[
   60B + 4 \times 60B = 60B + 240B = 300B
   \]
6. Since the girls are divided into two equal groups, each girl brought:
   \[
   \frac{300B}{G}
   \]
7. We know that \( G = 20 - B \). Substituting \( G \) in the equation for the number of seashells each girl brought:
   \[
   \frac{300B}{20 - B}
   \]

To find the value of \( B \), we need to ensure that \( B \) and \( 20 - B \) are integers and that the total number of kids is 20. Since \( B \) and \( 20 - B \) must be integers, \( B \) can be any integer from 0 to 20. However, since there are girls, \( B \) must be less than 20. We can test values of \( B \) to find a consistent solution.

Let's test \( B = 10 \):
\[
G = 20 - 10 = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total seashells brought by boys} = 60 \times 10 = 600
\]
\[
\text{Total seashells brought by girls} = 300 \times 10 = 3000
\]
\[
\text{Seashells brought by each girl} = \frac{3000}{10} = 300
\]

Thus, each girl brought 300 seashells. We can verify this solution by checking the total number of seashells:
\[
\text{Total seashells} = 600 + 3000 = 3600
\]

The calculations are consistent, so the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The number of vlogs made in the first week is 18.
The number of vlogs made in the second week is 21.
The number of vlogs made in the third week is 15.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's monthly goal is 72 vlogs. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her monthly goal. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to find out how many days are in the second half of April. April has 30 days, so the first half of April has 15 days and the second half has 15 days as well.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half of April as \( x \) dollars per day. Therefore, the total amount saved in the first half of April is \( 15x \) dollars.

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. So, the amount he saves in the second half of April is \( 2x \) dollars per day. Therefore, the total amount saved in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars.

The total amount saved in April is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves of the month:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \( 25 \) dollars per day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he needs to save \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \) dollars per day in the second half of April.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earns and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 for each task.
- Jairus finished 20 tasks.

\[
\text{Jairus's total earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 for each task.
- Jenny finished 20 tasks.

\[
\text{Jenny's total earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's total earnings:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Jairus's total earnings} - \text{Jenny's total earnings} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down the commission structure and apply it to her sales.

1. **Initial Commission Calculation:**
   - For the first $1000 of sales, Antonella earns a 30% commission.
   - Commission on $1000 = 30% of $1000 = 0.30 * $1000 = $300.

2. **Additional Commission Calculation:**
   - For sales over $1000, Antonella earns an additional 10% commission on the amount exceeding $1000.
   - Sales over $1000 = $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Additional commission on $1500 = 10% of $1500 = 0.10 * $1500 = $150.

3. **Total Commission Calculation:**
   - Total commission = Initial commission + Additional commission
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 from her sales worth $2500.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we need to first calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water conditions, and then use these times to find the total time for 3 miles.

1. **Time to swim a mile in cold water:**
   Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Time to swim a mile in warm water:**
   The problem states that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. 
   - Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

3. **Total time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - Time for 1 mile = 16 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Total time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - Time for 1 mile = 34 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

5. **Difference in time to swim 3 miles between warm and cold water:**
   - Time difference = Time in warm water - Time in cold water
   - Time difference = \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag. We know that there are 21 buttons in total, with 7 buttons having two holes and the rest having four holes.

First, we calculate the number of buttons that have four holes:
\[ \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = \text{Total number of buttons} - \text{Number of buttons with two holes} \]
\[ \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with two holes:
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with two holes} = \text{Number of buttons with two holes} \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with two holes} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with four holes:
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with four holes} = \text{Number of buttons with four holes} \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total holes from buttons with four holes} = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Finally, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons to get the overall total number of holes:
\[ \text{Total number of holes} = \text{Total holes from buttons with two holes} + \text{Total holes from buttons with four holes} \]
\[ \text{Total number of holes} = 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the volume of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. The reduction in cups of coffee that Juan must reduce is \( 5R - 4 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined without the value of \( R \). If we assume \( R = 4 \) (a common daily recommendation), then the reduction would be \( 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups. However, since the problem does not specify \( R \), the answer in terms of \( R \) is:

\[
\boxed{5R - 4}

- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

The final numerical answer is:
45"
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \) upward.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.
   - After 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees above the tip of the pyramid.
   - Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the initial angle and the upward movement of the sun.

\[
\text{Final angle from the ground} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}

"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the total number of candles James needs. Since he needs one candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, to find out how much James spends, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 × $3 = $12.

So, the final numerical answer is $12."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, the number of pages she can read in 105 minutes is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Shiloh's current age as \( S \).
- His nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

So, in 7 years:
- Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.
- His nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth.
   \[
   1 \text{ tooth} \times \$1.00 = \$1.00
   \]
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 = \$2.00
   \]
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 = \$3.00
   \]
   Total for the next three teeth:
   \[
   \$1.00 + \$2.00 + \$3.00 = \$6.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as received for each of the previous three teeth.
   \[
   \text{Amount per tooth for the first three teeth} = \$1.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Half of \$1.00} = \$0.50

"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday through Wednesday and the number of plastic action figures he will buy from Thursday through Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \times \$5 \text{ per figure} = \$20 \]

This means Peter has:
\[ \$70 - \$20 = \$50 \]
left for the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday).

Next, we calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining \$50. Since each plastic action figure costs \$2, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \frac{\$50}{\$2 \text{ per figure}} = 25 \text{ figures} \]

Now, we add the number of wooden action figures and the number of plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:
\[ 4 \text{ wooden figures} + 25 \text{ plastic figures} = 29 \text{ figures} \]

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks):
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month by subtracting the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:

"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total cost of bread:**
   - The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - They need to make 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, they need 1 loaf of bread.
   - Total cost of bread = $3.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost of cheese and condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost per sandwich:**
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.
   - Cost per sandwich = $33.00 / 10 = $3.30.

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

5. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Total cost = Cost per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.30 * 10 = $33.00.
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is \(\boxed{37.00}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This operation involves adding half of the starting value to the starting value and then dividing the result by 5. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{S + \frac{S}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{20}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The result from the first operation (which is 6) is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
   \[
   6 \times (S - 12)
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is consistently off by 4%. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( T \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be \( T + 0.04T = 1.04T \). We know this should equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04T = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of the first and second movies together.

First, convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.

"First, we need to calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For every 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, the amount of water she needs to drink is:
  \[
  \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans.
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans.
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
2. \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)
3. The total number of jelly beans is \( R + B + G = 4500 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the total number of jelly beans equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

Finally, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can determine the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to find the plane's speed.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. The speed of the plane is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. The time required to travel 2000 miles is:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the number of additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. Since Ruiz works at a rate of 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours he will make:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Similarly, since Marissa works at a rate of 45 pounds per hour, in 12 hours she will make:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the totals together, the total amount of chocolate made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is:

\[ \text{Total chocolate} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract this from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday:**
   Howard spends $8 at the arcade.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Monday} = \$8
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Tuesday} = 2 \times \$8 = \$16
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Howard spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Wednesday} = 4 \times \$16 = \$64
   \]

Next, we sum the amounts spent over the three days:
\[
\text{Total spent} = \$8 + \$16 + \$64 = \$88
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from Howard's initial amount of $100 to find out how much money he has left:
\[
\text{Money left} = \$100 - \$88 = \$12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:

"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires make in a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in a month.**

Given:
- Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
- Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

First, find the number of rotations per mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in 400 miles:
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.**

Given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash to cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is also a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"

"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = \text{Length of Monica's street} \times \text{Cost per meter}
\]
\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = \text{Length of Lewis' street} \times \text{Cost per meter}
\]
\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 94860 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[
\text{Difference in cost} = \text{Cost for Lewis' street} - \text{Cost for Monica's street}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65760 \, \text{dollars}

"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, we calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights at all 4 intersections. Since there are 24 street lights at each intersection and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Finally, we need to account for the 20 street lights that are not working. The number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the given speed to megabits per second (Mb/s):**
   - Ashley's speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s).
   - Since 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb), we convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s:
     \[
     20 \text{ kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \text{ Mb/s} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

2. **Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
   - To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour:
     \[
     0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
     \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in megabits per hour is:

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Calculate the difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow enough to meet the height requirement.

First, convert Adam's height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. So, the difference in height is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \text{ per car} = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we determine the profit James made from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:
\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \text{ of } \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives:**
   - Given that only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
   - There are 100 riders in total.
   - Number of riders who can stay upright = \( 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \).

2. **Calculate the number of these riders who are women:**
   - Of the 25 riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
   - Number of women = \( 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \).

3. **Calculate the number of these riders who are men:**
   - The remaining riders are men.
   - Number of men = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women.
   - Number of men = \( 25 - 15 = 10 \).

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

   \[
   \text{Price of a diamond jewel} = \$2000
   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[

   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we sum the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is at most $10.

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{C}{n} \]

We need:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

3. **Determine the cost structure:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour.

4. **Calculate the cost for each hour in the paid period:**
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - The second hour costs \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
   - The third hour costs \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

5. **Sum the costs for the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = $15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{105}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \times 2 \text{ whole eggs/deviled egg half} = 96 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{96 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 8 \text{ dozens} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, we first need to calculate how many pages she has already written. Shiela has written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book if he reads 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading. This is calculated by subtracting the total number of days required from the deadline:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for renting a hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane plus the annual expenses:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The cooking time for beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \).

First, we calculate \( P \):
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ \text{Total time} = R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads is 20.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive coffee brand:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day:
\[ \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee:
\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

Gus bought:
- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\)
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, we sum the costs of these items:
\[4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198.

The number of newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

So, the calculation for District B is:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = \text{Total newspapers} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C}) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours John attends.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total class hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of class hours.**

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. The class lasts for 6 weeks.

\[
\text{Total class hours} = \text{Number of classes per week} \times \text{Hours per class} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]

\[
\text{Total class hours} = 4 \times 2 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many recipes he learns.**

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the number of hours per recipe.

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\text{Total time spent sleeping} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they share equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together.

\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share this total amount of money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining 6 days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The next three days are: Good, Neutral, Good

Adding these to the existing counts:
- Good days: \(12 + 2 = 14\)
- Bad days: \(8\) (unchanged)
- Neutral days: \(10 + 1 = 11\) (since one neutral day is already counted)

The total number of days is still 30, and the counts are consistent.

Finally, we need to find the number of good days left in the month:
\[
\text{Total good days} = 14
\]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{14}

First, we can substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the second equation:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, we can find the number of cookies Summer has using the third equation:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) centimeters. Additionally, she adds 20 centimeters to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 centimeters.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the times to minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken for each half is:
- Time for the first half in ""turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- Time for the second half in ""rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Now, we sum these times to find the total time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school.
2. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
3. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we calculate the total time they have already spent walking:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price of apples is $4 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the cost of apples is \( 1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4 \).

2. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price of bananas is $2 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the cost of bananas is \( 2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4 \).

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price of oranges is $3 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the cost of oranges is \( 2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6 \).

Next, we sum the costs of the apples, bananas, and oranges to find the total amount Catherine pays:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Then, we account for the cookies that Greta and Celinda eat while the cookies are cooling. They eat 10 cookies, so we subtract these from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of the twins as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), and the ages of the triplets as \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \).

Given:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

We can express the first condition as:
\[ T_1 = P_i + 7 \]
where \( P_i \) is one of the triplet ages.

The second condition can be written as:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are twins, their ages are the same, so:
\[ T_1 = T_2 \]

Let's substitute \( T_1 \) for \( T_2 \) in the combined ages equation:
\[ T_1 + T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know from the first condition that:
\[ T_1 = P_i + 7 \]

Let's assume \( P_i = P_1 \) (the same triplet age can be used for simplicity):
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

Substitute \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \) into the combined ages equation:
\[ 2(P_1 + 7) + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_1 + 14 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 3P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]

Since \( P_1, P_2, \) and \( P_3 \) are ages of triplets, they must be positive integers. Let's test possible values for \( P_1 \):

If \( P_1 = 8 \):
\[ 3(8) + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]
\[ 24 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]
\[ P_2 + P_3 = 6 \]

Possible pairs \((P_2, P_3)\) that sum to 6 are \((1, 5)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((5, 1)\).

Let's choose \( P_2 = 3 \) and \( P_3 = 3 \) (since the ages are the same for simplicity):
\[ P_1 = 8 \]
\[ P_2 = 3 \]
\[ P_3 = 3 \]

Now, calculate \( T_1 \):
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total time John spends on his homework. The time spent on each subject is as follows:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many minutes John has left for napping, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes John has to nap is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one candy first, and then use that information to find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.

1. **Determine the cost of one lollipop:**
   Manolo bought five lollipops for $3.20. Therefore, the cost of one lollipop is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one lollipop} = \frac{3.20}{5} = 0.64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of one candy:**
   We know that Manolo bought four candies for $3.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:**
   Since each lollipop costs $0.64, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.64 = 6.40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of 10 candies:**
   Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:**
   Adding the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6.40 + 8.00 = 14.40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14.40}
\]"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years.
4. Sum the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.**
Rong saves 20 coins per month.

**Step 2: Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month.**
Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[
20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years.**
There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[
20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[
28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

**Step 4: Sum the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.**
\[
2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}
\]

Thus, the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years is:
\[
\boxed{5760}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( T \) be the total bill. Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[
\text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[
\text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[
5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[
12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[
7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each colored square and then sum these areas.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of each colored square to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
\text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
\text{Total area} = 68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs Mia currently has is:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get is:

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

To find out how many more points are needed to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points:
\[

"First, we need to calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement account} = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for this purpose.

\[ \text{Amount used for car payment} = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Amount left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that they raise an equal amount in every hour.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:

   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]
   - Therefore, 32% of the total Colorado River water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]
   - Therefore, 8% of the total Colorado River water is used for non-industrial purposes by Colorado City.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to first find the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

**Chocolate Ice Cream:**
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

**Vanilla Ice Cream:**
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours.

**Chocolate Ice Cream:**
- Production rate: 50 quarts per hour
- Total production in 48 hours:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]

**Vanilla Ice Cream:**
- Production rate: 12.5 quarts per hour
- Total production in 48 hours:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know that Dora is 15 years old. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
\]
Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation, we get:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
\]
Substituting the father's age (38) into the equation, we get:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidates A and B are 20 and 30 respectively. Therefore, the votes for candidate C are:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving 10 apples to Beck, Boris's new number of apples is:

\[ \text{Boris's new apples} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck's new number of apples is:

\[ \text{Beck's new apples} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's new apples} - \text{Beck's new apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck now has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

1. **Determine Steven's number of books:**
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - Therefore, \( 2S = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Steven has 10 books.

2. **Determine Alice's number of books:**
   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
   - Therefore, \( A = S + 6 \).

"To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of a half-gallon jar.
2. Calculate the cost of 10 gallon jars.
3. Calculate the cost of 16 half-gallon jars.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3.

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less than a gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 gallon jars:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students who like to play video games. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote:
- \( V \) as the number of students who like to play video games.
- \( M \) as the number of students who like to play music.

From the problem, we know:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
This means 10 students like to play music.

The number of students who like to play video games or music is:
\[ V + M = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]
Since \( M = 10 \), we can substitute to find \( V \):
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
\[ V = 35 - 10 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many birds were scared away by Jeremy throwing the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that number. We calculate \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 12 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got 1 card worth $4000, 1 card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 $50 cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the profit Mark made is:

\[

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question as stated is not feasible.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups (as initially stated), we can proceed with that interpretation.

To find out how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups:
- Number of groups initially stated = 6
- Number of groups required = 12

The number of additional groups needed:
\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\).
- Total chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\].

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}\].

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know the total monthly cost for electricity is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate pays each month:
\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find out how much each roommate will pay in a year, we multiply the monthly cost per roommate by the number of months in a year (12):
\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent out.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 8 dozen glasses equals \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- 4 dozen plates. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 4 dozen plates equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent.

For the glasses:
- Total glasses sent: 96
- Broken glasses: 10
- Remaining glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\)

For the plates:
- Total plates sent: 48

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{107}\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to sum the matches he played on each day of the week.

1. Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. Joey played 1 match on Friday.
3. Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

The problem states that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:

- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \text{ cases} \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase, we need to calculate the cost of each person's purchase separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Leila's Purchase:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - Each cucumber costs $2.
   - Total cost for Leila = 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.

2. **Jack's Purchase:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - Each tomato costs $1.
   - Total cost for Jack = 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5.

3. **Chase's Purchase:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - Each head of lettuce costs $3.
   - Total cost for Chase = 1 head of lettuce * $3/head of lettuce = $3.

Now, we sum the individual costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Leila's cost + Jack's cost + Chase's cost
- Total cost = $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

Thus, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we first need to find out how many pears he has. We know that George has 45% more pears than bananas. Given that George has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

1. Calculate 45% of the number of bananas:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

2. Add this number to the number of bananas to find the number of pears:
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 = 290 \]

3. Now, add the number of bananas and the number of pears to find the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, the total number of fruits George has is:
\[ \boxed{490} \]"

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining $60. Each candy bar costs $5. To find the number of candy bars she can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ 60 \div 5 = 12 \]

Thus, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
   - Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, 4 liters of juice would require \(4 \times 5 = 20\) kilograms of oranges.

2. Calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges.
   - Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so 20 kilograms would cost \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read:**
   - We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour.
   - According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed read.
   - Therefore, \( 2A = 300 \).
   - Solving for \( A \), we get \( A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of books Ezra read:**
   - Ezra initially read 300 books and then decided to read 150 more.
   - Total books Ezra read = \( 300 + 150 = 450 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of books Ahmed read:**
   - Ahmed read 150 books.

4. **Calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:**
   - Total books read = Books read by Ezra + Books read by Ahmed
   - Total books read = \( 450 + 150 = 600 \).

Thus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5/\text{day} = 1 \times 5 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, sum the base and additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 305 \text{ dollars} \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day:
\[ 0 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, sum the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 0 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, sum the earnings for both days:
\[ 305 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 365 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

"First, we need to determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since Anthony initially had 50 pencils and he gave 1/2 of them to Brandon, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils remaining}
\]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. We calculate the number of pencils given to Charlie as follows:

\[
\text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:

\[
25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total driving time and add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time taken to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \] wheels.

Thus, the number of wheels left is \(\boxed{276}\)."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. A 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means we subtract 20% of $1000 from the original price.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price you have to pay.

\[ \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many movies are in series and how many are older movies.

Mike has a total of 600 movies. A third of these are in series:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ movies} \]

So, the number of movies that are not in series is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies} \]

Next, we calculate how many of these 400 movies are older movies. 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies:
\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies} \]

The remaining movies after accounting for the series and the older movies are:
\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the normal movies is $10 each. The cost of the older movies is $5 each.

The cost of the series movies is:
\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the older movies is:
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the normal movies is:
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance driven is given by:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
The distance hiked is given by:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances driven and hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can express these relationships as:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (30 - 4) = 30 \times 26 = 780 \) (since finishing 4 seconds slower means they each lose 4 seconds, and the total time is 30 seconds, so the difference is 4 seconds)

Now, let's calculate the total score for each player:
- Ava's score: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) + 5 \times (B_A - B_E) + 780 \)
- Emma's score: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) + 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)

Since \( E_A = E_E + 8 \) and \( B_A = B_E + 3 \), we substitute these into the score formulas:
- Ava's score: \( 10 \times 8 + 5 \times 3 + 780 = 80 + 15 + 780 = 875 \)
- Emma's score: \( 10 \times 8 + 5 \times 3 = 80 + 15 = 95 \)

The difference between their scores is:
\[ 875 - 95 = 780 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{780}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Four Pizzas:**
   The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.

2. **Cost of Two Pizzas:**
   Two of the pizzas cost $30 each.

3. **Total Cost of the Two Known Pizzas:**
   The cost of the two pizzas that cost $30 each is:
   \[
   30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of the Other Two Pizzas:**
   The total cost of the four pizzas is $64. Therefore, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:
   \[
   64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Each of the Other Two Pizzas:**
   Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of rides on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of rides on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

The solution is correct. The number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.
2. Determine the amount of gas consumed per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the gas consumed per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.**

Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

For 5 days, the total distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of gas consumed per week.**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of gas consumed per week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gas consumed per week.**

The price of regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of 140 quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of 10 twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch. This is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, we find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much more money John needs after accounting for the school's contribution.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school's contribution is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

John currently has $50. After the school's contribution, the remaining amount John needs is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

Since John already has $50, the additional amount he needs is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees, we calculate the temperature difference needed to reach 32 degrees:

\[ 45 - 32 = 13 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we know that each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 13 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 2.6 \text{ logs} \]

Since Carson cannot burn a fraction of a log, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to burn 3 logs to ensure the temperature does not fall below 32 degrees.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people:
\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of these groups brought back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells:
\[
\text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the value of these bottle caps in dollars.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. Therefore, in a 30-day month, he will find:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours on last Tuesday. Since her regular workday is 8 hours, she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Now, we calculate the payment for her regular hours and her additional hours separately.

For the 8 regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

For the 3 additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the payments for the regular hours and the additional hours to find the total payment for the day:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Now, Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the discounted price from $50:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"
"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total duration of singing both ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice.
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Deck the Halls""} = 2 \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once.
- Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Jingle Bells""} = 1 \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:

\[
\text{Total caroling time} = 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is:

\[
\boxed{540 \text{ seconds}}

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's calculate Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary.
- Billy's initial salary is $10 per hour.
- Therefore, Sally's starting salary is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate the earnings for 20 hours for both Billy and Sally:
- **Billy's earnings for 20 hours:** $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.
- **Sally's earnings for 20 hours:** $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = $230 - $210 = $20.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Nikita scored.
2. Add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita.

First, we know that Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. We can calculate half of Pierson's points and then add 11 to that value.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Adding 11 to this value gives us Nikita's points:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"

First, let's calculate the number of students in the school:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

Now, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she has played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she has played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the first car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the second car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:

\[
\text{Difference in distance} = \text{Distance traveled by the second car} - \text{Distance traveled by the first car} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount James paid, we need to calculate the cost of the ring including the premium.

First, we find the total cost of the ring without the premium:
- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost without premium:
\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we calculate the premium:
- The premium is 30% of the total cost without the premium.

Calculate the premium:
\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, add the premium to the total cost without the premium to find the total amount James paid:
\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Thus, the total amount James paid is:
\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate:
   \[
   \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass count:**
   \[
   \text{Pass count} = 340
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass count:**
   \[
   \text{Pass count} = 40
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass count:**
   \[
   \text{Pass count} = 0.80 \times 400 = 320
   \]

Now, we sum the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

1. **Total number of students tested:**
   \[
   500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
   \]

2. **Total number of students who passed:**
   \[

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can create with the chips he has.
3. Use the area to find the length of the mosaic.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Therefore, the total area of the mosaic he can create is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by the product of its length and height:
\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Orders and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 butterscotch candies.

2. **Remaining Candies After Sales:**
   - Since Dale sold 150 candies out of the 100 he initially ordered, he would have sold more than he had ordered. This means he has already sold all 100 candies and more, which implies he has sold 50 more candies than he had ordered.
   - Therefore, Dale has 0 candies left from his initial order because he has already sold all 100 candies.

3. **Additional Orders:**
   - Dale then ordered 100 more butterscotch candies.

4. **Total Candies Dale Has Now:**
   - Dale has 0 candies from his initial order and 100 candies from his additional order.
   - Total candies Dale has now = 0 + 100 = 100 candies.

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to understand the total number of branches he climbed during the week and then divide that by the number of days in a week.

Felix made $105 during the week. Since each branch he climbs costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
\]

Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by the number of days:

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7}

4. Calculate the total number of petals from the fourth set of flowers.
5. Sum the petals from all sets.
6. Subtract the petals lost when Rose drops 1 of each type and the wind blows away 1 of each type.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **First set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 3
   - Petals per flower: 5
   - Total petals: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

2. **Second set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 4
   - Petals per flower: 6
   - Total petals: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

3. **Third set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 5
   - Petals per flower: 4
   - Total petals: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)

4. **Fourth set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 6
   - Petals per flower: 7
   - Total petals: \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

Now, sum the petals from all sets:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \]

Next, calculate the number of petals lost:
- Rose drops 1 of each type, so she loses \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) flowers.
- Each dropped flower has a different number of petals:
  - 1 flower with 5 petals
  - 1 flower with 6 petals
  - 1 flower with 4 petals
  - 1 flower with 7 petals
- Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\)

"First, we need to determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total playtime and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the playtime for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total playtime for all four friends:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows 20 minutes of playtime, we need to determine how many quarters are required for 240 minutes of playtime:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, the total amount of money used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the quantities used:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) in the equation for oil:
\[ O = 2S \]

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total mixture equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil used is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Thus, the total amount of money John spent is:

\[
\boxed{4500}

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is 16.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine how much each student raised, we first need to find out how much money the students raised in total. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she spent walking each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. 

Next, we are told that on the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she spent walking on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to convert the total time spent walking over the two days from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we calculate the total time in minutes as follows:
\[
8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, calculate the daily earnings:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00

"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18.

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know \( P \), we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs:
\[ 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we'll find the difference between the shipping cost and the refund.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The cost for the weight is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost for the distance is \(20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \(32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
   - The net loss is \(3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars}\).

Since the net loss is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21.00. However, the question asks for the amount of money Milly will lose, which in this context is the absolute value of the net loss.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production:**
   Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

6. **Fourth Week Production:**
   To find the production for the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs each week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent writing songs is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup each week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on makeup is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the animals, the distance they travel, and the time it takes.

First, let's denote the speed of the kangaroos as \( v \) (in distance units per hour). Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total distance \( D \) of the highway can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to determine the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). The time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{4 \times \frac{v}{2}} = \frac{54v}{4 \times \frac{v}{2}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours it will take for four turtles to travel across the highway is:

"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by identifying the number of dishes each person made based on the information provided.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, we calculate Rory's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, we calculate Jada's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Dishes:**
   To find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we sum the dishes each person made:
   \[
   \text{Total dishes} = \text{Jada's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Kora's dishes} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = \text{total money} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total money she has is $50 less than the final price of the laptop:
\[ \text{total money} = 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently.
2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters.
3. Calculate how many more cows are required to produce the additional milk needed.

First, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

Next, the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
\[ \text{Money still needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money Gabriel has} \]
\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$5600 \]"
"To determine the change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the total amount given from the cost of the hat to find the change.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Thea gave:
Thea gave four $20 bills. Therefore, the total amount is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount given from the cost of the hat to find the change:
The cost of the hat is $70. So, the change is:
\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig has to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into this equation, we get \( 60 = 2S \), which means \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) items.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.**

There are 90 rooms in total, and we need to clean one-half of them:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes.**

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, for 45 rooms:
\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**

There are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert 900 minutes to hours:
\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. In the third year, the town builds twice the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   Then, the number of homes built in the third year is:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), substituting \( B = Y + 3 \), we get \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now, substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

"First, we need to determine how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we calculate:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. Therefore, the amount of money Julieta received in tips is:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we add the tips received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of money they received altogether:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   \[
   \text{Wendy's badges in a year} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges}
   \]

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Wendy's badges} - \text{Amber's badges} = 36 - 6 = 30
   \]

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = \text{Number of silver coins} + 30 \]

Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we isolate \( A \) by subtracting 37 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, we solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the jello.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 jello cups.
\[
30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

A three-ounce box of jello makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups per box.
\[
\frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the jello.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. To find the total cost for 12 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

"To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} = 10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Pieces eaten on the third day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Total pieces eaten so far**:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

The total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to find the cost per bottle of soda and per bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00.

First, we calculate the cost per bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda:
\[ \text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

Then, we calculate the cost for 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

The total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
\]
So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000
\]
The total revenue from selling the chickens is $9000.

Since the problem states that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, we can use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens. The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of the chickens. Let \( C \) be the cost of the chickens. Then:
\[
9000 - C = 2000
\]
Solving for \( C \):
\[
C = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, so the difference is:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah to buy the rope for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have left after she buys the rope. Since she plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope, we need to know the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.

Let's assume Sarah sells the rope for the full price of $2 per meter. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the rope is $40.

Now, we need to find out how many meters of the new rope Sarah can buy with $40. The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter.

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope.

Now, we calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we determine how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope:

\[
\text{Money left} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Melanie's current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So, we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is given by:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesdays:**
   - Number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays = 125

2. **Wednesdays:**
   - Number of chimichangas made on Wednesdays = 125

3. **Fridays:**
   - Number of chimichangas made on Fridays = Twice as many as on Tuesdays
   - Twice as many as 125 = \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \)

"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired.
3. Divide the number of pairable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

First, we calculate 20% of the 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

Next, we subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total 50 microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 microphones can be paired.

Finally, we divide the 40 pairable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding}

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

\[
\text{Total petals for orchids} = 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.

\[
\text{Total petals for daisies} = 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:

\[
\text{Difference in petals} = \text{Total petals for daisies} - \text{Total petals for orchids} = 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals}
\]

Thus, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

First, we know the cost of the salad is $6. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the cost of the yogurt is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of one carrot be \( x \) dollars. Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of the carrots is:
\[ 2x \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of her daily diet is the sum of the cost of the carrots, the salad, and the yogurt:
\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Then we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 1 \]

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The payment Tasha received for mowing Joe's lawn is $6. Since she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the payment per mowing is:
\[ \text{Payment per mowing} = \frac{6}{x} \]

Now, let's calculate the total payment Tasha received from mowing lawns:
- For Kamala's lawn: \( 3x \times \frac{6}{x} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \)
- For Alba's lawn: \( 5x \times \frac{6}{x} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)

Adding these payments together gives the total payment from mowing lawns:
\[ 18 + 30 = 48 \]

Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns last month were $80. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:

"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha originally had.
2. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.
3. Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M + 5 = 7
   \]
4. Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M + 5 = 7 \implies M = 7 - 5 \implies M = 2
   \]
   So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.
5. Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks, which is:
   \[
   3M = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
6. Martha now has 7 notebooks.
7. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has:

"To determine the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Dijana rowed.
2. Calculate the distance Anis rowed based on the information that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.
3. Sum the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis.

First, we know that Dijana rowed 50 miles. 

Next, we calculate the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this as:
\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\right) \]
\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of adult bowls in the pot:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

4. **Calculate the number of child's bowls in the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls and 8 child's bowls, we can set up the following proportion:
     \[
     \text{Number of adult bowls} : \text{Number of child's bowls} = 4 : 8
     \]
   - Simplifying the ratio, we get:
     \[
     1 : 2
     \]
   - Therefore, for every 1 adult bowl, there are 2 child's bowls.

5. **Determine the total number of child's bowls in the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, the number of child's bowls is:
     \[
     4 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 \text{ child's bowls per adult bowl} = 8 \text{ child's bowls}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - There are 2 children, and there are 8 child's bowls.
   - Each child will get:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ child's bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 4 \text{ bowls per child}
     \]

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times.

"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought five notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought one ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Thus, the total amount William spent is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Material for 20 small masks = \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Then, we calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Material for 8 large masks = \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."

"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on various activities and then subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. **Time Harold sleeps**: 10 hours.
2. **Time Harold works**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Time Harold walks his dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time spent on activities} = \text{Sleep} + \text{Work} + \text{Dog walking} = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours. Therefore, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ \text{Free time} = \text{Total hours in a day} - \text{Total time spent on activities} = 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then calculate how old he will be in 8 years.

Let's denote:
- Duncan's current age as \( D \)
- Adam's current age as \( A \)

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \)
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \)
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \)
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \)

We can solve the equation \( 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \) to find Adam's current age \( A \):

\[
52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
26 = A - 4
\]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[
A = 30
\]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[
30 + 8 = 38

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that each row has the same number of chamomile tea cups and the same number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, each row has \( 2x \) cups of tea.

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

So, we have:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row, and there are \( x \) cups of mint tea in each row, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ x = 2 \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we know that the sloth takes 4 hours to complete one trip down to the ground, pick up berries, and climb back up to the tree. We need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we know that the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2.
- Total spent on popcorn and candy = (2 * $8) + (4 * $2) = $16 + $8 = $24.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from his total monthly budget:
- Total monthly budget = $150.
- Amount spent on popcorn and candy = $24.
- Remaining budget = $150 - $24 = $126.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining budget. We know that tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, and tickets for other days cost $7 each. Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, he can only see movies on Fridays and Saturdays at the regular price of $10 each.

Let's calculate how many movies he can see with the remaining $126:
- Number of movies he can see = Remaining budget / Cost per movie = $126 / $10 = 12.6.

Since he can only see whole movies, he can see 12 more movies.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."

\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"

\[ 14 \]"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of water balloons each person had:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so each friend received \(2\) water balloons.
- Maria herself received \(1\) water balloon.

So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding Maria's water balloon:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons.

So, the total number of additional water balloons given by her mom is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff:

   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. They can fit 2 boxes per table.

4. Calculate the number of tables needed:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. Calculate the number of new tables needed:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables}

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is:
410"
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the cost of gas, which is $50. After spending $50 on gas, his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract this amount from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for 5 pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour to ensure Patty gets paid for the full hour. Thus, the labor cost is for 3 hours.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, let's calculate each component:

- Labor cost: $35/hour * 3 hours = $105
- Parts cost: $60

Adding these together gives the total charge:

"To determine how much money James was out, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount.
2. Apply the 40% discount to find the total cost after the discount.
3. Determine the cost of the CDs James decided to keep.
4. Calculate the revenue from selling the CDs he decided to sell.
5. Determine the net loss by subtracting the revenue from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the 40% discount to find the total cost after the discount:**
   The discount is 40%, so the price James pays is 60% of the original price.
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of the CDs James decided to keep:**
   James decides to keep 5 CDs, and each CD costs $15.
   \[
   \text{Cost of CDs kept} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the CDs he decided to sell:**
   James sells 5 CDs for $40.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling CDs} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the net loss by subtracting the revenue from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Net loss} = \text{Total cost after discount} - \text{Revenue from selling CDs} = 90 - 40 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money James was out is:

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we sum up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"First, let's determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information provided.

We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of loaves of bread in the bakery} = 7 \times (\text{Number of loaves of bread Sam had}) - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves of bread Sam had:

\[ \text{Number of loaves of bread in the bakery} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Then, subtract 40:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Number of copies: 6
- Cost per copy: $5

The commission from the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Number of copies: 10
- Cost per copy: $15

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

"To determine Leo's age, we can set up the problem with the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age, so if we let Leo's age be \(L\), then \(L / 2 = 21\).

From the equation \(L / 2 = 21\), we can solve for \(L\) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before sleepwalking and before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 3 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 220 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. He has two dozen measuring cups, and since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons he has left:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients}
\]

We add these 700 patients to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 \text{ initial occupied beds} + 700 \text{ new patients} = 900 \text{ beds}
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 \text{ total beds} - 900 \text{ occupied beds} = 100 \text{ beds}
\]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Emails Sent per Day**: Robyn sends 16 emails per day.

2. **Work Emails**: Robyn sends 7 work emails per day.

3. **Remaining Emails**: Subtract the work emails from the total emails.
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 emails remaining after sending the work emails.

4. **Family Emails**: Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, Robyn sends 6 emails to her family.

5. **Remaining Emails After Family**: Subtract the family emails from the remaining emails.
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
   So, there are 3 emails left after sending emails to her family.

6. **Boyfriend Emails**: One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Shawna's father's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Shawna's age.
2. Use Shawna's age to find her father's age.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:
\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set \( 2J = 2 \), which implies \( J = 1 \). So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."

- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8
- Holes filled on the third day: 2

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 10 \]

Now, we calculate the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Finally, we find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting \( M = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southerly and northerly directions separately and then find the net distance.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Calculate the distance traveled in the southerly direction after turning around:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

4. **Determine the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:**
   - The bird initially flies 300 miles south and then flies 110 miles south.
   - Net distance traveled south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.

5. **Determine the net distance traveled in the northerly direction:**
   - The bird flies 36 miles north.
   - Net distance traveled north = 36 miles north.

6. **Calculate the net distance between the northern and southern homes:**
   - The net distance between the northern and southern homes is the difference between the net distance traveled south and the net distance traveled north.
   - Net distance = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. **Brownies made for herself:**
   Greta made one dozen brownies for herself.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies sent to her from the office party:**
   Greta received half a dozen brownies from her office party.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Brownies given to her by her friends:**
   Greta received four dozen brownies from her friends.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}

4. **Total brownies received:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 \text{ (made for herself)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies left over:**
   Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total brownies received:
   \[
   66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E = 19 \) years. When Emil turns 24, his age will be 24 years. At that time, his dad's age will be \( D + 24 - 19 = D + 5 \) and his brother's age will be \( B + 24 - 19 = B + 5 \).

According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Additionally, the problem states that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie wears size 25 boots. Now, we need to find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average size is calculated by adding the sizes of the boots and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Thus, the average size of the shoes worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to calculate the number of additional plants she needs to buy and then find the total cost.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective space each plant occupies. Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there is a 1.5 feet (18 inches) gap between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant and the gap between it is:
\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ 44 \text{ plants} \]

Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate the number of pretzels his brother eats per day as follows:
\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels his brother eats per day by 7:
\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week is:
\[
\boxed{63}
\]"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plants in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost per basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Katherine has 5 baskets, so we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations, and then find out how much soil is left for the roses.

First, calculate the soil used by the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the soil used by the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtract the total soil used from the total soil available to find the remaining soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp and the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
  \[
  \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 90 shrimp:
- Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30:
  \[
  \frac{90}{30} = 3
  \]
- Since each set of 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:
  \[
  3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we sum the time it takes to peel and saute the shrimp:
\[
15 \text{ minutes (peeling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (sauteing)} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the total cooling and the total warming to find the net change in temperature:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).

Net change in temperature:
\[ 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\]

Since the net change is a cooling effect, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the Comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the time interval between the first and second sightings of the Comet:
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is \(90 - 30 = 60\) years.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we need to find out how many orbits the Comet completed in 60 years:
- In 60 years, the Comet completes \(\frac{60}{75} = \frac{4}{5}\) of an orbit.

Given that the time interval between sightings is 60 years, and the time for one orbit is 75 years, we can infer that the first sighting occurred 60 years before the second sighting. Therefore, Bill saw the Comet for the first time 60 years before he saw it for the second time.

Since Bill was 30 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, we can determine his age when he saw it for the first time:
- If Bill was 30 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, then he was \(30 - 60 = -30\) years old, which is not possible. This indicates that the first sighting was 60 years before the second sighting, and we need to adjust our understanding of the time frame.

Given that the time interval between sightings is 60 years and the Comet completes \(\frac{4}{5}\) of an orbit in 60 years, we can conclude that the first sighting was 60 years before the second sighting. Therefore, Bill was 30 - 60 = -30 years old, which is not possible. Instead, we need to consider the correct time frame.

Since the time interval is 60 years and the Comet completes \(\frac{4}{5}\) of an orbit in 60 years, we can conclude that the first sighting was 60 years before the second sighting. Therefore, Bill was 30 - 60 = -30 years old, which is not possible. Instead, we need to consider the correct time frame.

Given the correct time frame, we can conclude that Bill was 30 - 60 = -30 years old, which is not possible. Instead, we need to consider the correct time frame.

Therefore, Bill was 30 - 60 = -30 years old, which is not possible. Instead, we need to consider the correct time frame.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
   - Number of electric bill checks per year = 12 checks

2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
   - Number of gas bill checks per year = 12 checks

3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month.
   - Number of church checks per year = 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months).
   - Number of pest and lawn service checks per year = 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Total number of checks per year = 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service)
- Total number of checks per year = 52 checks

The final numerical answer is:
52"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his mother and father, and then subtract this from the total cost of the trousers.

1. The cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, we add the money given by his mother and father:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

Next, we subtract the total amount of money given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \( A = 3 \).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \( B = 4 \).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we calculate the total age of the children:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:

"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

The total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer will donate:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer will contribute \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"To determine how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.
3. Calculate the number of people in the church next door based on the number of cookies given.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.**

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.**

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door.
\[
\text{Cookies given to the church} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church next door.**

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.
\[
\text{Number of people in the church} = \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people}
\]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the proportion of the watermelon that each adult and each child receives, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Let the volume of each child's slice be \( x \). Then, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:

\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume of the watermelon \( V \) is equal to \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the watermelon each adult gets. Since there are 2 adults and each adult's slice is \( 2x \), the total volume of the slices for the adults is:

\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is:

\[ \frac{4x}{8x} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on each activity.

1. **Time spent at the clinic**: 9 hours.
2. **Time spent on rounds**: 20 minutes per inpatient, and there are 9 inpatients.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} \times 9 \text{ inpatients} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting 180 minutes to hours:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Time spent on appointments**: 30 minutes per appointment, and there are 10 appointments.
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes/appointment} \times 10 \text{ appointments} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting 300 minutes to hours:
   \[
   300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Next, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours he has at the clinic:
\[
9 \text{ hours} - 17 \text{ hours} = -8 \text{ hours}
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Doctor Jones does not have enough time to complete all his activities within the 9 hours he has at the clinic. Therefore, the number of hours left to update his records is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]"
"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to find the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter combined.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Adding these together gives:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed costs and the variable costs.

1. **Fixed Costs**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Costs**: The cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed and variable costs, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented for 3 * 4 = 12 sessions in a month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40 * 12 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m \).

We are given:
- Peter has 64 chocolate bars, so \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 56 chocolate bars, so \( 7m = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( p \):
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ p = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( m \):
\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, we need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many babies are born in a year. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, each female porcupine will give birth to:

\[
4 \text{ babies/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ babies/year}
\]

Since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
30 \text{ females} \times 48 \text{ babies/female/year} = 1440 \text{ babies/year}
\]

To find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we add the number of babies born to the original population:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 \text{ original porcupines} + 1440 \text{ babies} = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

Calculate the product:
\[ V = 14 \times 25 = 350 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( V_{\text{gallons}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Calculate the product:
\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

Now, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Calculate the product:
\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.20 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"

   \text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance traveled by Shandy} - \text{Distance traveled by Matteo} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To determine the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

The total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after the next 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So,
\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.535 \]

We know that:
\[ 0.535 \times C = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.535} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.524 \) or 52.4%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.
3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.**

The cost of the car is $10000. Therefore, 20% of $10000 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2000.

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \times 40 + 15 \times 40 = 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, Janet earns $1000 per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000.**

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.50 each = 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.50 each = 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits he has already bought, he has:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the number of pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value of the price.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Albums**: She divided these pictures into 8 albums.
3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 albums were for selfies only.
   - 2 albums were for portraits only.
   - The remaining albums were for other categories.

First, calculate the number of albums that were not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pictures were placed in the selfies and portraits albums. Since the problem does not specify the distribution of pictures among the selfies and portraits albums, we assume that the remaining 3 albums are split between selfies and portraits.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of selfies.
- \( P \) as the number of portraits.

We know:
\[ S + P = 72 \]

Given that 3 albums are for selfies and portraits, and assuming an equal distribution (since no other information is provided), we can split these 3 albums equally:
\[ \text{Number of selfies in 3 albums} = \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ \text{Number of portraits in 3 albums} = \frac{3}{2} \]

Since the number of pictures must be an integer, we need to adjust our assumption. Let's assume the distribution is as follows:
- 2 albums for selfies.
- 1 album for portraits.

This gives us:
\[ S = 2 \times \text{pictures per album for selfies} \]
\[ P = 1 \times \text{pictures per album for portraits} \]

Since the total number of pictures is 72:
\[ 2 \times \text{pictures per album for selfies} + 1 \times \text{pictures per album for portraits} = 72 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of pictures per album for selfies and \( y \) be the number of pictures per album for portraits. We have:
\[ 2x + y = 72 \]

Given the distribution:
\[ 2x = \text{pictures in 2 albums for selfies} \]
\[ y = \text{pictures in 1 album for portraits} \]

Since the problem does not specify the exact distribution, we can assume the simplest case where the distribution is equal:
\[ x = y \]

Thus:
\[ 2x + x = 72 \]
\[ 3x = 72 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

Therefore:
\[ S = 2x = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
\[ P = y = 24 \]

So, the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded are:
\[ \boxed{48 \text{ selfies and } 24 \text{ portraits}} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Thus, the current number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"To determine the total number of bananas John picks, we need to calculate the number of bananas picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the quiz into its components and calculate the number of questions she is sure to answer correctly.

1. **Total number of questions:**
   \[
   60 \text{ questions}
   \]

2. **Number of easy questions:**
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ easy questions}
   \]

3. **Number of average and difficult questions:**
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ questions}
   \]
   Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ average questions}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ difficult questions}
   \]

4. **Aries's performance on easy questions:**
   \[
   75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct}

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{number of large stuffed animals sold} \times \text{price of a large stuffed animal}) + (\text{number of small stuffed animals sold} \times \text{price of a small stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Adding these together:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Thus, the family eats a total of 77 sandwiches in one week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 77 \]"

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day.
3. Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one month.

**Step 1: Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.**

- A dwarf with a bare hand mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
- A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines twice as much as a dwarf with a bare hand, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day.**

- Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.
- Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes will mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one month.**

- There are 30 days in the month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price should be the same for all packages.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of the third package} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60

3. **Extension Requests:**
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension, there's a 20% or 0.20 chance Marcus can convince the teacher to accept his dog-ate-my-homework excuse.
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.48
   - The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 60% or 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum up the probabilities of all scenarios where Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- Substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting an extension: 48% or 0.48
- Normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting an extension: 12% or 0.12

Total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.48 + 0.12 = 1.10 \]

Since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we recognize that the sum of 1.10 represents the total probability of the scenarios where Marcus will have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 110\% \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we conclude that the correct interpretation is that the scenarios overlap, and the actual probability is the sum of the non-overlapping parts, which is 100%.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of available seats for guests is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to split these 5750 available seats equally among the graduates. There are 950 graduates, so each graduate will receive:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"To determine how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate her total earnings from the jury duty.
3. Calculate her total expenses for parking.
4. Determine her net earnings after expenses.
5. Calculate her earnings per hour after expenses.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.**

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her total earnings from the jury duty.**

Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate her total expenses for parking.**

Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine her net earnings after expenses.**

Subtract the total parking expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate her earnings per hour after expenses.**

Divide her net earnings by the total number of hours spent on jury duty:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is given by the total width divided by the spacing between bottles:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The total time is the number of intervals multiplied by the time per interval:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To determine the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
2. Determine how many packs can be made from the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples. Since Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 apples each can be made from 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Next, we add the costs of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount of money:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he borrowed and the total income he lost.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed:
- Jim took 4 years to finish college.
- He borrowed $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total amount borrowed is:
  \[
  4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim lost while in school:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 annual income.
- After college, his income tripled, so his new income is:
  \[
  3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \text{ per year}
  \]
- The income lost per year is:
  \[
  \$75,000 - \$25,000 = \$50,000 \text{ per year}
  \]
- Over 4 years, the total income lost is:
  \[
  4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000
  \]

Now, we add the total amount borrowed and the total income lost:
\[
\$200,000 \text{ (loans)} + \$200,000 \text{ (lost income)} = \$400,000
\]

Finally, we need to determine how long it would take Jim to earn $400,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year:
\[
\frac{\$400,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 5.33 years to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income lost while in school.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5.33}

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total number of square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.**

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.

First, calculate one-fifth of the Monday's deliveries:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Then, add 17 to this amount:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 102.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then, add 5 to this amount:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 209.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.**

Sum the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
\[
425 + 102 + 209
\]

First, add 425 and 102:
\[
425 + 102 = 527
\]

Then, add 209 to this sum:
\[
527 + 209 = 736
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{736}

"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then sum them up.

For the chicken salad:
- Number of people: 10
- Cost per person: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 * $6.50 = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we sum the total costs for both salads:
- Total cost = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to this, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars. Therefore, he did not lose any money in the second race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, we sum up the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average amount lost} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

"To determine the total population of South America, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of cities in South America:**
   - There are 26 countries in South America.
   - Each country has 5 cities.
   - Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
     \[
     26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total population:**
   - Each city has 1000 people living in it.
   - There are 130 cities in South America.
   - Therefore, the total population is:
     \[
     130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people}
     \]

Thus, the total population of South America is:

"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.**

There are 3 weeks of work, and each week has 7 days. Therefore, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.**

Each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all painters in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.**

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{\frac{63}{8} \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = \frac{63}{8 \times 4} \text{ hours/painter} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours/painter} \]

To convert \(\frac{63}{32}\) hours into a decimal:
\[ \frac{63}{32} \approx 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours of work each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{63}{32}} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms again:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means that each year the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = 20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 - 0.21) = (20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79^2 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 - 0.21) = (20000 \times 0.79^2) \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, we calculate \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.627441 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.627441 = 12548.82 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{12548.82} \]"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can follow these steps:

2. Calculate the number of German books:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - \text{Number of English books} - \text{Number of German books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20.

\[

"To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Here's the calculation:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, we know that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. So, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)) board the train.
   \[

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \, \text{tiles} \times \$12 \, \text{per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after an accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the increased monthly cost.**

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we need to find 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

**Step 2: Determine the annual cost.**

To find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of loads for twin beds:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds.
   - Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of loads for the king size bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per week:**
   - Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
   - Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads

4. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total loads per year = Loads per week × Weeks per year
   - Total loads per year = 3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:
\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then extend that to four weekends.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   Jill and her friends watch 4 movies on Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he collected each year and add them to the number he had two years ago.

1. **Two years ago**: Leo had 100 stickers.
2. **Last year**: Leo collected 50 stickers.
3. **This year**: Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum up the stickers from each year:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all the cats.
2. Determine how many days the total amount of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much cat food the cats consume in one day. Since each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

With 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days 720 grams of cat food will last is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we start by defining the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so \( B = J + 3 \). Since \( B = 10 \), we can find \( J \) as follows:
  \[
  10 = J + 3 \implies J = 10 - 3 = 7
  \]
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so \( S = 2J \). Since \( J = 7 \), we can find \( S \) as follows:
  \[
  S = 2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

Now, we sum the slices eaten by each person:
\[
B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31
\]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the visit, the cast, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by the number of work days in a week.

First, we know that James gets 80 emails a day and 20% of these emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes visited as on Monday.
   \[
   2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ classes}
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes visited as on Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 32 = 96 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[
20 - 14 = 6
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas}
\]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[
40 - 32 = 8
\]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left.

\[
6 + 8 = 14
\]

Thus, the total number of pizzas left is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony is sending.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This leaves:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

So, after Mark ate 4 sandwiches, Sidney had 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. This means the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had is now:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Number of Trucks**: Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery.
2. **Fertiliser per Truck**: Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

First, calculate the total amount of fertiliser initially dispatched:
\[
20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
\]

Next, determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \text{ of 20 trucks} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[
20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Now, calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks:
\[
15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \).

Next, we consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

To find out how many pounds Dennis needs to buy to get 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we can use the following logic:
- For every 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound.
- Therefore, to get 6 pounds, he needs to buy \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ pounds} \).

Now, we calculate the cost for 12 pounds of butter:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for 12 pounds is \( 12 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$48.00 \).

Thus, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The base rental fee for the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. 

The number of additional guests beyond the initial 20 is:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The additional cost for these 21 guests is:

- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party:

- Total cost = Base rental fee + Additional cost
- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Thus, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Thus, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day and then find out how many bananas the third monkey eats.

1. Calculate the number of bananas the first monkey eats each day:
   \[
   \text{First monkey's daily consumption} = 10 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of bananas the second monkey eats each day:
   \[
   \text{Second monkey's daily consumption} = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption by first two monkeys} = 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

4. Calculate the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day:
   \[
   \text{Third monkey's daily consumption} = 315 - 24 = 291 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{291}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens of roses Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost as follows:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{15}{12} \right\rceil = 2 \text{ dozens} \]
So, the cost for 2 dozens of roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she is short:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive in change. Since $5 is equivalent to 20 quarters (because $1 = 4 quarters, so $5 = 20 quarters), Jenny will receive 20 quarters in change.

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\) dollars."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The blueprint requires 200 toothpicks in total. Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of additional toothpicks she needs to save is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation for 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"To find Frankie's score, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the equation based on the relationship between their scores.

Binkie's score is given as 90. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 points more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

First, calculate \(2 \times 90\):

\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, add 15 to 180:

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is:

"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance from home to halfway point: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the first segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance from halfway point back to home: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the second segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Distance from home to the store: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the third segment: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \)

Now, we sum the times for all three segments to find the total time:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each bunch costs $0.80.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Therefore, the total cost if bought individually is:
  \[
  10 \text{ bunches} \times \$0.80 \text{ per bunch} = \$8.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Therefore, the total cost if bought in bunches is:
  \[
  10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00
  \]

"Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Number of Trekking bikes sold: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
   - Number of BMX bikes sold: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - Number of MTB bikes sold: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Price of one Trekking bike: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

3. **Calculate the total earnings from all bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the net number of bales produced or removed each hour and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \).

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \).

3. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales in the field:**
   - The net change is the number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up.
   - Net change = \( 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \).

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the initial number of bales in the field is not specified, but we are only concerned with the net change over the 6-hour period.
   - Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the initial number of bales plus the net change.
   - If we assume the initial number of bales is \( B \), then the number of bales left is \( B + 12 \).

Since the problem does not specify the initial number of bales, the final numerical answer based on the net change is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

"To determine the earnings of the orchard, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of meat.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of meat.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, which is \( \frac{x}{4} \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1080 \]"
"To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of each type of wall.
2. Sum the areas of all the walls to get the total area to be painted.
3. Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the paint.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of each type of wall.**

- North and South walls: Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet.
  \[
  \text{Area of one North/South wall} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet}
  \]
  Since there are two such walls:
  \[
  \text{Total area of North and South walls} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}
  \]

- East and West walls: Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet.
  \[
  \text{Area of one East/West wall} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet}
  \]
  Since there are two such walls:
  \[
  \text{Total area of East and West walls} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet}
  \]

**Step 2: Sum the areas of all the walls to get the total area to be painted.**

\[
\text{Total area} = 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.**

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. Therefore, the number of gallons needed is:
\[
\text{Number of gallons} = \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the paint.**

Each gallon of paint costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \times 12 = 144
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Number of shaken sodas left: 2
   - Total number of sodas left: 4
   - Probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda: \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train.
   - Therefore, the speed of the second train is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - For the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - For the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two quantities.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

\[
12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

Now, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

The time \( t_1 \) to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_1 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

The time \( t_2 \) to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_2 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \). According to the problem, 40% of \( N \) is equal to 240 boys. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we need to solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Performing the division:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls in the school, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - \text{Number of boys} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

Then, we determine the number of heels:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Number of heels}} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.
5. Find the difference between the required daily miles and the planned daily miles.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of days in June.**

June has 30 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**

Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.**

To find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day, we divide the total number of miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 5: Find the difference between the required daily miles and the planned daily miles.**

Soledad needs to hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time. She plans to hike 250 miles per day. The difference is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

Next, let's account for the additional fish Tate buys.

**Additional fish:**
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase.

**Total counts after purchase:**
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we find the total number of male and female fish.

**Total number of male fish:**
\[ 6 \text{ (male guppies)} + 5 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 11 \]

**Total number of female fish:**
\[ 8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16 \]

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of female fish and male fish.

Thus, Tate has \(\boxed{5}\) more female fish than male fish."
"Let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's chore**: Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.
2. **Megan's chore**: Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Dior's chore**: Doing laundry took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. For the sake of calculation, let's assume Dior's chore took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption that is more than 8 hours).

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 12 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[
\text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
\]

According to the problem, this total distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we have:
\[
70 \text{ miles} = 2B
\]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The total production rate is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for a 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs and then sum them with Kory's dog.

First, we know Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we sum the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} + \text{Weight of Kory's dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds}

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&M in ounces. John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M contains 30 M&M's. Therefore, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it takes Alfie to fly that distance.

First, we calculate half of the circumference of the earth:
\[
\text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance Alfie flies per day:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the current age of Vince as \( V \).

Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince at that time. So, two years ago, Vince's age was \( V - 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2 \times (V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7 = V - 2 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9 = V \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \).

We are given that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can substitute this value back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined monthly salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined monthly salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk and then sum these times.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ miles} \div v \]
From this, we can solve for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on both segments to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has already saved.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount, given that she saves $4 each week.

First, we calculate how much Jane has already saved:
\[ \text{Amount saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week:
\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is 26.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After this, he is able to drink the water, meaning the temperature of the water in his water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \). After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the temperature of the water in the second mug becomes \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (assuming the second mug originally had 5 ounces of water, and we are considering the average temperature per ounce).

The temperature of the water in the water bottle after the pourings is a weighted average of the temperatures of the water from the two mugs. Since we don't know the exact amount of water in the second mug, we can assume it's large enough that the temperature of the water in the second mug after pouring 1 ounce is still relevant. The temperature of the water in the water bottle is thus:

\[ \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times \frac{T}{5}}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + \frac{T}{5}}{5} = \frac{132}{5} + \frac{T}{25} = 26.4 + \frac{T}{25} \]

We know this temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ 26.4 + \frac{T}{25} \geq 40 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ \frac{T}{25} \geq 40 - 26.4 \]
\[ \frac{T}{25} \geq 13.6 \]
\[ T \geq 13.6 \times 25 \]
\[ T \geq 340 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 340 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{340} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Melanie's father starts with 50 cows.
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

The number of cows added in three weeks is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

The number of chickens added in three weeks is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Cows added: 420
- Total cows: \( 50 + 420 = 470 \)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Chickens added: 210
- Total chickens: \( 20 + 210 = 230 \)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 1 less than 3 scoops is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first establish the probabilities of each ticket being a winner.

1. The probability of the first ticket being a winner is given as 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket being a winner is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket being a winner. This is because the events are independent.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in each color:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
3. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
4. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we'll determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard by subtracting the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
2. Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.
3. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.
4. Calculate John's weekly earnings based on the number of collections and the payment per collection.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.**

Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
\[ 200 \text{ apartments/complex} \times 2 \text{ complexes} = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined total of the first two complexes.
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ additional apartments} \]
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} + 240 \text{ apartments} = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.**

John collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week.
\[ 640 \text{ apartments/complex} + 400 \text{ apartments/complex} = 1040 \text{ apartments/week} \]
\[ 1040 \text{ apartments/week} \times 3 \text{ collections/week} = 3120 \text{ collections/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate John's weekly earnings.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
\[ 3120 \text{ collections/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we calculate:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Finally, we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left after giving \(x\) dollars to her sister:**
   \[
   15 - 3 = 12
   \]

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left after giving \(x\) dollars to her sister:**
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

It is also given that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values and relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we can find the total area of the house by summing the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:

"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box of dishwasher pods, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12.
   - The new box contains 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles that can be run for $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

"First, we determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals Scored by Each Team:**
   - Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
   - Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

4. **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by Team A and Team B, which is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
3. Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of girls on varsity. There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's find the number of boys on varsity. There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[
\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 12 + 12 = 24
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[
\boxed{17}

3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned due to expiry.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the refund amount is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books he can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

So, Bob can buy 54 books with $27,000. Since he has to distribute this amount among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\frac{54}{3} = 18
\]

Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school. The final numerical answer is:

\[
18

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends and then figure out how many whole pizzas are required to meet this demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many whole cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices by the number of slices per cheese pizza: \(36 \text{ slices} \div 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Next, we determine how many whole pizzas are required for the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza: \(24 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Since both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 whole pizzas, Kate needs to buy:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] pizzas."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 19."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine Jim's current age, we start by understanding the relationship between John's and Jim's ages when Digimon came out. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.

Given:
- John's current age is 28 years.

Let's denote Jim's current age as \( J \).

When Digimon came out:
- John's age = 28 years
- Jim's age = \( J \) years

According to the problem, at that time, John's age was twice Jim's age:
\[ 28 = 2J \]

To find Jim's age \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = \frac{28}{2} \]
\[ J = 14 \]

Thus, Jim's current age is 14 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"To determine the total number of apple slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces.
2. Doxa ate 1 slice.
3. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
4. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, we sum the slices eaten by each of them:
- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 3 slices.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a bulk pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages. This means they had 78 bandages after using 25 bandages, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.
- Her weekly earnings = 6 days/week * $11.25/day = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, her total earnings for April are:
- Total earnings for April = 4 weeks * $67.50/week = $270.00

Additionally, Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for April, she receives this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Total attendance bonus for April = 4 weeks * $10/week = $40.00

Finally, her total earnings for April, including the bonus, are:
- Total earnings for April = $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00

"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to sum up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice this number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all these numbers to get the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk per day, we can use the information given about the average distance walked by all 4 dogs.

The total average distance walked by the 4 dogs per day is 3 miles. The distances walked by the first three dogs are 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles respectively. Let's denote the distance walked by the last dog as \( x \) miles.

The total distance walked by all 4 dogs per day is the sum of the distances walked by each dog:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 3 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ 8 + x = 3 \]
\[ x = 3 - 8 \]
\[ x = -5 \]

However, a negative distance doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be an inconsistency in the problem statement or the interpretation of the average distance. Given the problem constraints, the only logical conclusion is that the distance for the last dog must be 5 miles to satisfy the average distance of 3 miles per day.

So, the last dog needs to walk 5 miles per day.

"To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas.
2. Determine the total cost of the tunas.
3. Calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the tunas. Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total cost is:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]
   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 1 liter
   - Duration: 3 days
   - Total water removed: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \)

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Water removed per day: \( 2 \times 1 \, \text{liter/day} = 2 \, \text{liters/day} \)
   - Duration: 3 days
   - Total water removed: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \)

3. **High setting:**
   - Water removed per day: \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{liters/day} = 4 \, \text{liters/day} \)
   - Duration: 5 days
   - Total water removed: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \)

Now, we sum the total water removed over all settings:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know the total number of hours he travels. Assuming he travels every day without stopping, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of hours he travels each day, we assume he travels for 24 hours each day (a full day). Therefore, in 3 days, he travels:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that 3600 km represents:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline.
2. Calculate the number of grapes used by her brother.
3. Determine the number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used their grapes.
4. Calculate the number of grapes used to make the pies.
5. Determine the total number of grapes at the beginning.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.
4. The number of grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother used their grapes is \(x - 36\), where \(x\) is the total number of grapes at the beginning.
5. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used to make the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
6. Since the remaining grapes are used to make the pies, we have \(x - 36 = 48\).

Now, we solve for \(x\):

\[x - 36 = 48\]
\[x = 48 + 36\]
\[x = 84\]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(\boxed{84}\)."

   - Capacity of the top shelf: \( 20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books} \).

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Total capacity of one bookcase: \( 20 \text{ (middle)} + 20 \text{ (bottom)} + 15 \text{ (top)} = 55 \text{ books} \).

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - Number of bookcases required: \( \frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books/bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases} \).

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all 110 books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The cost of the eggs is $2.40 per dozen. Since she bought five dozens, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue Rose will get from selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollar per egg} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100$ cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey gets 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

Next, we need to find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement for the total number of questions. The second test has 40 questions, so she needs to answer 70% of 40 questions correctly:
\[ 40 \times 0.70 = 28 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach a total of 28 correct answers. She has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, but since we are only concerned with the second test, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach 28 correct answers. Since she has already exceeded the required 28 correct answers on the first test, she needs to get:
\[ 28 - 0 \text{ (since she already has more than 28 correct answers)} = 28 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 28 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be expressed as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. This can be expressed as:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each component step by step.

1. **Number of Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room. Since there are 8 rooms, there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms, so there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each.
   - The total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Number of Candles and Flashlights:**

"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to find out how many robots, helmets, and footballs are present in the changing room. We know from the problem statement that there are 20 helmets and that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs.

First, let's find the number of robots. Since there are 20 helmets and the number of robots is half the number of helmets:
\[
\text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, let's find the number of footballs. Since the number of helmets is half the number of footballs:
\[
\text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[

   The number of people on the third day was twice the number that were there on the second day.
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140
   \]
   So, 140 people were present on the third day.

4. **Average for the Rest of the Week:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Total Number of People for the Rest of the Week:**
   Since there are 3 days left in the week and the average is 60 people per day:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
   So, 180 people were present on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days combined.

6. **Total Number of People for the Week:**
   Adding the number of people from all days:
   \[
   50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440
   \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \(\boxed{440}\)."
"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then sum them up, including the additional kernels that popped due to residual heat.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: 20

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that popped: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\)

After the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop due to residual heat:
   - Additional kernels that pop due to residual heat: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:
   - First 30 seconds: 20
   - Next 30 seconds: 60
   - Next 30 seconds: 80
   - Final 30 seconds: 40
   - Residual heat: 10

Total number of popped kernels:

   - Total lemon juice needed = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon.
   - Total lemon juice needed = \(4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - Each lemon yields 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of lemon juice, Tim needs 6 lemons.

The total number of lemons Tim needs is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then extend that to a weekly total.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, let's find the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
- The total daily consumption is \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- The total weekly consumption is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 to get the number of pairs.

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:

"To determine the number of red blocks, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let:
- \( B \) be the number of blue blocks.
- \( Y \) be the number of yellow blocks.
- \( R \) be the number of red blocks.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of blue blocks \( B = 4 \).
- The number of yellow blocks \( Y = 2 \times B = 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can express the total number of blocks as:
\[ B + Y + R = 32 \]

Substituting the known values of \( B \) and \( Y \) into the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the number of red blocks is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, determine the net distance from his starting point:
- The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store offers a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. This means that for every two T-shirts, Jake pays full price for one and 50% of the price for the other.

The cost for the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost for the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is $4.

So, the total cost for the 2 T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]

So, the sale price of the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Now, we sum the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide $13 by $6.50:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \text{ (with a remainder of 0.30)} \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, he can buy 2 movie tickets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in total, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate Ellen's total spending:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
- Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Next, let's calculate Lani's total spending:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so $100 * 2 = $200
- Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals to find the overall amount spent:
- Total spent: $105 (Ellen) + $230 (Lani) = $335

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{335}

"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

Thus, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.

"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Calculate the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Calculate his earnings over 2 weeks.

First, let's determine the number of days Josh is open in a week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ days per week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, we calculate his earnings over 2 weeks:

"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Test Tubes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Petri Dishes:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Beakers:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7 beakers.

4. **Total Items Placed on the Lab Bench:**
   - Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor should have placed on the lab bench:
- Test tubes: 8
- Petri dishes: 16
- Beakers: 7

Summing these up:
\[ 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost some items. Let's determine how many beakers he lost.

Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench can be expressed as:
\[ 8 + 16 + (7 - x) = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 24 + 7 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws he has.

First, we calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
- Each table has 4 legs.
- James is putting together 4 tables.

\[
\text{Total number of legs} = 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs}
\]

Next, we determine the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
- Each leg needs 2 screws.

\[
\text{Total number of screws needed} = 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws}
\]

James has 40 screws. We now find out how many screws he will have left over by subtracting the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:

\[
\text{Screws left over} = 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}

"To find the total amount of money raised by Kim, Alexandra, Maryam, and Sarah, we need to calculate the amount each person raised individually and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Alexandra raised $430. Let's denote the amount raised by Alexandra as \( A \). So, we have:
\[ A = 430 \]

Next, we know that Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. Let's denote the amount raised by Kim as \( K \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ K = A + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Now, we know that Sarah raised $300. Let's denote the amount raised by Sarah as \( S \). So, we have:
\[ S = 300 \]

We also know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. Let's denote the amount raised by Maryam as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = S + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money raised by adding the amounts raised by Kim, Alexandra, Maryam, and Sarah:
\[ \text{Total} = K + A + M + S = 750 + 430 + 700 + 300 = 2180 \]

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:
\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times \text{Time Aaron took} = A \times 16 \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute and he took 16 minutes, we have:
\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so:
\[ \text{Distance Vanessa ran} = 2 \times D_A = 2 \times (A \times 16) = 32A \]

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we have:
\[ 32A = 4 \]
\[ A = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can find Vanessa's speed \( V \):
\[ V = \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

To find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we use her speed:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Speed Vanessa}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed for the dock:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line the caretaker already has:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 594 \]"

"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price.
   - The cost price (CP) of the watermelons is $80.
   - The profit (P) is 25% of $80.
   - Calculate the profit: \( P = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \) dollars.
   - The total selling price (SP) is the cost price plus the profit: \( SP = CP + P = 80 + 20 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - The vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100.
   - The selling price per watermelon (SP per watermelon) is the total selling price divided by the number of watermelons: \( SP \text{ per watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \) dollars.

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Ana spends 3 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
