"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after eating three for breakfast and using four for baking muffins.

Total eggs laid per day: 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
Eggs used for baking muffins: 4

Total eggs used: 3 + 4 = 7

Eggs remaining for sale: 16 - 7 = 9

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

Total earnings per day: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

\[
\boxed{18}

"To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber and then sum them up.

Given:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

First, calculate the amount of white fiber:
\[ \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Next, sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
\[ \text{Total bolts} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then adds $50,000 in repairs, making the total cost of the house and repairs $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000. \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000. \]

The profit Josh makes is the new value of the house minus the original cost of the house and the repairs:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000. \]

So, the profit Josh made is $195,000. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total meters run in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters run in one session:**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs. Therefore, the total meters run in one session is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters/session}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters run in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week. Therefore, the total meters run in one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. With a flock of 20 chickens, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total feed in morning and afternoon} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[
\text{Total feed in morning and afternoon} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Since the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, the remaining amount of feed needed for the final meal is:

\[
\text{Remaining feed} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break down the cost for every two glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for all 16 glasses. We can see that for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs of glasses. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

So, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by determining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Restart due to Windows updates:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Resuming the download from the beginning:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (since 80 GB have already been downloaded).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% of the download: 40 minutes
- Time for the restart: 20 minutes
- Time to download the remaining 120 GB: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining = 4 hours - 3 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 0.5 hours.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 0.5 hours = 40 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
- Distance covered in the first segment: 180 miles.
- Distance covered in the third segment: 15 miles.
- Distance covered in the fourth segment: 40 miles.

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 15 miles + 40 miles = 235 miles.

The final numerical answer is:
235 miles"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the regular 40 hours. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the pastries:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this:

- She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
- She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
- She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is indeed 5, our solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:

2. Calculate the number of remaining students after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 60\% \]

The final numerical answer is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates and then compare the profit from each plan.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value * (1 + growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value * (1 + growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Next, we calculate the profit for each plan:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}

\]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

The final numerical answer is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs used per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: For 4 weeks, the number of eggs used is:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs used in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired = 3 hours
   - Remaining time = Total time desired - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the water from both drinks:
- Total water from orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- Total water from pineapple drink: 9 liters.
- Total water in the combined mixture: \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture is reduced by 1 liter:
- New total volume: \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters.

However, we need to find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture. Since the total amount of water remains the same (because we are only redistributing the mixture, not adding or removing water), the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is still \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters.

To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to determine the proportion of the total mixture that 24 liters represents. The total volume of the mixture after the spill is 9 liters, and we need to find the fraction of the total mixture that 24 liters represents:
- Fraction of the mixture: \( \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3} \).

Since the total amount of water is \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
- Amount of water in 24 liters: \( \frac{8}{3} \times \frac{47}{3} = \frac{376}{9} \) liters.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{376}{9}}

- The last 3 customers did not buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Adding these together gives the total number of DVDs sold:
\[3 + 4 + 0 = 7\]

So, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total burning time and then use the rate of melting to find the total length lost.

1. Calculate the total burning time:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total length lost:
   - Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, over 4 hours, the total length lost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}
     \]

Thus, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

\[
\boxed{8}

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered as \( x \). The cost of \( x \) boxes of pizza is:
\[ 8.50x \]

The total cost of all items is given as $50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides:
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Divide both sides by 8.50:
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{243}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \). So, the second friend's guess is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \( \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20 \). So, the third friend's guess is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we sum up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

To find the average guess, we divide the total sum by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total hours John spends on one dog per day.
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

2. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day.
   - Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total hours per day is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

3. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per week.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the total hours per week is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is 35 hours.

\[
\boxed{35}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This will help us determine how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy. 

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. Therefore, the total cost for 15 packs is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ dollars/pack} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games to the money he has left.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that John made $195 from selling his lego sets. To find out how much money he spent, we subtract the money he has left from the total money he made.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 190 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John spent $165 on video games, we can confirm that the remaining $25 is the money he has left.

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he has 0 lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To find John's running speed, we need to determine the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running.

First, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. So, the distance he runs each day is:

\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he runs each of the other two days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the distance he runs on the other two days is:

\[ \text{Distance on other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since he runs 20 miles in the 1.5 hours on the other two days, his speed on those days is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = \frac{20}{1.5} = \frac{20 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John's speed is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{40}{3}} \text{ miles/hour} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age:**

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. The daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories:

\[ \text{Calories left for the day} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories:

\[ \text{Servings that can be consumed} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 500 grams (because a 300g bag has 5 servings):

\[ \text{Grams that can be consumed} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 500 \text{ grams per serving} = 2000 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \text{ grams} \]"
"First, let's determine how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To determine how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of post-it notes used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of post-it notes before the purchase.
3. Calculate the number of post-it notes purchased.
4. Determine the number of post-it notes in the package purchased.

First, Candice used 220 post-it notes at work. She had 23 post-it notes remaining after this. Therefore, the total number of post-it notes she had before leaving the store was:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Initially, she had 80 post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of post-it notes she had before leaving the store can be expressed as:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. This can be calculated by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

3/4 of the building is occupied. Therefore, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

The number of unoccupied units is the total number of units minus the number of occupied units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem into parts to find the time it takes for Tom to travel back.

First, we need to determine the distance Tom traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM), the distance he traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom needs to travel back the same 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel back can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time it takes for Tom to get back is 5 hours. The final numerical answer is:

\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, her pension for the first 20 years is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is:
     \[
     10 \times (0.05 \times 1,000,000) = 10 \times 50,000 = 500,000
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension after 30 years is the sum of the pension for the first 20 years and the pension for the next 10 years:
     \[
     1,000,000 + 500,000 = 1,500,000
     \]

4. **Annual pension after 30 years:**
   - Since she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years, her annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,500,000 = 75,000
     \]

Thus, her annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{75000}\)."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less in the second half of the year.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Subtract this 10% from the original monthly charge to get the reduced monthly charge:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Also, the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost (\( L = 7 \)), we can find the number of games they won (\( W \)):
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**: 
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

6. **Salary Increase for the Third Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8000} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests who will attend is:

\[
\text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:

\[
\text{Total number of gift bags} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9
\]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18
\]

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both adults and children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets} \]

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:
\[ 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \) (since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson).
- Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) (since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey is 2 years older than Amy).
- James' age is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is 11.

From the information given, we know Corey's age is 11. Therefore, we can set up the equation for Corey's age:

\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine the original time for Gerald:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:
   \[
   38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement:**
   Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means his new time is 90% of his original time. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{New time} = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"Let's denote the number of dogs as \(D\), the number of cats as \(C\), and the number of rabbits as \(R\).

Given:
- The number of dogs \(D = 60\).
- The number of cats \(C = 2D\).
- The number of rabbits \(R = D - 12\).

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ R = D - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 48 = 228 \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[ \boxed{228} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the potted plants she will give away. Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving away 40 plants, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

Average pages per day = Remaining pages / Number of days left
Average pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday). Since he drinks one glass of water with each meal, and he has three meals a day, he drinks \(3\) glasses of water per day on weekdays. Therefore, for \(5\) weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he drinks \(0\) glasses of water on each of the two weekend days. Therefore, for \(2\) weekend days, he drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 0 \text{ glasses} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

Here's the breakdown of the hours he watched TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. So, the number of cookies he actually baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate together:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore. Since 64 seconds is the time it takes to row to the shore, we can calculate the distance she rows in that time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on in 80 feet, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts is sugar. Since sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the fraction of the total used for sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\).

We can now calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total amount of sugar and water by the fraction that represents the sugar:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 120 \times \frac{7}{20} = 120 \times 0.35 = 42
\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92.

\[
\boxed{99076.92}

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of sheets of paper used per week.
2. Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Therefore, the number of sheets of paper used per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets of paper he uses in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sheets of paper used per month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought. 

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits brought by each person.

Morisette's total fruits:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits} \]

Kael's total fruits:
\[ 10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits} \]

Finally, we add the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:
\[ 13 \text{ fruits} + 14 \text{ fruits} = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after running for 3 hours. Since she has a total of 7 hours available:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

First, we know that Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters are now stamped and added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

We are also told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since 20 of these are the newly stamped letters, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters that were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   Given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - **Watermelons:**
     Dillon buys 4 watermelons.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Peppers:**
     Dillon buys 20 peppers.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Oranges:**
     Dillon buys 10 oranges.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times \text{Cost of an orange} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Amount Spent:**
   Adding up the costs for all the fruits:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Total cost for watermelons} + \text{Total cost for peppers} + \text{Total cost for oranges} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\) dollars."
"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours).

Total patient hours per day:
\[ 500 \text{ people} \times 0.4 \text{ hours/person} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour.
\[ \text{Revenue} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:
- The hospital charges patients $200 per hour.
\[ \text{Cost} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine the hospital's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 30000 \text{ dollars} - 40000 \text{ dollars} = -10000 \text{ dollars} \]

The hospital incurs a loss of $10,000 from these visits. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **Initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.
2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 of the remaining elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's calculate how many questions Mark completed on each test.

For the first test:
- Mark took 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions}\).

For the second test:
- Mark took 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions}\).

Now, we sum the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To find the total cost including tax, we first need to calculate the total cost of the nonfood items and then apply the 10% tax to them.

The nonfood items and their costs are:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3

The total cost of nonfood items is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the nonfood items is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 6 \times 0.10 = 0.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the tax to the total cost of the nonfood items gives:
\[ 6 + 0.60 = 6.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to add the cost of the food items (which have no tax) to the total cost of the nonfood items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the food items to the total cost of the nonfood items gives:

- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each = 2 * $2 = $4
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each = $5

So, the total cost per client is:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

The total expenses for 8 clients are:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many 3-month periods there are in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare and he has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples per harvest} = 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 4 times a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ \text{Total pineapples in a year} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \times 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we sum up the total number of pieces from all three lego sets:

\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Debra sees twice as many bees leave as those that left in the first 6 hours, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) bees.
4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:** All the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods need to return to the hive in the last 6 hours. The total number of bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods is \(30 + 60 = 90\) bees. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6-hour period, the number of bees that still need to return in the last 6 hours is \(90 - 15 = 75\) bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference in their travel times.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their travel times is:
\(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2.50 + \$2.25 + \$0.25 = \$5.00. \]

Thus, the total amount Shawnda made that day is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

\[
10 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants ate 1 final fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38
   \]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 38 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana consumption for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards per round trip. She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Next, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the depth of the water on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months. 
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Each price increase is by 120% of the previous price. This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by 1.20. 

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**: If the initial price is \( P_0 \), after \( n \) increases, the price \( P_n \) is given by:
   \[
   P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n
   \]

6. **Applying the Formula**: Here, \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \):
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

7. **Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

8. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

\[

"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we need to find the cost of one action figure, which is given as $5.

We can now calculate the total value of all the toys:
- The value of the 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The value of the 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The value of the doll is:
\[ 15 \]

Adding these values together gives the total worth of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the missed income from doing freelance work and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income from doing freelance work. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90. Therefore, the additional money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Adding these together:

\[ 157 + 74 + 102 + 102 = 435 \]

Next, we add the cost of the computer itself, which is €1090:

\[ 1090 + 435 = 1525 \]

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

\[ 1500 - 1525 = -25 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Elvira does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the accessories. She will be short by €25.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, we know that each flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation \( S = 2B \):

\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance, taking into account that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

First, let's calculate the miles he walks from Monday to Friday:
- There are 5 weekdays.
- He walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
- Total miles from Monday to Friday = 5 days * 20 miles/day = 100 miles.

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on the weekend:
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- He walks 10 miles each day on the weekend.
- Total miles on the weekend = 2 days * 10 miles/day = 20 miles.

Now, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekend to get the total miles for the week:
- Total miles in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekend) = 120 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The total cost of each uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four} + \text{Age of the Caboose}
\]

Since the problem states there are four birds at the Caboose and we don't have any specific information about the age of the Caboose, we assume the Caboose is a placeholder for the total age of the other three birds. Therefore, the total age of the four birds is the sum of the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four.

\[
\text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 = 43
\]

So, the total age of the four birds is 43."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Profit per gallon is:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:

"To find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to determine how many crabs each of them has individually and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. We can denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). Therefore,
\[ B = 40 \]

Next, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore,
\[ M = B - 4 \]
Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore,
\[ R = M + 10 \]
Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have:
\[ R + M + B = 46 + 36 + 40 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 46 + 36 = 82 \]
\[ 82 + 40 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to find out how many votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 200 = 5w \]
Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]
So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is:
\[ 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in their total times:
- Difference = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is given as 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader makes a profit of $400 after selling all the bags. The profit can be calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on each of the 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost for rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid $34.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect in 3 hours, given that he collects 2 peaches per minute.

First, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount of insects needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We do this by multiplying the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Net increase in trees each year**
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die**
Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, the number of trees he will have is:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years**
30% of the trees die after 10 years. Therefore, the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years**
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of flamingos on Friday morning:** 18 pink flamingos.

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the prank on Saturday morning:**
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

4. **On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

5. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

6. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards:**
   To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we sum the cards collected each month and add the initial number of cards.

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives the total amount Mark earns in a week:

   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is:

- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- There are 80 candied apples.

First, calculate the weight of one candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of one chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2600 \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup and then the total cost of buying twenty dozen cups.

First, let's find out how many plates are sold at $6000 each. Since half a dozen plates is 6 plates, the total cost for 6 plates is $6000. Therefore, the cost of one plate is:
\[
\text{Cost of one plate} = \frac{6000}{6} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is 6 plates. The total cost for 6 plates is:
\[
\text{Total cost of 6 plates} = 6 \times 1000 = 6000 \text{ dollars}
\]

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since half a dozen plates cost $6000, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[
\text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:
\[
\text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{4800}{240} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn. She earns $5 each time she babysits and has babysat 4 times, so she earns:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn by \(x\). Then, her total earnings from mowing the lawn will be:
\[ 4x \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn and babysitting is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \text{ dollars} \]

We need this total to be at least equal to the cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know his walking speed is 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and his speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S - 4 \times 4 = S - 16 \) gallons and the big pool had \( B - 4 \times 4 = B - 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amounts of water in the pools are related by the fact that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S - 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

By setting the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other, we get:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ -16 = 2S \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The correct interpretation should be that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool, and the leak has been ongoing for 4 minutes. So, the correct equation should be:
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]

Substituting \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount. 

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. To find the remaining balance, we subtract the amount paid from the total amount promised:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Given that there are 4 roses and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

First, we know Harriet's current age is 21 years. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Next, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can find Adrian's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66
\]
\[
\text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45
\]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages in three years and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points scored by all four students to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Let Jojo's score be \( J \). The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]
6. Solve for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

\[
\boxed{70}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias planted is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of flowers planted by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

In the first year, the company spent $15000 on advertising.

In the second year, the company spent a third of $15000 on advertising. So, the amount spent in the second year is:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent in both years:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

\[
\boxed{20000}

"To find the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- The cost per hour for the canoe is $30.
- Carlos rents the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Carlos is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- The cost per hour for the banana boat raft is $18.
- Benji rents the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Benji is \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is \(\boxed{180}\)."

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards, the number of cards of each type changes as follows:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34 (increased by 14)
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32 (decreased by 8)

So, the total number of cards James has now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions and upgrades:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To determine how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces per minute and then convert that into hours.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add per minute together.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is:
\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Together, they can add:
\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

"First, let's determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after she took the first batch home is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate how many of these were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means that the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars, so the total cost of the cars is:

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Adding the tax to the cost of the cars gives us the total cost before registration fees:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Now, we need to add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark has 12 cars, so the total registration fee is:

\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Adding the registration fees to the total cost before registration fees gives us the final amount Mark has to pay:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is \(25 \times 2 = 50\).

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave. We know there are 36 penguins in total.

First, we calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we find the total number of penguins that have left the snow to either swim or eat dinner:
\[
12 \text{ (jumping into the ocean)} + 12 \text{ (going into the cave)} = 24
\]

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that have left from the total number of penguins:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine how much Steve eats per day. According to the problem, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats:
\[ \text{Girlfriend's daily consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ \text{Steve's weekly consumption} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. The problem states that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide his weekly consumption by the weekly production of one vine:
\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/week/vine}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 14 vines to meet his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices:
\[
20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pizzas are required to get 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions:
\[
\frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses five empty pens to make one new pen, he effectively gains one new pen from the ink of five old pens.

Let's break down the process step by step:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he now has 25 - 5 + 1 = 21 pens.
- Next, he uses another 5 pens to make 1 new pen, so he now has 21 - 5 + 1 = 17 pens.
- He continues this process until he has fewer than 5 pens left.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we divide the number of pens he has by 5:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \]

This means he can make 5 new pens from the 25 pens he initially has. After making these 5 new pens, he will have:

\[ 25 - 5 \times 5 = 25 - 25 = 0 \]

So, he will have 5 new pens plus the 5 pens he used to make them, which totals to:

\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram ends up with is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each girl based on the information given.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we add the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Let's perform the addition:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the following:

- Dolly has 2 books.
- Pandora has 1 book.
- Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
\[3 \text{ (Dolly's books)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's books)} = 6 \text{ books}\]

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he now has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages per week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses in a month:
- Jason has a daily call of 15 minutes with his boss.
- There are 30 days in the month.

So, the total minutes used for daily calls with his boss is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes with other people this month.

Now, add the minutes used for daily calls and the extra minutes:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's total phone plan is 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, subtract the total minutes used from the plan's total:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, after all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).
- This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as \( 2f \) (since there are \( f \) fish in each aquarium).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jean paid.

Final amount paid = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, the final numerical answer is $27,000."

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of cookies each person ate and then calculate the total calories consumed by each. Finally, we will find the difference in calories consumed.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we sum up the cookies eaten by each person over the two days:
- Her sister ate \( 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \( 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \) cookies in total.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Her sister consumed \( 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \) calories.
- Sue consumed \( 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 5040 - 1520 = 3520 \]

So, Sue consumed 3520 more calories than her sister. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3520} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the third class. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes.
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

2. **Total number of girls in the school:**
   The school is 50% girls, so:
   \[
   \text{Total girls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   \]

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.
   \[
   \text{Total girls in first and second classes} = 15 + 12 = 27

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
   \[
   \text{Girls in third class} = 30 - 27 = 3
   \]

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   Each class has 20 students, and since the third class has 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:
   \[
   \text{Boys in third class} = 20 - 3 = 17

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night = 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so he killed \( 3c \) wolves.
   - It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars today.
   - Therefore, \( c = 12 \).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Total animals killed last night = 25.
   - Total animals killed today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.
   - Total animals killed = 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals.

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[
\boxed{84}

"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he now has is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}

So, Brady has a total of **45 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ A_a = 52 \]

From this, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:

\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:

\[ A_{total} = A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

And the total number of fruits Jamal has:

\[ J_{total} = J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ Total_{fruits} = A_{total} + J_{total} = 76 + 92 = 168 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla plans to make 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which totals to:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \text{Cups of flour} = \left(\frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}}\right) \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Cups of flour} = \left(\frac{66}{12}\right) \times 2 = 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, we add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

"To find the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these costs.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

\[
\boxed{762}

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

Next, we add the additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.

So, the total number of windows in one house is:
\[6 \text{ windows (from bedrooms)} + 4 \text{ windows (additional)} = 10 \text{ windows}\]

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
\[10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}\]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how much change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their respective costs are:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
\]

First, add $4.20 and $9.45:

\[
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
\]

Next, add $1.35 to $13.65:

\[
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
\]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
\]

Thus, the change the cashier gives back is:

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the remaining stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of stitches remaining for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stitches per sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{765}\)."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = 20 \times 40 = \$800
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

\[
\text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = 80 \times 30 = \$2400
\]

Now, we add the total costs of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the number of lines in the first scene is:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
   Sean has to memorize a third of the lines in the first scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the number of lines in the second scene is:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60
   \]
   Sean has to memorize four-fifths of the lines in the second scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
   \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   Summing up the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene, we get:

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the time taken to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Time to dig 30 small holes = \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes

Next, we calculate the time taken to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Time to dig 15 large holes = \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes

Now, we sum the time taken for both types of holes:
- Total time = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \)

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."
"Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( m \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, so we can write the equation:

\[ M + m = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( m + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (m + 10) = M + m + 20 \]

Since we know from the initial condition that \( M + m = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + m + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of spots for a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding the total spots for the cobras and mambas gives us the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtract the length used by the topaz gemstones from the total length.

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there is a 30-minute break, we need to subtract this break time from the total working time.

Total working time = 3 hours = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes
Break time = 30 minutes

Time worked = Total working time - Break time = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we need to determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes.

Number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes = 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

Total earnings = Number of intervals * Earnings per interval = 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

The final numerical answer is $75."
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the extra point: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the extra point: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members of the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Assuming the household eats rice every lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Next, we sum the crates sold on these days:
\[
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - The opening bid is $200.
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350.

Carmen wins the auction after her fourth bid. Therefore, the total amount she paid is the sum of her bids:

\[
200 + 250 + 300 + 350
\]

Now, we calculate the sum:

\[
200 + 250 = 450
\]
\[
450 + 300 = 750
\]
\[
750 + 350 = 1100
\]

Thus, the total amount Carmen paid for the desk is:

\[
\boxed{1100}
\]"
"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost is $2 per mile, so the cost for 15000 miles is \(15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- John gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}
\]"
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

According to the problem, Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages from one piece of paper. Therefore, each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16
\]

So, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is 16.

\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, the remaining amount is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books: 250
- Unsold books: 50
- Books sold: 250 - 50 = 200
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books sold in the first year: 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year: 200 - 45 - 90 = 70

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 70 \times 20 = 1400 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1400 \]"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, his total weekly earnings when the company performed well are:

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns his weekly bonus for each full week, we consider only the full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings for the 4 full weeks in April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can find the number of people he beats by calculating 80% of 20.

\[ \text{Number of people John beats} = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

Since John arm wrestles 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beats.

\[ \text{Number of people John loses to} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we calculate how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as follows:

\[
2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses weight at the same rate as Joey (2 pounds per week), the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Thus, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, 5 extra arms grow in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, 3 extra legs grow in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
   \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo wishes to spend is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip, including gifts, is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{\$2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people and their daily egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:**
   - Each of the 3 people eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs consumed by these 3 people per day = \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs/day}\).

3. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:**
   - Each of the 2 people eats 2 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs consumed by these 2 people per day = \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs/day}\).

4. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the entire family:**
   - Total eggs consumed per day = \(9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}\).

5. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total eggs consumed in a week = \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\).

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."

- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\). Then, six years ago, the population was \(P/2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P/2 = 60000\), so \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

The total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Therefore, the number of people who showed up for the party is:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[14\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 30 \).

The number of girls in the classroom is 3 times the number of boys, so the number of girls \( G \) is:
\[ G = 3 \times B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The number of nongendered children \( N \) is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the number of boys, so:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

The total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is \( 123 \)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total number of people at the party.
2. Determine the number of people who left after an hour.
3. Use the information about the number of men who stayed to find the number of women who stayed.
4. Calculate the number of women who left and subtract that from the initial number of women to find the number of women who are left.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Initial total number of people:
   \[
   \text{Initial total} = 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people}
   \]

2. After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people}
   \]

3. Let \(x\) be the number of men who left. Since 22 men stayed, we have:
   \[
   x = 25 - 22 = 3 \text{ men}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of women who left is:
   \[
   10 - 3 = 7 \text{ women}
   \]

4. The number of women who are left is:
   \[
   15 - 7 = 8 \text{ women}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has and then find out how many boxes are needed to store all of them.

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all their pencils, we need to determine the total number of pencils and then divide by the number of pencils each box can hold (which is 8).

The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the two effects separately: the cooling effect and the addition of cream.

1. **Cooling Effect:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes used is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, the total weakening due to the ice cubes is \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters.

2. **Addition of Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The addition of cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

To find the total weakening of the coffee, we add the weakening due to the ice cubes and the weakening due to the cream:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded out is 7. Since each new record traded out corresponds to 2 old records traded in, the total number of old records traded in is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. The final numerical answer is:

14"
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know the monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all junior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[
2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total monthly salary for all senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salaries for junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

\[
\boxed{31}

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. Since the phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, it needs to charge by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge by 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[ \text{Rewards} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer spent $43 on their current shopping trip. They can use the $4 in rewards to reduce the price. So, the price after applying the rewards is:
\[ 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon will take off:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price after applying the coupon is:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
1. Calculate the gross pay: \( 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2000 \text{ hours/year} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \).
2. Calculate the total tax: \( 20\% \times 30000 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \).
3. Calculate the net pay: \( 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars/year} \).

**Job B:**
1. Calculate the gross pay: \( 42000 \text{ dollars/year} \).
2. Calculate the property tax: \( 6000 \text{ dollars} \).
3. Calculate the net income after property tax: \( 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \).
4. Calculate the additional income tax: \( 10\% \times 36000 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \).
5. Calculate the net pay: \( 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars/year} \).

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: \( 24000 \text{ dollars/year} \)
- Job B net pay: \( 32400 \text{ dollars/year} \)

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more per year at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8400} \]"
"First, we need to find the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we first need to calculate the total cost for each offer.

**Furniture United's Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Advance payment} + (\text{Number of installments} \times \text{Amount per installment}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1350 + (6 \times 350) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1350 + 2100 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3450 \]

**Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

Total cost for Cozy Homes:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Advance payment} + (\text{Number of installments} \times \text{Amount per installment}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1100 + (9 \times 250) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1100 + 2250 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3350 \]

Now, we find the cost difference between the two offers:
\[ \text{Cost difference} = \text{Total cost for Furniture United} - \text{Total cost for Cozy Homes} \]
\[ \text{Cost difference} = 3450 - 3350 \]

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ) who will share these 24 guns equally. To find out how many guns each person will have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, each of them would have 6 guns.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Finally, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is \(\boxed{310}\) ounces."
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow the changes in the stock price step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after increase} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

3. **Second Year Decrease:**
   The stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after decrease} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:
\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \). According to the problem, the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is \( 60 \).

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, so we have:

\[ C + H = 60 \]

It is also given that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so:

\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"

   Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Weight of the blue beetle:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird:**
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs:
   \[
   50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. **Total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:**
   The container also weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird, plus the weight of the container:
   \[
   50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the new daily distance Tyson runs.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days in June).
4. Provide the final numerical answer.

First, let's find out how much more Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson should run is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days):

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the week:
\[ \text{Cookies for son's lunch box} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over the week:
\[ \text{Cookies for husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies given to her son and the cookies eaten by her husband from the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies left for Jenny} = 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they made tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they make silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors:

\[ \text{Increase in revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies, and the daisies require 30 plant pots, the roses will require:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both the daisies and the roses:

\[ 30 \text{ (daisies)} + 60 \text{ (roses)} = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over after purchasing the required 90 plant pots, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number she already had:

"Let's denote the amount of money Andrea saved as \( S \).

According to the problem, Andrea initially had $36. After saving some money, she spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother. The remaining money after these expenditures is what she had initially, which is $36.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ S - 11 - 4 = 36 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ S - 15 = 36 \]

To find \( S \), we add 15 to both sides of the equation:

\[ S = 36 + 15 \]
\[ S = 51 \]

So, Andrea saved $51. The final numerical answer is:

Now, let's find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs. She already has $80 in her savings, so her total savings will be:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Given that the shortest tree is 6 feet tall and the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, we can calculate the height of the second tree as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

\[ \$12 \text{ (toy cars)} + \$5 \text{ (teddy bears)} = \$17 \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17 on toys, the amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the activities:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for the go-karts is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- She also wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.

Adding these costs together:
\[
5 \text{ (mini-golf)} + 20 \text{ (go-karts)} + 5 \text{ (arcade tokens)} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After spending $30 on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[
90 - 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the remaining $60 can be used to buy snacks, drinks, or other party supplies, we need to determine how many friends she can invite. However, the question only specifies the activities and does not mention any additional costs or expenses for the friends. Therefore, we assume the remaining $60 is for Morgan herself.

Thus, the number of friends she can invite is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we calculate her total spending over 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Over 5 days, she receives:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she saves in her piggy bank, we subtract her total spending from her total pocket money:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Billy started with $10. If he spent all his money on candy, and the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we need to find out how many pounds of candy he bought. Let's denote the number of pounds of candy he bought as \( x \).

   The total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars. Since he spent all his money, we have:
   \[
   1.5x = 10
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{10}{1.5} = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the change Billy received:**
   After buying the candy, Billy's change is:
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 10 - 1.5 \times \frac{20}{3} = 10 - 10 = 0 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This means Billy did not have any change left after buying the candy.

3. **Determine if the information about gumballs is relevant:**
   The problem states that Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. However, since he had no change, this part of the problem does not affect the number of pounds of candy he bought.

Therefore, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}
\]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third segments. The combined distance of the second and third segments is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third and back to first) is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Thus, the train goes between services every \(\frac{1}{20}\) days, which is equivalent to 12 hours. However, the question asks for the number of days, so the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 to a fraction with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96 and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we sum these scores:
\[
15 + 18 = 33
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more points Jane needs to reach a total of at least 42 points. We set up the equation:
\[
\text{Total points needed} = 42
\]
\[
\text{Points already scored} = 33
\]

To find the additional points required, we subtract the points already scored from the total points needed:
\[
42 - 33 = 9
\]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \) times the number of shoplifters, which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for different reasons is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale:
\[ C + (4C - 5) + 3(4C - 5) = 50. \]

Substituting \( C = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + (4 \times 3 - 5) + 3(4 \times 3 - 5) = 50, \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 3 \times 7 = 50, \]
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is the total number of customers kicked out minus the number kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

Thus, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate how many points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points. Therefore, the number of points Erin had before scoring the 14 points is:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own wallpaper is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

\[

"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   The store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment and then find out how many of them were faulty and how many were functioning.

1. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \).
2. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).
3. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is therefore \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
3. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep. These 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.
4. **Milk from the first half**: 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
5. **Milk from the second half**: 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day:
\[
1 \, \text{kg} + 2 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will have to pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we divide this total repayment by the number of months.

The formula for the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (\(r\)) = 10% = 0.10
- Time (\(t\)) = 5 months

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Now, calculate the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month over 5 months, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1095 \]"
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Cho, the speed is 14 kilometers per hour and the time is 8 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. The speed for Chloe is 9 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together:

"First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for Millie to sell all 36 cups. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the time required to sell all 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The cost to make the lemonade is $18. To find the profit per hour, we need to determine the profit over the 9-hour period and then divide by 9:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

The profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, he sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
L = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[ \text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can determine how many popsicles each person has by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio and then multiplying by the respective parts of the ratio.

First, we find the value of one part of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles Betty has:
\[
\text{Popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

Then, we calculate the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[
\text{Popsicles Sam has} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[
\text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% savings for bundling:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.
- With a 20% savings, the savings amount is \(20 \times 0.20 = 4\) dollars.
- Therefore, the cost after the savings is \(20 - 4 = 16\) dollars a month.

Next, we add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
- The total cost for Hulu, Disney Plus, and Netflix is \(16 + 10 = 26\) dollars a month.

Now, we compare this total cost to the cost of the cable package:
- The cable package costs $60 a month.
- The total cost of the streaming services is $26 a month.
- The savings amount is \(60 - 26 = 34\) dollars a month.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's convert all the time Carol spends on each activity into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording it: half of the time spent writing it = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing it: 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
\[ \text{Total time} = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is \(20\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a special deal: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she only pays $1.50 (which is $3 - $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 \text{ (taffy)} + 1.50 \text{ (seashells)} + 4 \times 0.25 \text{ (magnets)} = 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. The discount amount is:

\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \]

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Therefore, the total amount spent is the cost of the discounted fireworks plus the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Thus, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 5% of the total candles are dangerous. Since the defect (smell like wet dog) is a subset of the dangerous candles, we can use the percentage of dangerous candles to find the number of defective dangerous candles.

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of dangerous candles = 5%

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Since 5% of the dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we calculate the number of defective dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of defective dangerous candles} = 5\% \times 2,500 = 0.05 \times 2,500 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discounted price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount per blouse is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( J_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( J_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( J_{\text{avg}} \). According to the problem, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).

The number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees is half the number she gathers from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( J_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ J_{\text{tall}} + J_{\text{short}} + J_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500. \]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 30 + 15 + J_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 150 + J_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]
Solving for \( J_{\text{avg}} \), we get:
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350. \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \( \boxed{350} \)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
\[
c + d = 180 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
2c + d = 304 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into equation (1) to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is \( 40 \) cubic inches.

\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is calculated as follows:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\). Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal rate of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16)**: The cost is the increased rate of $14 per month.
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$112 = \$184
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{184}

"Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

Substituting the value of \( T \):
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \] dollars.

The total cost of both jeans is:
\[ T + J = 28 + 22 = 50 \] dollars.

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). So, \( S = 6 \).

The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}S = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \] dollars.

The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ S - \frac{1}{3}S = 6 - 2 = 4 \] dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know that the jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \] dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. So, she has a total of 6 bird feeders.
2. Each of the store-bought bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day.
3. Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day.

Now, we calculate the total number of birds expected per day:
- The 3 store-bought bird feeders attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.
- The 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to be seen in her garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner.
\[

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards because he keeps \( \frac{1}{3}x \) cards. He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

According to the problem, after spending $50 on the ticket, he has $50 left. This means the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (since he spent $50 and had $50 left).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 100 cards.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hot dogs the caterer prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hot dogs prepared:
- There were 40 guests, and the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
- Half of 40 guests is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) guests.
- These 20 guests each had 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared for these 20 guests is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) hotdogs.
- The remaining 20 guests (since 40 guests in total minus the 20 who each had 2 hotdogs equals 20) each wanted 1 hotdog, so the total number of hotdogs prepared for these 20 guests is \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \) hotdogs.
- Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) hotdogs.

Next, we need to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog:
- Since 40 guests showed up and each wanted a second hotdog, but only 60 hotdogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 40 - 60 = -20 \). However, since the number of guests cannot be negative, it means that 20 guests did not get a second hotdog because there were not enough hotdogs.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this value:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters. Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6

- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."

\]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
\[
2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left after buying the chips and candy bars. This means that 99% of his $5 was spent on chips and candy bars.

Calculate 99% of $5:
\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars. We know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory and her mom have eaten. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have:

\[ 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

The total weight of the pieces they have eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the pieces they have eaten from the total weight of the cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 15 \text{ ounces} \]

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles this amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can find the width using the area formula:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The final numerical answer is:

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

\[
\boxed{49}

"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times are:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together gives Jon's total time:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 121 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ \text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since the horse runs at 32 MPH, in 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), the horse runs:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:
\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \, \text{\$} = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money he has:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

\[ \text{Joey's new score} = 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

\[ \text{Marcy's new score} = 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is now winning. We do this by subtracting Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:

\[ \text{Points Joey is winning by} = 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers to a department store. The number of remaining sneakers is:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from 31 sneakers} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from the two types of packets separately and then sum them up.

\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two totals together:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This gives us the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original cost per balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the original cost per balloon.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon initially is:
\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.**

The cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Compute the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To find the product:
\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]
\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]
\[
170 \times 65 = 10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

The total time taken for the trip is \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \(50 \text{ mph}\)."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna trades away. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies she receives. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies she receives is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we calculate the total value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she had 8 sapphires, and she traded away 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

The value of these 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Adding the value of the rubies she received to the value of the sapphires she has left, we get the total value of all her jewels:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then sum those amounts.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of green and yellow cards, and then sum all the cards.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - Number of red cards = 15.
   - 60% of 15 = \(0.60 \times 15 = 9\).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24.

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Number of red cards = 15.
   - Number of green cards = 24.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Number of red cards = 15.
   - Number of green cards = 24.
   - Number of yellow cards = 39.
   - Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78.

The final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies with 3 having spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies with 4 having spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to first calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets per room, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases per room.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases per room, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels per room.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry item per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry is:

"First, let's determine the total number of pairs of shoes Fireman Frank gains and loses throughout the week.

- On Monday, he gains 5 pairs.
- On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs.
- On Friday, he gains 30 pairs.
- On Saturday, he loses 180 shoes, which is equivalent to 90 pairs (since each pair has 2 shoes).

Now, let's calculate the total number of pairs he gains and loses:

Total pairs gained = 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 pairs
Total pairs lost = 90 pairs

The net change in the number of pairs of shoes is:
Net change = Total pairs gained - Total pairs lost = 50 - 90 = -40 pairs

Since he started with 200 shoes, we need to convert the net change in pairs to the number of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the net change in shoes is:
Net change in shoes = Net change in pairs * 2 = -40 * 2 = -80 shoes

Therefore, the number of shoes he will have on Sunday is:
Initial shoes - Net change in shoes = 200 - 80 = 120 shoes

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.**

There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
\[
\text{Total pencils at the start} = 30 \times 10 = 300
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many pencils were used after two months.**

After two months, \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the total pencils were used.
\[
\text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.**

Subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils.
\[
\text{Pencils remaining after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240
\]

**Step 4: Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.**

At the end of the year, \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining pencils were left.
\[
\text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80
\]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \). We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

The length of each remora is 6 inches, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot). The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk over the three weeks.
2. Divide the total number of minutes he needs to walk by the total number of days he will walk.

First, we know that three weeks is equal to 21 days (since 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days).

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the new shoes. He plans to walk 4 days a week. Therefore, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Now, we divide the total minutes by the total number of days:
\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth (if necessary), we get:
\[ \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.43 \]

So, Jason needs to spend approximately 11.43 minutes walking each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11.43 \]"
"To determine how many books each child received, we first need to find out the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent a total of $300, we can calculate the number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we need to distribute these books equally among her 4 children. To find out how many books each child received, we divide the total number of books by the number of children:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, each child received 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in total. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

\[
32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

\[

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

\[
\text{Total number of employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

\[
\text{Total number of tour guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of employees} + \text{Total number of tour guides} = 600 + 21 = 621

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the cost per day at the hotel is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the razors after applying the discount and the coupon, and then determine the cost per razor.

First, let's determine the cost of the razors before any discounts or coupons:
- Each pack contains 4 razors.
- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Heather buys 2 packs.

Total cost for 2 packs before any discounts or coupons:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" promotion:
- For every pack bought, one pack is free.
- Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets 2 packs for free.
- Therefore, she only pays for 2 packs.

Since the cost for 2 packs is $8.00, the cost remains $8.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon:
\[ \$8.00 - \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Heather buys 2 packs, which contain:
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.75 \text{ per razor} \]

Finally, we convert the cost per razor to cents:
\[ \$0.75 = 75 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the cost per individual razor after all discounts and the coupon is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid based on that average height.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of cheerleaders in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of each cheerleader is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges brought by Ashley. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for \( n \) guests is $5 per guest, so the total food cost is \( 5n \).
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- The cost of food for \( n \) guests is already included in the price, so the total cost per guest is $25.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  25n
  \]

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Set the two cost expressions equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces and 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24.

The cost of a 2 x 4 piece of wood is $4. With $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4} \]

The cost of a 2 x 8 piece of wood is $6. With $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8} \]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicle sticks he can get from these pieces of wood.

From 6 pieces of 2 x 4:
\[ 6 \text{ pieces} \times 200 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

From 4 pieces of 2 x 8:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces} \times 400 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[ 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1200 \]"

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Given:
- Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
- To lose 1 pound, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
- Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn \( 30 \times 3500 \) calories.

Let's calculate the total calories Andy needs to burn:
\[
30 \times 3500 = 105000 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his goal date (July 19th) from today (December 31st).

- From December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- From January 1st to December 31st is 365 days.
- From January 1st to June 19th (inclusive) is 182 days (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 19 = 182 days).

So, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
\[
365 + 182 = 547 \text{ days}
\]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to maintain, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot \( L \) is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house \( H \):

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:

So, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Ali has. Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. We can calculate the total money as follows:

\[
4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

So, Ali has a total of $160. He gives half of this amount to his sister:

\[
\frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[
160 - 80 = 80
\]

Next, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. We calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints the house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:
\[ \frac{1/2 \text{ house}}{5 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \]

So, one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the house in one day. Therefore, 5 people working together can paint:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day} \]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours required for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

"Let's denote the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \) and the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \) and the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so the total for Ophelia is \( 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so the total for Jenna is \( 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these totals together, we get:
\[ 42 + 130 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times more than those who got off, i.e., \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 63 = 122 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, in 8 years, his cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22 years.
   - His cousin's current age is 57 years.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:

From the problem, we know:
1. \( C = 1100 \)
2. \( P = C - 400 \)
3. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George originally had.
2. According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick originally had \( 2G \) candies.
3. George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   G - 5 = 3
   \]
4. Solving for \( G \):
   \[
   G - 5 = 3 \implies G = 3 + 5 \implies G = 8
   \]
   So, George originally had 8 candies.
5. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had:
   \[
   2G = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]
6. The number of candies Nick has now is the same as the number he originally had, because the problem does not mention any change in the number of candies Nick has.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of money is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \(\frac{18}{3} = 6\) dollars.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share.
   - His new share is \(6 + 5 = 11\) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His total amount after these additions is \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8.
   - His remaining amount is \(21 - 8 = 13\) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - He triples the remaining amount.
   - His new total is \(13 \times 3 = 39\) dollars.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is \(\boxed{39}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable parts. Let's denote the number of days in April as \(30\) days. The second half of the month would then be \(15\) days, and the first half would also be \(15\) days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as \(x\). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of the month would be \(2x\).

The total savings in the first half of the month would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of the month would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \(x\), we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save \(25\) dollars for each day in the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, he has to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Thus, the amount Elvis has to save for each day in the second half of the month is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
\[ 5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
\[ 6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of all the fruits by adding the costs together:
\[ \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the cashier. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total number of miles he walks in a week is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) miles.

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water.

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, we calculate twice the time it takes in cold water and then add 2 minutes:
\[ 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both scenarios.

In cold water, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

In warm water, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer and does not provide \( R \), we cannot compute a specific numerical value without additional information. Thus, the reduction in terms of \( R \) is:

\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume \( R = 4 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then:

\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups. However, without the specific value of \( R \), the answer in terms of \( R \) is:

\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

There are also 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives the total number of rodents:

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is the sum of their weights divided by the number of people (which is 3).

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

Initially, the angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house every hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

This means that the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle (32 degrees) plus the angle the sun has moved upward (50 degrees):

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]

"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since James needs a candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, to find out how much James spends, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Cody} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\text{Sandwiches eaten by Trevor} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
\text{Total sandwiches eaten} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many sandwiches are left:

\[
\text{Sandwiches left} = 12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age.

First, we express Shiloh's age in 7 years:
\[ S + 7 = 44 + 7 = 51 \]

Let's denote his nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N + 7 \):
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( N \):
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Thus, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

We know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Mitchell made from selling lemonade.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate how much money he spends each day and then determine how many action figures he buys over the week.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Peter has:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), the daily spending is:
\[ \frac{70 \text{ dollars}}{7 \text{ days}} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, we determine how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. This is 4 days:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $20 on wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money is:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/day} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money after buying plastic action figures is:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $44:
\[ \frac{44 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 22 \text{ figures} \]

Adding the wooden action figures and the plastic action figures, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ 20 \text{ wooden figures} + 22 \text{ plastic figures} = 42 \text{ figures} \]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up all the individual costs:

\[ 200 + 60 + 48 = 308 \]

So, the total cost for Leah is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week and then compare it to the number of roses Ford grows per week.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Next, we know that Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses Ford lacks per week, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we multiply the weekly shortage by 4:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ roses per month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of months in 2 years.
2. Determine the total amount of money removed from the account over these months.
3. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread.
- The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

Thus, the net profit is:
\[ \boxed{37} \]"

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

If Kate can sell each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate her total earnings by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Kate can make is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for new carpet and padding} = 2592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 11232 \]"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

The next step is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Adding half of the starting value to the starting value} = S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we divide this result by 5:
\[ \text{Dividing by 5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Then, we need to multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
\[ \text{Starting value minus 12} = S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8 \]
\[ \text{Multiplying by the result from the previous step} = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature. Now, we need to find the temperature setting \( T \) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees. Since the oven is off by 4%, the set temperature \( T \) should be such that:
\[ 450 \times (1 + 0.04) = 450 \times 1.04 = 468 \]

We need to find \( T \) such that:
\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of the two movies together.

First movie duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Second movie duration: 2 hours and 5 minutes

Convert the first movie duration to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Now, add the second movie duration:
2 hours and 5 minutes = (2 × 60) + 5 = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, add the durations of both movies:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and then subtract that from Herb's price.

Herb's house price is $76,000. So, 30% of $76,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Subtracting this amount from Herb's house price gives us the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes brought:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68 \text{ dishes} \]

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 120 \text{ utensils} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount means Pete pays 90% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of one box} = 100.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 100.00 \times 0.90 = 90.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 2 boxes at the discounted price.

\[ \text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, he will have 180 contacts, which means he will have enough contacts to last him:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{45 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ days per pair of contacts} \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \text{Cost per pair of contacts} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (from aerobics) + 600 calories (from running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 800 \text{ ml} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]

The number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

The three measurements are 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we sum these three values and then divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]
First, we calculate the sum:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]
Then, we divide the sum by 3:
\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]
So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference in weight is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

1. The base cost for 2 implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) dollars.
2. One of the implants has an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is \(500\) dollars.
3. Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = 4500\) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much more money George needs to pay after his deposit. He has already put down a deposit of \(600\) dollars, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = 3900\) dollars.

George earns \(15\) dollars per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \(3900\) dollars, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{3900}{15} = 260
\]

So, George needs to work for \(260\) hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, the final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the legs from all the pets:
\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the new weight after Jamaal increases the weight by 50%.

The original weight is 8 pounds. A 50% increase means we calculate 50% of 8 pounds and add it to the original weight.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the new weight after the increase is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, Jamaal uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than the increased weight. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from the increased weight:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight that Jamaal now uses is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break down his purchases and gifts year by year.

**Year 1:**
- Initial games: 5
- Games bought: 1 game per month for 12 months = 12 games
- Total games at the end of Year 1: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games

**Year 2:**
- Initial games: 17 (from Year 1)
- Games bought: 2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 17 (from Year 1) + 24 (bought) = 41 games
- Games received for Christmas: 5 games
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 41 + 5 = 46 games

**Year 3:**
- Initial games: 46 (from Year 2)
- Games bought: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games
- Total games at the end of Year 3: 46 (from Year 2) + 48 (bought) = 94 games
- Games received for Christmas: 5 games
- Total games at the end of Year 3: 94 + 5 = 99 games

Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 99.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed \( v \) is:
\[ v = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the additional hours required to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total amount of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract this from his initial amount of $100.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[
8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[
100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

\[
\text{Cups sold in 4 hours} = 15 \, \text{cups/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 60 \, \text{cups}
\]

\[
\text{Earnings from the first 4 hours} = 60 \, \text{cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30
\]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

\[
\text{Cups sold in 2 hours} = 10 \, \text{cups/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{cups}
\]

\[
\text{Earnings from the next 2 hours} = 20 \, \text{cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12
\]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time to find the total earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$30 + \$12 = \$42
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rotations the tires of Jeremy's car undergo in a month and then calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.

First, we calculate the number of rotations the tires make in one mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rotations the tires make in 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations in 400 miles} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145000 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we first find out how many months it will take to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Months to reach 10,440,000 rotations} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:
\[ \text{Years to reach 10,440,000 rotations} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ years} \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes that can be achieved with one pump.
2. Calculate the total number of washes that can be achieved with the jumbo bottle.
3. Calculate the cost per pump in dollars.
4. Convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, each pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and can give 120 washes. So, the cost per wash is:
\[ \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per wash is the same as the cost per pump. Therefore, the cost per pump in dollars is $0.20. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is also a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ 94860 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it costs \(\boxed{65760}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   
   The first 5 months of the extended period are already accounted for in the initial funding. So, the remaining months are \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   
   Each of these 45 months requires 50% more funding than the initial $20,000 per month (since the initial funding per month was $100,000 / 5 = $20,000).

   The increased funding per month is:
   \[
   20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000
   \]

   Therefore, the total funding for the 45 months is:
   \[
   45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000
   \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   Adding the initial funding and the extended funding:
   \[
   100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these values.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the beef tips is:
   \[
   8 \text{ tips} \times 1 \text{ ounce per tip} = 8 \text{ ounces}
   \]
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate:
   \[
   16 \text{ ounces}
   \]
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed based on the given fraction.

First, calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate the number of bloomed flowers:
\[ \text{Number of bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert the speed to Mb per second as follows:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Company's acquisition cost} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we determine the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Company's acquisition cost} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = 2000 \)
- The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, so \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \).
- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so \( S = G - 400 \).

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \).

\[
\boxed{4800}

"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp he purchased and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is closing the gap at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is reducing the 75-mile gap by 15 miles every hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the entire 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. According to the problem, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( C \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[
C = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

According to the parents' condition, they will not sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10. We need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's assume Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost remains $60, but the number of classes decreases to \( 10 - x \). The new cost per class is:
\[
C' = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need \( C' \) to be greater than $10:
\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} > 10
\]

To solve this inequality, we first multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x > 0 \) for the inequality to hold):
\[
60 > 10(10 - x)
\]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right-hand side:
\[
60 > 100 - 10x
\]

Subtract 100 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
60 - 100 > -10x
\]
\[
-40 > -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality sign):
\[
4 < x
\]

This inequality tells us that \( x \) must be greater than 4. Since \( x \) represents the number of classes missed, and it must be a whole number, the smallest integer greater than 4 is 5.

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10, and he can miss 5 classes and still be within the parents' condition.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to first find out how many customers each of them processes in a day and then calculate their weekly totals.

1. **Determine the number of customers Jewel processes in a day:**
   \[
   \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 50
   \]

2. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes in a day:**
   Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice as many customers in a day.
   \[
   \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week:**
   There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350

4. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by Julie in a week:**
   Similarly, there are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Jewel's weekly customers} + \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 350 + 700 = 1050
   \]

The total weekly production for the two is:

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the cost of the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, we sum all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500

"To calculate Tim's annual salary after his promotion, we need to consider both his raise and his bonus.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of his monthly salary.
- The raise amount is \( 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- The bonus amount is \( 20000 \times 0.5 = 10000 \).

Now, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary:
- New monthly salary = Original monthly salary + Raise + Bonus
- New monthly salary = \( 20000 + 1000 + 10000 = 31000 \).

Finally, let's calculate his annual salary:
- Annual salary = New monthly salary \(\times\) 12 months

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to find the total time taken to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the 20 pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the 20 pomegranates on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:

"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800. 

Next, we need to find the total amount she made in the first month. This is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the totals from both months:

\[ \text{Total two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   James gets 1 hour of free carriage time. Therefore, he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - The second hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
   - The third hour is twice the cost of the second hour, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

4. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - Cost of the first hour: $15
   - Cost of the second hour: $30
   - Cost of the third hour: $60

   Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{105}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since each deviled egg consists of 2 halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper. Therefore, the number of pages she has written is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, the number of pages Shiela has left to write is \( 10 \)."
"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book if he reads 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is given by the total number of pages divided by the number of pages he reads per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the total number of days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}
\]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane and the annual expenses:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}
\]"
"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ R + P = 30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. Therefore, we can write the following equations:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the second equation to find \( g \):
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now we can check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, for a week (7 days), he will use 7 pounds of coffee. The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:

\[ 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find out the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

Gus bought:
- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[4 + 8 + 1 = 13\] dollars

Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total amount spent on the other items from the total amount spent:
\[20 - 13 = 7\] dollars

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[7\]"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600. The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209. So, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = \text{Total newspapers} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C}) \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

So, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
150 - 90 = 60
\]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[
60 \times 6 = 360
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\boxed{360}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they share equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120. Therefore, Kassidy has:
\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna has:
\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to add together their money and share it equally, each person would get:
\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these up:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining 6 days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The next three days are: Good, Neutral, Good

Adding these to the existing counts:
- Good days: \(12 + 2 = 14\)
- Bad days: \(8\) (unchanged)
- Neutral days: \(10 + 1 = 11\) (since one neutral day is already counted)

The total number of days is still 30, and the counts are consistent.

Finally, we need to find the number of good days left in the month:
\[
\text{Total good days} = 14
\]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ J = 21 \]

Substituting the value of \( J \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The total growth needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches is:

"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 8 + 8 = 16 dogs in total. Since he already has 4 toys, he needs 16 - 4 = 12 more toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. This means he had 16 - 3 = 13 dogs, and he already had 4 toys, so he needed 13 - 4 = 9 more toys.

Adding up all the toys he needs, we get:
- 4 toys for the initial 8 dogs
- 12 toys for the 16 dogs after buying more
- 9 toys for the 13 dogs after 3 dogs left

So, the total number of toys James needs is 4 + 12 + 9 = 25.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine by how much the elevator will exceed its maximum load, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

1. Jack's weight: 80 kg
2. Each of the 8 other adults weighs 80 kg, so the total weight of the 8 adults is \(8 \times 80 = 640\) kg.

Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg} + 640 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by \(\boxed{20}\) kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

First, we solve for \( M \):
\[
M - 5 = 68 \implies M = 68 + 5 \implies M = 73
\]

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Next, we find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has:
\[
M = C + 12 \implies 73 = C + 12 \implies C = 73 - 12 \implies C = 61
\]

Now we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. We can find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[
M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96
\]

So, Summer has 96 cookies. Now we sum up the number of cookies each person has:
\[
\text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time for each half separately and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = \(\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = \(\frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we sum the times for both halves:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44, so we can write another equation:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins (\( T \)):

\[ T = Tr + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 13 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time John spends on his homework from the total time he has before dinner:

\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Let's denote the cost of one candy as \( c \).

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ c = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over a period of ten years, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's find out how many coins Rong saves per month:
\[ \text{Rong's monthly savings} = 20 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we calculate Neil's monthly savings. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left(20 \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of months in ten years:
\[ \text{Total months in ten years} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years:
\[ \text{Total coins saved by Rong} = 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
\[ \text{Total coins saved by Neil} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we sum the total coins saved by Rong and Neil:
\[ \text{Total coins saved by both} = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each colored square and then sum these to get the total number of squares. Finally, since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area will be equal to the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red Squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green Squares} = \text{Blue Squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White Squares} = \text{Green Squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of square to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
\text{Total Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + \text{Blue Squares} + \text{Green Squares} + \text{White Squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount of money raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount of money needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

"To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total area of the bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for the calculated area.

First, calculate the area that needs to be covered:
\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, the total number of tiles required for 24 square feet is:
\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
576

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

The fixed fee is $20, and the variable fee is $1.5 per pound. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries. Therefore, the variable cost is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the fixed fee to the variable cost gives the total cost James incurred:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

Thus, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original total cost would be:

\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

Next, we need to find the new price of each computer, which is 10% higher than the original price. The original price per computer is $700. A 10% increase in the price is calculated as:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she taps her feet.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.

For 5 minutes with her arms at her sides:
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.

For 3 minutes with her arms raised:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1200 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:

   Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 4 pizzas (one for Bryce and three for his friends).

   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices Bryce and two friends ate:**
   Bryce and two friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas.

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends} = 3 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Determine how many slices the two remaining friends ate:**
   The two remaining friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas.

   \[

   \]

5. **Calculate the number of slices left:**
   Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices.

   \[
   \text{Slices left} = 48 - 42 = 6 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat 9 sausages is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this as:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
\]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
\]
Substituting the father's age:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Given that candidate A got 20% of the votes, and there were 100 voters, we can calculate the votes for candidate A as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate the additional votes for candidate B as follows:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

Adding these additional votes to candidate A's votes gives us the total votes for candidate B:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. Therefore, the votes for candidate C can be calculated by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each person has is updated as follows:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck now has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

First, let's denote the number of books Steven has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Clara has two times as many books as Steven. We are given that Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
2S = 20
\]

Solving for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, the number of books Alice has is:
\[
A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We already know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:
\[
20 - 16 = 4
\]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

According to the problem, 10 students like to bake, 5 students like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or play music. The total number of students is 50. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is \( 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \).

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, \( M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

Since the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, and we know that 10 of them like to play music, the number of students who like to play video games is \( V = 35 - 10 = 25 \).

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, since 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[5 \times 3 = 15\]

After tripling, Mara ate 2 slices:

\[15 - 2 = 13\]

Then, her friend stole 5 slices:

\[13 - 5 = 8\]

So, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is:

\[\boxed{8}\]"
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
\[ 8 \text{ (dogs)} + 5 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (birds)} + 12 \text{ (horses)} = 28 \text{ animals} \]

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ animals}}{7 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ animals per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards, each costing $1800.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Adding these values together gives the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

\[ \text{Savings} = 76 - 48 = 28 \]

The family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the daily savings and then extend that to a weekly savings.

First, let's calculate the daily savings:
- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily savings per tomato:
\[ 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

Total daily savings for 500 tomatoes:
\[ 500 \times 0.1 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 350 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Thus, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has and the number Sean has.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Sean has:**
   Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental pattern and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
- There are 2 weekend days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends separately:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 20 weekdays, the number of chairs rented is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. Therefore, in 8 weekend days, the number of chairs rented is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is:
\[1200 + 800 = 2000\]

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \times 2 = 4000\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know the monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, each roommate's monthly cost is:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of glasses and plates Jeff sent.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the number of glasses sent is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. The number of plates sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

Next, we account for the broken items. 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the number of glasses and plates that are not broken are:
\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses} \]
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates} \]

Adding the non-broken glasses and plates together, we get the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:
\[ 86 + 42 = 128 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \).
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \).

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \).
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27.
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20.
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60.
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \).

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{107}\)."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"First, let's determine the number of people who think horse #2 will win. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This means the remaining number of people is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. Since 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This leaves the rest of the people to think that horse #12 will win. The number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

It is also given that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books Ahmed read and then calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in the same hour. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as \( A \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 300 = 2A \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will have read after reading an additional 150 books. Since Ezra already read 300 books, after reading 150 more books, the total number of books Ezra will have read is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He has 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \] wheels.

So, the number of wheels left is \(\boxed{276}\)."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we first find 20% of the original price and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the laptop is $1000.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtracting this discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, the final price you have to pay after the discount is $800."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cost step by step.

1. **Total number of movies:** 600

2. **Movies in series:** A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of movies in series} = \frac{600}{3} = 200
   \]
   Since these movies can be bought at a discounted price of $6, the cost for these movies is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

3. **Remaining movies after removing the series movies:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

4. **Number of older movies:** 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is $5 each:
   \[
   \text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

5. **Remaining movies after removing the older movies:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
   \]

6. **Cost for the remaining movies:** The remaining movies are normal movies, each costing $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost for remaining movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
   \]

7. **Total cost to replace the movies:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for series movies} + \text{Cost for older movies} + \text{Cost for remaining movies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4400}

"To calculate the total amount Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total cost:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance driven is given by:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of this speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
The distance hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances driven and hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 30 points less than Emma for the timer. Let's denote the points Emma gets for the timer as \( T_E \). Then, Ava gets \( T_E - 30 \) points for the timer.

The score for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Ava's score: \( 10E_A + 5B_A + (T_E - 30) \)
- Emma's score: \( 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \)

Substituting \( E_A \) and \( B_A \) in terms of \( E_E \) and \( B_E \):
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

So, Ava's score becomes:
\[ 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + (T_E - 30) = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + T_E - 30 = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65 \]

Emma's score remains:
\[ 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65) - (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E) = 65 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{65} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. Then, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas. Finally, we divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

1. Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
   \[
   30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
   \[
   64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Divide the combined cost of the other two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each of these pizzas:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
2

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
- They ride for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, he makes a round trip each day. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance he travels in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons consumed per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she has 10 twenties, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much more money John needs after accounting for the school's contribution.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school's contribution is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

John currently has $50. After the school's contribution, the remaining amount John needs is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

However, since John already has $50, the additional amount he needs is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the temperature during the night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the temperature during the night is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing 90 by 9:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups. Next, we need to determine how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. Therefore, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

This means 6 groups brought back seashells. Since each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie earned from her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours on that day. Out of these, 8 hours are regular hours and the remaining 3 hours are additional hours.

The earnings from the regular hours are:

"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are on sale for 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10.00. To find the sale price of the jeans, we subtract the discount from the original price:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30.00. Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from $50.00:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

Adding these to the initial 200 employees, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary**: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Initial wage ($10 per hour)**:
   \[
   10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **After 2 months ($10.50 per hour)**:
   \[
   10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **On his first anniversary ($11.50 per hour)**:
   \[
   11.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}

   230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we find the difference in earnings between the highest wage stage and the initial wage stage:
\[
230 \text{ dollars} - 200 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:
Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial wage:
\[
10 \text{ dollars/hour} + 0.50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 10.50 \text{ dollars/hour}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1240 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she has played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she has played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation distance} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: \( 340 \)
- Fourth graders: \( 40 \)
- Fifth graders: \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \)

Now, we sum the number of students who passed:

\[ 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \]

The total number of students tested is:

\[ 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \]

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested:

\[ \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 0.70 \) or 70%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's determine how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Initially, Dale had 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies.
3. After selling 150 candies, he had 100 - 150 = -50 candies. Since he can't have negative candies, this means he ran out of candies and needed to order more.
4. He then ordered 100 more candies, bringing his total back to 100 + 100 = 200 candies.
5. Now, he needs to sell all 200 candies to meet his goal.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10

2. **Number of students at the end of each month**:
   - **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
   - **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
   - **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
   - **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
   - **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

3. **Total number of students by the end of May**:
   - Total students = 320

4. **Number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year**:
   - 10

5. **Additional students who joined by the end of May**:
   - \(320 - 10 = 310\)

Thus, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310.

\[

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower from each of the 4 groups, so she drops:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ flowers} \]

Each of these dropped flowers has a certain number of petals:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the final number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{14}{2} \right\rfloor = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jack and his friends use to play the game for 4 hours.

First, let's convert the total play time from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the play time for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Each of the two worse friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
\[ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes each, so together they play for:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows them to play for 20 minutes, we need to determine how many quarters are required to play for 70 minutes:
\[ \frac{70}{20} = 3.5 \text{ quarters} \]

Since they can only use whole quarters, they will need to use 4 quarters to ensure they can play for at least 70 minutes.

Thus, the total amount of money used is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, substituting \( S \) for \( C \) and \( F \) in the equation for oil, we get:
\[ O = 2S \]

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]
Substituting \( O = 2S \), \( F = S \), \( C = S \), and \( G = S \) into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil \( O \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then add these two amounts together.

The cost of the goats is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = 3 \times 500 = \$1500 \]

The cost of the cows is calculated as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = 2 \times 1500 = \$3000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500 \]

So, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[ \boxed{4500} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \( 40 - 8 = 32 \) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) cars left.

Thus, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she spent walking each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. 

Next, we are told that on the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she spent walking on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to find the total time she spent walking over the two days. We add the hours from both days:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

Since the question asks for the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate how many cars left the parking lot during the lunch break.
3. Find out how many cars remained in the parking lot after the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

"First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contains 11 tins, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contains 6 tins, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we'll find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The cost for the weight is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refund amount from Amazon:**
   - The purchase price of the book is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
   - The net loss is \(3.00 - 24.00 = -21.00\) dollars.
   - Since the net loss is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21.00.

Therefore, Milly will gain $21.00. The final numerical answer is:

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and calculate the time spent on each.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs each week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For a month with 4 weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup each week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For a month with 4 weeks, the total time spent on makeup is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**
   - Adding up all the time spent on TikTok-related activities:
     \[
     288 \text{ minutes (videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is \(\boxed{1128}\) minutes."
"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost Calculation:**
   - The base cost for the installation is $129.00.
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base cost already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

2. **Additional Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.
   - Total additional cost = 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) * $15.00 = 2 * $15.00 + 1 * $15.00 + 10 * $15.00 = $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Total cost = Base cost + Additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

Thus, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[
20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more money than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]
Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:
\[
30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{42.00}

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ 80 \, \text{miles} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speeds, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

First, let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \) and the distance across the highway as \( d \).

Given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can write the equation for the distance \( d \) as:
\[ d = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ d = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance \( d \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

The time \( t \) it takes for 4 turtles to cross the highway is given by:
\[ t = \frac{d}{4 \times \frac{v}{2}} \]
\[ t = \frac{54v}{4 \times \frac{v}{2}} \]
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} \]
\[ t = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours it will take for four turtles to cross the highway is 27 hours.

\[
\boxed{27}

"To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by determining the number of dishes each person made based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, the number of dishes Rory made is:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, the number of dishes Jada made is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has:
\[ 150 \text{ (from her part-time job)} + 80 \text{ (from her mom)} + \text{money in her purse} = \text{total money} \]

Let's denote the money in Erika's purse as \( x \). According to the problem, she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total money she has is $400 minus the $50 she still needs:
\[ 150 + 80 + x = 400 - 50 \]
\[ 230 + x = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the large and small apples.

From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

According to the problem, Jack has 60 dishes, so:
\[ D = 60 \]

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2S \) socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{D}{2} \) dishes. Since \( D = 60 \), Peter has:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ dishes} \]

Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so:
\[ D = 2S \]
Since \( D = 60 \), we can solve for \( S \):
\[ 60 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]
So, Jack has 30 socks.

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes.
- Peter has 30 socks and 30 dishes.

The total number of socks is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
\[ M = 5 \text{ (good at math only)} + B \]
\[ E = 8 \text{ (good at English only)} + B \]
\[ M + E - B = 20 \text{ (total students)} \]

Substituting the expressions for \( M \) and \( E \) in terms of \( B \) into the total students equation:
\[ (5 + B) + (8 + B) - B = 20 \]
\[ 5 + 8 + B = 20 \]
\[ 13 + B = 20 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is 7. Now, we can find the total number of students good at math:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, and then fit this into the total available time for the concert.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for the concert, including the intermission, is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes available for performances:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Thus, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The original investment (principal, \( P \)) is $300. The annual interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is:
\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( t \) is the time in years.

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

First, calculate the interest:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025. Adding this to the original investment gives the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total number of goats left.

First, we know that Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. The number of goats sold from Farm Y is twice the number sold from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

Next, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:
- Farm X initially had 55 goats and sold 10 goats, so the remaining goats in Farm X are \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- Farm Y initially had 45 goats and sold 20 goats, so the remaining goats in Farm Y are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we need to clean one-half of them, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we sum the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), substituting \( B = Y + 3 \), we get \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To verify, we can calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, and he will have 2 extra glue sticks, 7 packs is the correct number to buy.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day**: The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water after the first day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: The amount of water doubles again. Therefore, the amount of water after the second day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 16000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: The volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water after the third day is:
   \[
   16000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 22000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the third day is:
\[
\boxed{22000}
\]"
"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people from the previous day.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]
So, after Day 1, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 10 + 60 = 70 \]

**Day 2:**
Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 70 \times 6 = 420 \]
So, after Day 2, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 70 + 420 = 490 \]

**Day 3:**
Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
\[ 490 \times 6 = 2940 \]
So, after Day 3, the total number of infected people is:
\[ 490 + 2940 = 3430 \]

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is:
\[ \boxed{3430} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, the total amount Rafaela received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. Therefore, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we add the amounts of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received altogether:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\). 

Subtracting the oranges given away from the initial amount, Jennifer remained with \(12 - 9 = 3\) oranges.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges each person earns per month:
- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so Amber earns \(\frac{1}{2}\) badge per month.
- Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 badges per month.

Next, we calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year (12 months):
- Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges in a year.
- Amber earns \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) badges in a year.
- Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges in a year.

Now, we find the difference in the number of badges Wendy earns compared to Amber:
\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

Given that \( G = 70 \), we can substitute this value into the equation to find \( S \):

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed.
3. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos is:

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

1. **Red Cars**: Given as 12.
2. **Green Cars**: 2 fewer than red cars.
   \[
   \text{Green Cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: 3 times the number of green cars.
   \[
   \text{Blue Cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
\text{Total of Red, Green, and Blue Cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
\text{Yellow Cars} = 75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, Fawn has:

\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books that Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds and the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of small jello cups Greg wants to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of flavored jello are required to make 120 jello cups. Since one box makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 500 \]"
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost that Madeline pays.
2. Calculate the total monthly cost that Keenan pays.
3. Determine the weekly cost that Keenan pays.

First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate the amount Madeline pays as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly cost} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, the amount Keenan pays is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly cost} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \(\frac{7}{13}\) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far is the sum of the pieces he ate on the first, second, and third days:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (3 \times 3.00) + (2 \times 2.00) = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
\]
So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000
\]
The total revenue from selling the chickens is $9000.

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]
Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use the $40 profit to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total profit by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since the rope is sold in whole meters, Sarah can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost for 26 meters} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total profit to find out how much money Sarah will have left over.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones were successfully paired and then calculate the number of pairs.

First, we calculate the number of microphones that won't be paired. Since 20% of the microphones won't find space, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of flowering plants:**
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden is \(25\%\)."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

"Let's break down the costs Ellen incurs each day:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for these items is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of times she mowed lawns is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that she earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and assuming she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, her earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as \( 6x \).

Since her total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade were $80, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 6x + \text{lemonade earnings} = 80 \]

To find the lemonade earnings, we need to determine \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the exact number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, so we can't solve for \( x \) directly. But we can express the lemonade earnings in terms of \( x \):

\[ \text{lemonade earnings} = 80 - 6x \]

Since the problem does not provide additional information to solve for \( x \), we can't determine the exact number of lemonade earnings without it. However, if we assume the problem is solvable with the given information, we can infer that the lemonade earnings are the remaining amount after accounting for the mowing earnings.

Given the problem's context and the information provided, we can conclude that the lemonade earnings are:

\[ \text{lemonade earnings} = 80 - 6x \]

Since the problem does not provide \( x \), we can't determine a specific numerical value for the lemonade earnings. However, if we assume the problem is designed to have a specific numerical answer, we can infer that the lemonade earnings are:

\[ \text{lemonade earnings} = 80 - 6 \times 1 = 74 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of Carl. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 74 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ rentals/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/rental} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so his profit is:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \). According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]
Solving for \( M \), we get:
\[ M = 7 - 5 = 2 \]
So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Consequently, Joseph had \( 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \) notebooks.

After buying 5 more notebooks, Martha now has 7 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Thus, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we start by determining the distance Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's summarize the information given:

- Yesterday:
  - Denise read 10 pages.
  - Daniel read 13 pages.

- Today:
  - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
  - Daniel read 0 pages today.

Now, let's calculate the number of pages Denise read today:
- Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

Next, we calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:
- Denise's total pages: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel's total pages: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:
- The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of bowls that can be filled from the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can also fill 8 child's bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child's bowls).

4. **Calculate the leftover soup in terms of child's bowls:**
   - Total bowls needed: 4
   - Bowls that can be filled from the pot: 8
   - Leftover bowls: \( 8 - 4 = 4 \) child's bowls.

5. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - There are 2 children, and there are 4 leftover bowls.
   - Each child can have \( \frac{4 \text{ bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bowls} \).

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The final numerical answer is:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we sum up the time he spends on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

Let's denote:
- Duncan's current age as \( D \)
- Adam's current age as \( A \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \)
2. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \)
3. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \)
4. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, which can be written as:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine spent and then divide that amount by 2, since they combined their allowances.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is \(12 \times 0.25 = 3\) dollars.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[11 + 3 + 14 = 28\]
So, Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28.

Since they combined their allowances, the total amount of money their mother gave them is $28. Since they each received the same amount, we divide $28 by 2:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets Larry has:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, each row has \( 2x \) cups of tea.

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. The total number of cups of tea is 27, so the number of cups used for cinnamon tea is:
\[ 27 - 6x = 15 \]

We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it in the equation:
\[ 27 - 6x = 15 \]
\[ 27 - 15 = 6x \]
\[ 12 = 6x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, in each row, there are \( x = 2 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( x = 2 \) cups of mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into the tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

The time for one complete trip is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of trips he can make is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many berries he picks up per trip. Since he needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he makes 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the remaining budget after these purchases:
- Colby starts with $150.
- After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, the remaining budget is \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since it is a Friday, the ticket price is $10. We need to find out how many tickets he can buy with $126, considering he has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days.

The total number of movies he has already seen is \(5 + 8 = 13\) movies. Since he can only see one movie per ticket, he has already used up 13 tickets. Therefore, he can buy \(126 / 10 = 12.6\) tickets, but since he can only buy whole tickets, he can buy 12 more tickets.

Thus, the number of additional movies he can see is 12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for the mini versions as follows:

- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:

- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories/mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \).
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories/mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \).

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:

\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \( 85000 \).

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"

The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So, the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean by \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Q + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Q = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Q + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"First, we calculate the total distance each person spits the seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance both spitted:
- Total distance = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance = Total distance / 2
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling these widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800
\]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money after this expense is:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract this amount from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to buy 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, we sum these components to find the total charge:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205

"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The remaining distance is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"First, let's determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery had based on the information given.

We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of loaves in the bakery} = 7 \times (\text{Number of loaves Sam had}) - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[ \text{Number of loaves in the bakery} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Then, subtract 40:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To find Leo's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, we substitute Deanna's age into the second equation to find Marcus's age:
\[ M = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now we know Marcus is 21 years old. Using the first equation, we can find Leo's age:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each page is printed on both sides of the paper, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ 150 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 150 \]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in the total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this into minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier.

First, let's calculate the usual sleep duration:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- The total usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
- Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

Next, let's determine the actual sleep duration:
- Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
- She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the actual sleep time:
- From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
- Converting 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 420 + 55 = 475\) minutes.
- Subtract the time she spent sleepwalking: \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 452 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has initially is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. The total number of utensils is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Thus, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in 2 holes:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 27 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"

"First, we need to determine the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation:

\[
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
\]

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\[
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's convert the quantities of brownies into individual pieces. Each brownie is considered as one piece.

- Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen = 12 brownies.
- Sent home with 1/2 dozen from her office: 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies.
- Friends at her home threw her a surprise party: 4 dozen = 48 brownies.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen were eaten: 1 1/2 dozen = 9 brownies.

Now, let's sum up all the brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party:
\[ 66 - 9 = 57 \text{ brownies} \]

"First, let's determine the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's age is 8 years.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we can find the total age of all three family members by adding their ages together:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, the total length of the fence is the perimeter of the rectangle.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes this represents, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes of oranges. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:

"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E \), his dad's current age as \( D \), and his brother's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E = 19 \)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.

First, let's determine the number of years from now when Emil will be 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil's age will be 24, his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \), and his brother's age will be \( B + 5 \).

According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

Next, according to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be twice the age of his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]

- Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, we sum up all the beads Adrianne received:

\[
20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90
\]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. These 6 students will need to leave early to travel to the away game. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size 5 and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots}}{2} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the plant width. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ new plants} \]

Each new plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many, we calculate:
\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel intake} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Thus, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, we need to determine the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used by the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used by the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations combined:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil available for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's determine how long it will take her to saute 30 shrimp. According to the information given, she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Since we need to saute 90 shrimp, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[
\text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp. Since the tasks can be done sequentially (one after the other), we add the time required for each task:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} + \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it will cool the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, it will cool the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room will warm up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, it will warm up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, we sum up the changes in temperature:
- Cooling due to low setting: \(-6\) degrees.
- Cooling due to high setting: \(-12\) degrees.
- Warming due to no air conditioner: \(+4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is:
\[
-6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age difference between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the second sighting must have occurred 75 years after the first sighting. Therefore, the age difference between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill Check**: He writes a check for the gas bill once per month, which also amounts to 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church Check**: He writes a check to the church twice per month, which means he writes 24 church checks per year (2 checks/month * 12 months/year).
4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: He writes a check quarterly (every 3 months) to the pest and lawn service. This means he writes 4 checks per year (1 check every 3 months * 12 months/year).

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \]

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \). The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88. \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France by substituting \( F = 88 \) into the expression for the number of flights to France:
\[ \text{Number of flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias's howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Sum the durations of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his mother and father from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the average age of the group:**
   The total age of the children is 20. Since there are 4 children, the average age is:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

2. **Express Helene's age in terms of the average age:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:
   \[
   \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Set up an equation for the total age of the children:**
   The total age of the children is the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, and we have Helene's age. Let Wilfred's age be \( W \). The equation for the total age is:
   \[
   3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
   \]

4. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   17 + W = 20
   \]
   Subtract 17 from both sides:
   \[
   W = 20 - 17 = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice in relation to the others.

Let's denote the total number of slices of the watermelon as \( S \). If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can assume that the slices are divided in a ratio of 2:1 for the adults to the kids. This means that for every 3 slices (2 for adults and 1 for a kid), the watermelon is divided.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices can be represented as \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) slices. According to the ratio, each adult gets 2 slices and each kid gets 1 slice. Therefore, the total number of slices \( S \) is 6.

Each adult gets 2 slices out of the total 6 slices. The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of slices for each adult}}{\text{Total number of slices}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{6} \right) \times 100 = \frac{200}{6} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33\%
\]

So, each adult gets approximately \( 33.33\% \) of the watermelon.

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on inpatients is:
\[ 9 \times 20 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends on appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on inpatients and appointments gives:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the entire cake-making process.

If the cake needs to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Thus, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ \boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}} \]"

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total population will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool by multiplying the volume in gallons by the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( V_{\text{gallons}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ V_{\text{gallons}} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost per gallon is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ C = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of sticks is:
\[

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:
\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. So, the charge after 5 hours is:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous state. So, the charge after an additional 3 hours is:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This indicates that the initial charge \( C \) must be scaled appropriately to satisfy the equation. Since the equation holds true with the given values, the initial charge \( C \) is:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.523 \) or 52.3%. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.3\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount, so we calculate 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches is \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars.
- The cost of 4 pears is \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 kiwis is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 apples is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars.

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the amount of money he has left to spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars.

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy with $0.75 is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[
15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs}
\]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

\[
\frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend}
\]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[
1.3 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{78}

"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value of the price.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \approx 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. We know that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums, with 3 albums being selfies only and 2 albums being portraits only. This means the remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums) must contain a mix of selfies and portraits.

Let's denote the number of selfies in the 3 mixed albums as \( S_m \) and the number of portraits in the 3 mixed albums as \( P_m \). The total number of selfies and portraits in these 3 mixed albums is \( S_m + P_m \).

Since the total number of selfies and portraits in all 8 albums is 72, we can write the equation:
\[ 3 + 2 + S_m + P_m = 72 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 5 + S_m + P_m = 72 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:
\[ S_m + P_m = 67 \]

Since the 3 mixed albums contain a mix of selfies and portraits, and we don't have additional information to distinguish between the selfies and portraits in these albums, we can assume that the distribution in these albums is such that the total number of selfies and portraits is 67. Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Guests who checked out late:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests now}
   \]

5. **Additional guests who checked in after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests now}
   \]

Thus, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picks each day and then sum them up.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of easy questions:**
   - There are 60 questions in total.
   - 40% of the questions are easy.
   \[
   \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of average and difficult questions:**
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions.
   \[
   \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
   \[
   \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
   \[
   \text{Easy questions Aries gets correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is given as $4. Since large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, the total earnings can be expressed as:

\[ 12L + 4S = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 12L + 4(2L) = 120 \]
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:

\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Calculate the total ore mining for 30 days.

First, let's find the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe. According to the problem, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds per day, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} \times 1.5 = 18 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes. Since each dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 18 pounds per day, 40 dwarves can mine:
\[ 40 \times 18 = 720 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total ore mining for 30 days. Since 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 720 pounds per day, in 30 days they can mine:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price should be the same for all packages.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5. Now, we can calculate the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches:
- The cost for 8 sandwiches is:
  \[
  8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Initially, there are 25 red balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of them to burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released. Initially, there are 12 yellow balloons. Sally accidentally released half of them:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue added)} = 35 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher his dog ate the homework: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework in each scenario:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of getting an extension: 40% or 0.40
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

To find the total probability of not having to turn in homework, we sum the probabilities of the two scenarios:

\[ \text{Total probability of not having to turn in homework} = 0.50 + (0.50 \times 0.60) = 0.50 + 0.30 = 0.80 \]

Thus, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ \text{Probability of having to turn in homework} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.20 \times 100\% = 20\% \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The total capacity of the Fine Arts Center is 6000 seats. The number of seats reserved for graduates is 950 and for faculty is 300. Therefore, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out her net earnings after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:

\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it will take to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is:
\[
\frac{24}{3} = 8
\]
So, Richard will place 8 bottles along the driveway.

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, and there are 7 intervals between the 8 bottles, the total time is:
\[
7 \times 5 = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
2. Determine how many packs of eight apples can be made from the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples. Since Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples can be made from 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Since Amor buys 2 pounds, the total cost for Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 11 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 2 \text{ pounds} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Since Amor buys 3 pounds, the total cost for mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. After spending $40, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. Since it took him 4 years to finish college and he received $50,000 in loans per year, the total amount of loans he took out is:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income after graduating from college. His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled after he finished college, so his new income is:

\[ 3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college and instead worked the entire time. This would be his original income over the 4 years:

\[ 4 \text{ years} \times \$25,000 \text{ per year} = \$100,000 \]

The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000. The total amount of money he borrowed is $200,000. Therefore, the total amount of money he needs to earn to pay back his loans and make up for the income he lost while in college is:

\[ \$200,000 + \$100,000 = \$300,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take him to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year:

\[ \frac{\$300,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Each piece of fabric is an 8 feet by 10 feet rectangle. To find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply its length by its width:
\[
8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.**

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.

First, calculate one-fifth of the Monday's deliveries:
\[
\frac{425}{5} = 85
\]

Then, add 17 to this amount:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 102.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then, add 5 to this amount:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 209.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.**

Add the number of letters delivered on each day:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

For the chicken salad:
- Number of people: 10
- Cost per person: $6.50
- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 * $6.50 = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for both salads:
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to this, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars. Therefore, he did not lose any money in the second race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, we sum up the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

- Number of people in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 130000 \]

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Find the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since the painters worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day, the total number of hours worked by all painters in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} \times 4 \text{ painters} = 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \times 4 = 21 \times \frac{12}{8} = 21 \times \frac{3}{2} = 31.5 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we find the total number of hours worked by each painter. Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{31.5 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.875 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the price of the car at the end of each year from 2007 to 2010.

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's establish the number of sheets Greg needs to wash each week:
- A twin bed requires 2 twin sets of sheets.
- A king size bed requires 1 king set of sheets.
- Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed.

So, the total number of twin sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week is:
\[ 4 \text{ twin beds} \times 2 \text{ twin sets per twin bed} = 8 \text{ twin sets} \]

The total number of king sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week is:
\[ 1 \text{ king bed} \times 1 \text{ king set per king bed} = 1 \text{ king set} \]

Therefore, the total number of sheets Greg needs to wash each week is:
\[ 8 \text{ twin sets} + 1 \text{ king set} = 9 \text{ sets} \]

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do each week. The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. Since 9 sets include 4 twin sets and 1 king set, Greg can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in one load. This means he needs:
\[ \frac{9 \text{ sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load} + 1 \text{ king set per load}} = 4 \text{ loads} \]

Now, we calculate the number of loads Greg does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we sum these amounts:

- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total sum of his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- First 3 tests: 100 each
- 4th test: 80

The total sum of his scores is:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

The number of tests is 4. Therefore, the average score is:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{\text{Total sum of scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of these 40 pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ \text{Pizzas left for football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, we add the pizzas left for both the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate is \(7 - 4 = 3\).

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after the new order is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks.

Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures:

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
\text{Number of successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Thus, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 successful trucks is:

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \) of butter.

Next, we consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

To find out how many pounds Dennis needs to buy to get 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we can use the following logic:
- For every 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound.
- Therefore, to get 6 pounds, he needs to buy \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) pounds of butter.

Now, we calculate the cost:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Dennis needs to buy 12 pounds of butter.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 12 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$48.00 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 45\)

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Guests who could not come: 4
- Guests who will attend: \(45 - 4 = 41\)

The base rental fee for the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. Since 41 guests are attending, the number of additional guests is:

- Additional guests: \(41 - 20 = 21\)

The additional fee for the 21 additional guests is:

- Additional fee: \(21 \times 6 = 126\)

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party by adding the base rental fee and the additional fee:

- Total cost: \(125 + 126 = 251\)

Thus, the total cost for Kayla's party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially, so \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{85}

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. Therefore, she will receive $5 in change.

Now, we need to determine how much change she will receive in quarters. Since $5 is equivalent to 20 quarters (because $1 = 4 quarters, so $5 = 5 \times 4 = 20 quarters), Jenny will receive 20 quarters in change.

Thus, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes sold: 6

   - Total revenue from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Revenue from burger platters:**
   - Number of burger platters sold: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total revenue from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Revenue from sodas:**
   - Number of sodas sold: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total revenue from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\) dollars."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours, one spring will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."

"To determine the total time James took to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance from James's home to the halfway point: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the first segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance from the halfway point back to James's home: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the second segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Distance from James's home to the store: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the third segment: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \)

Now, we sum the times for all three segments to find the total time taken:

"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - **Trekking bikes:** Half of the total bikes sold are Trekking bikes.
     \[
     \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]
   - **BMX bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold are BMX bikes.
     \[
     \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
     \]
   - **MTB bikes:** The rest of the bikes sold are MTB bikes.
     \[
     \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
     \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - **Trekking bikes:** Each Trekking bike is sold for $450.
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
     \]
   - **BMX bikes:** Each BMX bike is sold for half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250.
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of periods John has each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Therefore, in 8 periods, he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - He goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, in 5 days, he spends \(5 \times 320 = 1600\) minutes each week.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - The total minutes spent learning each week is the sum of the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total minutes spent learning into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total hours spent learning each week is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling these bags at $5 per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of meat.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of meat.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas, which means there are 12 sodas in total. She shakes 3 of them, so there are now 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.

1. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself. This leaves 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{2+6} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(25\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest slide: 60 feet/minute

The time \( t_1 \) to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_1 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest slide: 80 feet/minute

The time \( t_2 \) to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_2 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = t_1 - t_2 = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After the return, the charge on the card is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance on the card:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are given that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[ T = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough money for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \) dollars.

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:
- She needs to save $40,000 per year for 20 years.
- Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Thus, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:

   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts is divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the final cut parts is 5 cm long.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.**
Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the required miles per day.**
To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in 30 days, Soledad needs to hike:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in the same period.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2 \times \text{Total distance Brian walks in 7 days} \]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian walks in 7 days. Then:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The total production rate is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

The four workers work for a 10-hour shift, so the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in that time is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

However, we calculated that the first four workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions, but based on the given information, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up the difference:
\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker works for the same 10-hour shift. Therefore, the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{20}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to find the total weight of both dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the current ages of Liam and Vince.

Liam's current age is 16 years.

Two years ago, Liam's age was:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years} \]

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's current age as \( V \). Therefore, two years ago, Vince's age was:
\[ V - 2 \]

According to the problem, we have the equation:
\[ 14 = 2 \times (V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve for \( V \):
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince's current age is 9 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah as:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted:
\[ S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]
Therefore, Camden painted 21 eggs. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, we can write:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A = 26 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, the difference is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]
Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each. Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box contains 8 crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box will weigh:

\[ 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons in the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes together gives:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can get is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:
\[ v \times 40 = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Number of marbles after losing 10} = 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. After this, the water in the water bottle is drinkable, meaning it must be at least 40 degrees.

The initial amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the initial amount of water from the unknown temperature mug is 1 ounce. After pouring, the temperature of the water in the water bottle is a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs, with the weights being the volumes of water poured.

The equation for the temperature of the water in the water bottle after the pour is:
\[
\frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T}{4 + 1} \geq 40
\]
Simplifying the equation:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]
Multiplying both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]
Subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]
Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

So, the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.

So, the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Number of cows added: 420
- Total number of cows: \( 50 + 420 = 470 \)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Number of chickens added: 210
- Total number of chickens: \( 20 + 210 = 230 \)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the discounted total cost is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell receives. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total discounted cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we calculate 3 less than 6:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since Gomer ate 18 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required for 18 scoops. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops (which is 9 times 2 scoops) will require:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:

\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days:

\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans and then subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans.

Given:
- Total number of jellybeans = 60
- Number of green jellybeans = 17
- Number of red jellybeans = 2 * number of green jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we can calculate the number of blue jellybeans:
Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first determine how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the problem, we know:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers were sold in 3 days:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 252 \text{ sunflowers} \]

"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:
  \[

   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \( P(\text{win first and win second}) = P(\text{win first}) \times P(\text{win second}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: \( 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \).

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we find \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided these seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, which are 2 days.

So, the total number of carrots eaten in a week is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total carrots} = (4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ weekdays}) + (5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ weekend days}) \]
\[ \text{Total carrots} = (4 \times 5) + (5 \times 2) \]
\[ \text{Total carrots} = 20 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Total carrots} = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

\[ \text{Additional time for the second song} = 5 \times \frac{60}{100} = 5 \times 0.6 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the duration of the second song is:

\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.**

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.**

Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.
\[ \text{Total cost} = (2 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.**

The total number of devices sold is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Isabel's height:**
   Isabel is 7 feet tall.

2. **Determine Ned's height:**
   Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we determine how many more bottles are needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The number of additional bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as the number of purple-wearers wearing bows divided by the total number of babies wearing bows, then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.

\[
\text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
66.67

"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Given:
- Total reports received last week = 5168
- Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
- Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

The number of reports received on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham initially owns, which is 80 square meters.

He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]
So, he earned $50 from selling 40 square meters.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]
So, he earned $30 from selling 20 square meters.

Now, let's calculate the remaining land after these sales. The total area sold so far is:
\[ 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ square meters} \]
Therefore, the remaining land is:
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. The total revenue from selling the remaining land is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up all the money he earned from selling the land:
\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day. According to the problem, he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day. Therefore, the number of times he changes his face mask in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ times/mask change} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ times/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times he changes his face mask in 2 days. Since he changes his face mask 6 times each day, in 2 days he will change his face mask:
\[ 6 \text{ times/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times} \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:
- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. So, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from each of the three complexes 3 times a week, so the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37. \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]
Adding 35 to both sides, we get:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]
Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars. Therefore, Rissa initially has 15 dollars and Ronnie has 5 dollars.

Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars. According to the problem, after giving away the money, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her initial amount. So we can write the equation:

\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12\]

From this, we can solve for \(x\):

\[15 - x = 12\]
\[x = 15 - 12 = 3\]

So, each of them gave 3 dollars to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had 5 dollars and he gave away 3 dollars, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

\[5 - 3 = 2\]

Therefore, the final amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

It is also given that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can write the equation for the total paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( W = R \) and \( P = R \) into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we sum up all the areas to find the total area of the house:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area} \]
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} \]

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box contains 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run with $1 if each cycle uses 1 pod. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

First, let's determine the goals scored by team B in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.

Next, we calculate the goals scored by team A in the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
- Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, so team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, we sum up the goals scored by each team in the entire match:
- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
\[6 + 10 = 16\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at the rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine the amount of chalk used on Monday. The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. Since the chalk started as a 5-inch piece, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:
\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]
This means the teacher has:
\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]
of chalk left at the end of Monday.

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it. Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk, so the amount of chalk left after each day can be calculated as follows:
- After the first day, the chalk left is:
\[ 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]
- After the second day, the chalk left is:
\[ 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]
- After the third day, the chalk left is:
\[ 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches} \]
- After the fourth day, the chalk left is:
\[ 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches} \]
- After the fifth day, the chalk left is:
\[ 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.89952 \text{ inches} \]
- After the sixth day, the chalk left is:
\[ 0.89952 \times 0.80 = 0.719616 \text{ inches} \]
- After the seventh day, the chalk left is:
\[ 0.719616 \times 0.80 = 0.5756928 \text{ inches} \]
- After the eighth day, the chalk left is:
\[ 0.5756928 \times 0.80 = 0.46055424 \text{ inches} \]
- After the ninth day, the chalk left is:
\[ 0.46055424 \times 0.80 = 0.368443392 \text{ inches} \]
- After the tenth day, the chalk left is:
\[ 0.368443392 \times 0.80 = 0.2947547136 \text{ inches} \]

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

The number of girls not on varsity is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

The number of boys not on varsity is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Finally, the total number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 8 \text{ girls} + 9 \text{ boys} = 17 \text{ students not on varsity} \]

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to find out how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (which is 5) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of teeth that James' dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth are fixed. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the refund amount is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we'll substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he spends $27,000 in total.

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100
\]

Now, we perform the calculation:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

So,

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Bob can buy 5400 books with $27,000. Since he has three schools to distribute the books among, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the cheese pizza = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the pepperoni pizza = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = \(\lceil \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} \rceil = \lceil 3 \rceil = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = \(\lceil \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} \rceil = \lceil 3 \rceil = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Since both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 pizzas, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon series came out, we can determine Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2. 

So, Jim's age at that time was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about how much time has passed since the series came out, we can only conclude that Jim was 14 years old when the series came out. Without additional information about the passage of time, we cannot determine Jim's current age. However, based on the information provided, Jim was 14 years old at the time the series came out.

The final numerical answer for Jim's age at the time the series came out is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces.
2. Doxa ate 1 slice.
3. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
4. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, we need to find the total number of slices they all ate together:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 3 slices.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \]

So, the total number of slices they all ate is 6.

"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**Day 1:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- So, at the end of Day 1, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

**Day 2:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than on Day 1, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- So, at the end of Day 2, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

**Day 3:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a bulk pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- So, at the end of Day 3, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\) bandages.

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered:

- They used 28 bandages on Day 2.
- They ordered 100 bandages on Day 3, but only used 25 of them.
- So, at the end of Day 3, they had \(22 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 79\) bandages.

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy in the problem statement or a need to recheck the conditions. However, based on the given conditions and the calculations, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 38.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25 \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Days per week} = 11.25 \times 6 = 67.5 \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April and Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the additional $10 for each of the 4 weeks:
\[ \text{Additional earnings for the month} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for the month of April:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks} + \text{Additional earnings for the month} = 67.5 \times 4 + 40 = 270 + 40 = 310 \]

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

1. For doing laundry: Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each laundry task. So, he earned $3.00.
2. For cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each cleaning task. So, he earned $1.50.
3. For taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each trash-out task. So, he earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
4. For emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each emptying task. So, he earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
$3.00 (from laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning room) + $1.50 (from taking trash) + $3.00 (from emptying dishwasher) = $9.00.

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information given, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to sum up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice this number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all these numbers to get the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of black pens were bought. According to the problem, Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we can find the total number of pens Alain has by adding the number of red pens and black pens together:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much each bottle of cognac costs. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:
\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining each day:

- **First Day:** Fred made 24 gallons.
- **Second Day:** After his children drank 4 gallons, the cooler had \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons. Then, Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons, so the cooler had \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons left.
- **Third Day:** Fred's friend Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, so the cooler had \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons left.
- **Fourth Day:** 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among them. Each person could drink \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons.

To find the final numerical answer:

\[
\frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}

"To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish:**
   - Total fish = 66
   - Fish with red stripes = 22
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Fish with red stripes = 22
   - Fish with blue stripes = 20
   \[
   \text{Total fish with red and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
   \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with 6 colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. So, the number of colors left after the theft is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, the number of colors left after using half of one makeup set is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor, which is:

\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Let's start with step 1:

Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells.
\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, step 2:
The remaining shells after team Alphas are:
\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

For step 3:
Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, step 4:
The number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells after both Alphas and The finders have taken their shares.
\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we need to follow the steps of the price changes one by one.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

2. **Price Increase in December:**
   In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. He has 4 such lessons:

\[
4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per hour} = \$320
\]

Next, we calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

\[
0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \text{ per hour}
\]

Charlie has 2 veteran lessons, so his earnings from these are:

\[
2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per hour} = \$120

3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sum all the scores**:
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

   So, the sum of all the scores is 630.

2. **Count the number of scores**: There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{630}{9} = 70
   \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of her original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
15
\]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

After eating 24 apples, the number of apples remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples remaining is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}
\]"
"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we need to solve for the number of novels this year. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{novels this year} = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, the total number of hours he travels is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Given his average speed is 50 km/hr, the total distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the total distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ 60\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Grapes Madeline ate**: 
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother**:
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother**:
   Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother**:
   Let \( x \) be the total number of grapes at the beginning. After Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the remaining grapes are:
   \[
   x - 36
   \]

5. **Grapes used to make pies**:
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

6. **Setting up the equation**:
   The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their share must equal the grapes used to make the pies:
   \[
   x - 36 = 48
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 48 + 36 = 84
   \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate this:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9 = 79 + 9 = 88

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

1. **Cost of pasta per week:**
   - The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost for pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of cheese per week:**
   - Cheddar cheese costs $3.00 per week.
   - Gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) per week.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost for cheese is $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $9.00.

3. **Total weekly cost:**
   - The total weekly cost for making macaroni and cheese is the sum of the cost of pasta and cheese.
   - Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00.

4. **Total yearly cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total yearly cost is \(52 \times 10.00 = 520.00\).

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

\[
\boxed{520.00}

"First, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours since the workday is measured in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage is not practically meaningful in the context of a workday, as it exceeds 100%. This result indicates that the custodian spends more than one full workday cleaning the school in 5 days, which is not realistic given the constraints. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 250\% \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we sum the capacities of all the shelves:
\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

Thus, the number of bookcases Elly needs is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: After removing the red hats, we have:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats remaining}
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, she needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 3 marbles plus the 5 he didn't lose, giving him a total of 3 + 5 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 2 flashlights for each room, and there are 8 rooms.
- Therefore, the number of flashlights for the rooms is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
- Adding the flashlights for the people, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, so half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
- In these 4 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
- Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs in the changing room, and then find the total number of items.

1. We know that there are 20 helmets.
2. According to the problem, the number of robots is half the number of helmets. Therefore, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]
3. The number of helmets is also given as 20.
4. The number of footballs is twice the number of helmets (since there are half as many helmets as footballs). Therefore, the number of footballs is:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs to find the total number of items:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim works in a week. Since he works 5 days a week and each day he works 6 hours, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total hours worked in a week into minutes, since the time it takes to deal with a call is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we know that it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he deals with in a week, we divide the total number of minutes he works in a week by the time it takes to deal with one call:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:

"To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, calculate the drying time for 6 paintings using the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, calculate the drying time for 6 paintings using the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, find the difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish:
- The difference is \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. Since half of the 200 yards is on land and the other half is in water, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His speed on land is 20 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{hop}} \) can be calculated as:
\[
t_{\text{hop}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His speed in water is 10 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{swim}} \) can be calculated as:
\[
t_{\text{swim}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time \( t_{\text{total}} \) for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{hop}} + t_{\text{swim}} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

2. Determine the number of days required to upload all the photos.

First, we know that Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the number of photos uploaded per day is:
\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first determine the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

Here's the breakdown of the weekly cost:
- Cost for 5 blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for 1 skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair of pants} = \$16.00\)

Now, we sum these amounts to find the weekly cost:
\[
\$25.00 + \$6.00 + \$16.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for 5 weeks:
\[
5 \text{ weeks} \times \$47.00 \text{ per week} = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{235.00}

"First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which means he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The number of people was twice the number from the second day, which means he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.
4. **Fourth Day to Sunday**: The average number of people seen each day over the remaining four days is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over these four days is \(4 \times 60 = 240\).

Now, we sum up the number of people seen over the entire week:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500\]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate halves, so \(0.5 \times 80 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the final number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade. Since the recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade, for 4 gallons, Tim needs 4 cups of lemon juice. Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of juice is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, consider the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. Since the extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice, it will also require 6 lemons.

Adding the lemons needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon, we get:
\[ 24 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then extend that to a weekly consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption:
- Total daily consumption = \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Total weekly consumption = \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

Thus, the Kennel will need \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of red blocks, we first need to determine the number of blue and yellow blocks.

Given:
- The tower has 4 blue blocks.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks.

Let's calculate the number of yellow blocks:
\[ \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} = 32 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the number of red blocks is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, find the net distance from his starting point:
- The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Number of pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

So, the number of pink candies is 43.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the total cost for both the hotel and the bus separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the bus. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the total cost for the bus is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the hotel and the bus:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars.

First, we know that the company produces 5000 bars per day. There are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we know that the company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140000} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store offers a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. This means that for every two T-shirts, Jake pays full price for one and 50% of the price for the other.

The price of one T-shirt is $8, so 50% off would be:
\[ 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \]

Thus, for two T-shirts, Jake pays:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is:
\[ 0.4 \times 40 = 16 \]

So, the price Jake pays for the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance. Since he earns $6 each week and he did his chores for 3 weeks, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left for the movie tickets:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide $13 by $6.50:
\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \text{ (with a remainder of 0.30)} \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, he can buy 2 movie tickets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 100 = 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent by both of them:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 per jar:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

So, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. With 32 quarters, the total value is:
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. With 95 dimes, the total value is:
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. With 120 nickels, the total value is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. With 750 pennies, the total value is:
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[
8.00 + 9.50 + 6.00 + 7.50 = 31.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31.00}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each, so for two tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:

\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the $40:

\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days Josh is open in a week.
2. Calculate the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Calculate his earnings over 2 weeks.

First, let's find out how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ days per week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, we calculate his earnings over 2 weeks:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. After these actions, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

So, the total number of cookies Randy has now is:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Adding these together, we get:
10 + 7 + 6 = 23

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to break down his collection into two equal parts and calculate the earnings from each part separately.

Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers. Therefore, each part of his collection consists of:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ toy soldiers} \]

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half of the collection and $7 per toy for the second half. So, we calculate the earnings from each part as follows:

For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both parts gives the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time and then determine how long it takes to fill all the holes.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug = \(6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\).

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day at night. The net change in the number of holes per day is:
- Net change per day = \(9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day}\).

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes:
- Number of days to fill 84 holes = \(\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}\).

Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks:
- Number of weeks = \(\frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}\).

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

Given:
- Total cookies made = 7995
- Rainbow cookies = 2595
- Oatmeal cookies = 3075

The number of chocolate chip cookies can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - (\text{Rainbow cookies} + \text{Oatmeal cookies}) \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - (2595 + 3075) \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 5670 \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\)
- Petri dishes: \(14 + 2 = 16\)
- Beakers: 7 (correct number)

The total number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29. We can set up an equation to find out how many beakers Igor lost. Let \(x\) be the number of beakers Igor lost. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes he had:

\[8 + 7 + 16 - x = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[31 - x = 29\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 31 - 29 = 2\]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket.

Given:
- There are 10 eggs in the first basket.
- There are twice as many eggs in the second basket as in the first basket.

First, calculate the number of eggs in the second basket:
\[
\text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Next, add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:
\[
\text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Number of eggs in the first basket} + \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 10 + 20 = 30

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Therefore,

\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Since Aaron and Vanessa were partners and ran the same distance in total, the distance Aaron ran is half of the total distance they ran together. Let's denote the total distance they ran together as \( D \). Then,

\[ D_A = \frac{D}{2} \]

Given that \( D_A = A \times 16 \), we can substitute \( D_A \) in the equation:

\[ A \times 16 = \frac{D}{2} \]

Since \( D = 4 \) miles (the distance Vanessa ran), we substitute \( D \) with 4:

\[ A \times 16 = \frac{4}{2} \]
\[ A \times 16 = 2 \]
\[ A = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we know \( A = \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute. Since \( A = 2V \), we can find \( V \):

\[ \frac{1}{8} = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{1}{8} \div 2 = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles. The time \( T_V \) it took Vanessa to run 4 miles is given by:

\[ T_V = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed for the dock:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line the caretaker already has:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 594 \]"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

- Tom's restaurant orders 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine per reservation.
- The cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- The cost of the bottle of wine is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the revenue per night:
- They get 6 reservations per night.
- The revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the weekly revenue:
- They are open 2 days a week.
- The weekly revenue is \(2 \times 90 = 180\) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's determine the current age of James. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, Dora's current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]
Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine John's current age. We know that John had a son James when he was 19, and James is currently 18. Therefore, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the age of John's youngest son is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]
In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Thus, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the installation cost is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the installation cost to find the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{470} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
