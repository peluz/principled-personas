"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and then multiply that by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has each day:
- The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs to make muffins.

The number of eggs remaining after breakfast and muffins is:
\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. Each egg sells for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve this, we first need to understand the quantities of each type of fiber required for the robe.

Given:
- A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.

Let's calculate the amount of white fiber needed:
- Half of 2 bolts of blue fiber is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the quantities of both types of fiber to find the total:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber needed:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after the repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000. Josh then added $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.

To find the increased value of the house, we calculate 150% of $80,000 and add it to the original value:

\[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value:

\[ \text{New value of the house} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, Josh sells the house for the new value of $200,000. He initially invested $80,000 (original house price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total investment from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is $70,000."
"To calculate the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters he runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so the total meters for one sprint in a week is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters he runs in one week for all sprints:**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens. Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed. This is for 20 chickens, so:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 300 \text{ cups} \]

In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. This is also for 20 chickens, so:
\[ 25 \text{ cups} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 500 \text{ cups} \]

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 300 \text{ cups} + 500 \text{ cups} = 800 \text{ cups} \]

Since the total amount of feed given in a day is 800 cups, and the total feed for the day is 800 cups, the amount of feed given in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 800 \text{ cups} - 800 \text{ cups} = 0 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, given that the first glass costs $5 and every second glass costs only 60% of $5.

First, let's determine the cost of every second glass:
- The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's break down the cost for 16 glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

We can see that the cost pattern is $5, $3, $5, $3, and so forth. This means that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs:
- The total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is $64."
"To solve the problem, we will first determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep in All Cities:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Toulouse's Sheep} + \text{Charleston's Sheep} + \text{Seattle's Sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.4 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.6 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Time for the first 40% + Time for the update + Time for the remaining 60% = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
- Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{First month downloads} = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 70% of the downloads in the second month (since it reduced by 30%):
\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost of the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- The total cost is \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost is 694 dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue from lemons - Annual cost of maintenance
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):

\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree. 

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):

\[
2x = 36
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."

3. **Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

4. **Calculate the remaining students after those enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 16 - 4 = 12 students.

5. **The remaining students are those enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - 12 students.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the value of the jewelry and the electronic gadgets after the respective market increases, and then compare the two.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[
\text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[
\text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we compare the two values to determine which purchase would yield a higher profit:
\[
\text{Profit from jewelry} = 5125 - 5000 = 125
\]
\[
\text{Profit from electronic gadgets} = 8096 - 8000 = 96
\]

Since the profit from purchasing the jewelry is higher, the merchant should choose to purchase the jewelry. The maximum profit the merchant can achieve is:
\[
\boxed{125}
\]"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction.

First, the distance traveled westward is 80 miles.
Second, the distance traveled northward is 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from teaching per year = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from coaching per year = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Finally, we sum up her earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary.

Let's calculate these values:

Earnings from teaching per year = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Earnings from coaching per year = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs Claire consumes in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

First, we know that Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so the number of eggs she uses in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we need to determine the total time she should take to cover the entire distance.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles, we can calculate the total time she should take:
\[ 4 \text{ miles/hour} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, which totals 2 hours. Therefore, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours (total time)} - 2 \text{ hours (already spent)} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles (total distance)} - 4 \text{ miles (first part)} - 2 \text{ miles (second part)} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of 24 liters of liquid. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we only have 9 liters of orange drink left.

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of liquid is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Water from the orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- Water from the pineapple drink: 9 liters.

Adding these together gives:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \] liters of water.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters. The final numerical answer is:

"The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length over 4 hours would be:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the following equation. Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. Given that Kyle bought the book with a 25% discount, he paid 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

"To solve this, let's first calculate the total cost of the items Marie has already accounted for:

- One chicken meal costs $12.
- Five packs of milk at $3 each cost \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Four apples at $1.50 each cost \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these up, the total cost for the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To calculate the total amount Mishka spent, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

Therefore, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then determine the cost based on the number of cartons she will need to buy.

First, we calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[
60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

Next, we determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[
4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means his second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance at his second stop and the distance at his first stop. Therefore, the distance traveled between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33. The cost of the second pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To calculate the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. Therefore, the total time spent on dogs per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on dogs in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35 hours."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as \( R \). Therefore, \( R = 40 \).

Next, we know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Let's denote the number of jewels Aaron has as \( A \). According to the problem, \( A = \frac{1}{2}R + 5 \). Substituting the value of \( R \) into this equation, we get:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25. \]
So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = A - 2 \). Substituting the value of \( A \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = 25 - 2 = 23. \]
So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, 25% more points is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]
Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 5 points.

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Therefore, the total cost for 60 yogurts is 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

The final numerical answer is $75.00."
"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his Lego sets.
2. Calculate the total amount of money John spends on video games.
3. Determine the total amount of money John has after selling his Lego sets and buying the video games.
4. Use the information about the leftover money to find out how much money John had initially.
5. Subtract the number of Lego sets he has already sold from the total number of Lego sets he originally had.

Let's start with the first step:

1. John sells 13 Lego sets at $15 each.
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195
   \]
   So, John earns $195 from selling his Lego sets.

2. John buys 8 video games at $20 each.
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160
   \]
   So, John spends $160 on video games.

3. John has $5 left after these transactions.
   \[
   \text{Total money after selling and buying} = 195 - 160 + 5 = 39
   \]
   So, John has $39 after these transactions.

4. Since John initially had $195 (from selling the Lego sets) and he has $39 left after buying the video games, we can determine how much money he had initially:
   \[
   \text{Initial money} = 195 - 39 = 156
   \]
   This means John had $156 initially.

5. Since John sold all 13 Lego sets, he has 0 Lego sets left.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and divide it by the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week, and the times he runs are as follows:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: half as much as the first day, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours
- Third day: half as much as the first day, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours

The total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speeds at which Dana can run and walk, and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the distribution of her time spent running and walking.

First, let's find Dana's running speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent running and walking as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can travel running in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance she can travel walking in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Ben's iPhone Age:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Given:
- Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
- With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

Let's calculate the distance with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = \text{Distance with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones initially had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces was:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in a single serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories you can still consume in a day to meet your target of 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories:

\[ \text{Servings you can eat} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams you can eat are:

\[ \text{Total grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 1 pound of beeswax is $10.00, so the cost of 2 pounds is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

In addition to the cost of the beeswax, Charlie also needs to pay for the wicks, which cost $10.00 in total. Therefore, the total cost of making 20 candles is:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 40 - 30 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we will calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then sum the hours spent on each day.

First, we know that Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. The time spent on each article is 4 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on Monday is:
\[ 5 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Since she wrote 5 articles on Monday, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]
The total time spent on Tuesday is:
\[ 7 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 28 \text{ hours} \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]
The total time spent on Wednesday is:
\[ 14 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 56 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the hours spent over the three days:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 28 \text{ hours} + 56 \text{ hours} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.

First, let's establish the initial number of post-it notes Candice had:
\[ 80 \]

Next, let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

After purchasing the package, the total number of post-it notes she had is:
\[ 80 + x \]

Candice used some of these post-it notes to place one on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, the number of post-it notes she used is:
\[ 220 \]

After using 220 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. Thus, the equation representing the total number of post-it notes she had before using any is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of occupied units. Given that 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per week.
2. Convert the weekly egg production into dozens.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Therefore, the number of eggs produced per week is:
\[ 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the weekly egg production into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens produced per week is:
\[ \frac{1764 \text{ eggs/week}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 147 \text{ dozens/week} \]

Now, we calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, the weekly revenue is:
\[ 147 \text{ dozens/week} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know that he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

First, we need to determine the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time required is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the difference in revenue between the days, I will first calculate the total revenue for Thursday and then for Friday, and finally find the difference.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each costing $60, so the revenue from truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tires is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- The total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tires is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is \(0 + 480 = 480\) dollars.

Now, to find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- The difference is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

First, we know that the two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. According to the information given, Patchy has had three times the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we can calculate the number of Patchy's kittens as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of Patchy's kittens and Trixie's kittens to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has:

\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum additional weight that can be added to the truck is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be added, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

First, we start with the original bill amount:
\[ \text{Original bill} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we add the 25% delivery fee to the original bill. To find 25% of $40.00:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

Adding this delivery fee to the original bill:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

2. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year. The value of her pension at this point is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.
3. For the next 10 years (from year 21 to year 30), she receives 5% of $1,000,000 per year, which is $50,000.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $50,000.

Let's confirm this with a simple calculation:

- For the first 20 years: $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.
- For the next 10 years: 5% of $1,000,000 = $50,000/year.

Thus, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half-year, and the service charges $140 per month, the cost for the first half of the year is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The service charges 10% less per month during the second half of the year. Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]
The cost for the second half of the year is then:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs of the two halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate the total amount of gas in her tank when it is full. According to the owner's manual, her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. She has already used 4 gallons, so the remaining amount of gas in the tank is:

12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons

Sophia has already traveled 100 miles with the 4 gallons of gas she used. To find out how many miles she can drive per gallon, we divide the distance traveled by the amount of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive with the full tank of 12 gallons, we multiply the number of miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's determine the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jim repeats this 3 times a week, so the total time spent in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the players and coaches from both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has:
- 5 players on the girls' team
- 5 players on the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school sends:
\[ 5 \text{ (girls' players)} + 5 \text{ (boys' players)} + 1 \text{ (girls' coach)} + 1 \text{ (boys' coach)} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are four schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \text{ (schools)} \times 12 \text{ (people per school)} = 48 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"To find the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds to find the total number of gems:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

Thus, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is:
\[
\boxed{595}

"Let's denote the number of girls as \( G \) and the number of boys as \( B \). According to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls, so we can write:

\[ B = 2G \]

Given that there are 60 girls, we can substitute \( G \) with 60:

\[ B = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

So, there are 120 boys at the school. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:

\[ \text{Total students} = B + G = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

The problem states that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers \( T \) can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by 5:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Total students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Thus, the number of teachers is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she received from her weekly allowance over the 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount of money she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the $40 she received from her allowance. Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- Judy teaches 5 classes every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
  \]
- Judy also teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
  \[
  25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students.
  \[
  33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
  \[
  495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}

Adding these amounts together gives us the total money raised:
$129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises $221."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide this total by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit:
\[ 2\% \text{ of } \$750 = 0.02 \times \$750 = \$15 \]

Now, we add the interest to the original cost to get the total installment amount:
\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total installment amount by 3:
\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) each month for 3 months."
"To calculate the total amount Artie will make, we first need to round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then multiply by the number of pots sold.

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Now, we calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, we add up the total revenue from all the flowers:

Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

Therefore, Artie will make $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, Level 3 has \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: Level 2 has half the square footage of Level 3, so it has \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: Level 1 has half the square footage of Level 2, so it has \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level: 16, 8, 4, and 2.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is 7.5."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life. Since the problem does not specify the duration of the puppy's life, we assume the rest of its life is beyond the first year. For the sake of this calculation, we will consider the first year only and assume the puppy lives for more than a year.

For the first year, the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day. The number of days in a year is 365 (assuming a non-leap year):
- The total amount of dog food needed for the first year is:
  \[
  2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 365 \, \text{days} = 730 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Now, we add the dog food required for the first 180 days and the first year:
- Total dog food required:
  \[
  180 \, \text{cups} + 730 \, \text{cups} = 910 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Finally, we determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups:
- Number of bags needed:
  \[
  \frac{910 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 8.2727
  \]

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number:
- Number of bags Cecilia will use:
  \[
  \lceil 8.2727 \rceil = 9
  \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, and then find the difference between the two.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does as follows:
\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does as follows:
\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. The original cost of the grooming is $100, and the discount is 30%.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 30 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"Two girls each got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, which means each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \) liters. Therefore, the two girls together got \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) liters of water.

A boy then got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken is \( 8 + 6 = 14 \) liters.

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. After the girls and the boy took their share, the amount of water left is \( 24 - 14 = 10 \) liters.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 10."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games."

"First, let's determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. 

To find out how many guests don't show up, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 guests don't show up. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. Since she is inviting 16 friends, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed:
\[ 16 \times 0.75 = 12 \]

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Christina will spend $24 on gift bags.

"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount of potato salad consumed by the adults and then by the children.

1. **Calculate the potato salad consumption by adults:**
   - Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total potato salad for adults = 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.

2. **Calculate the potato salad consumption by children:**
   - Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total potato salad for children = 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.

3. **Calculate the total potato salad needed:**
   - Total potato salad = Potato salad for adults + Potato salad for children
   - Total potato salad = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add the number of pets each has:

- Cindy: 4 pets
- Marcia: 6 pets
- Jan: 18 pets

Total number of pets = \(4 + 6 + 18 = 28\)

The final numerical answer is 28."
"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Amy's age = A
- Jackson's age = J
- Corey's age = C
- James' age = 10

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, we can solve for Corey's age using the third relationship:
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now, using the second relationship, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Finally, using the first relationship, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ J = A - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we are informed that Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his new diet. This means that Gerald's new time to run the 400-meter hurdles will be 10% longer than his original time. To find the new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and add it to the original time:

\[ \text{Improvement in time} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 + 4 = 44 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 44 seconds. The final numerical answer is:

"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats can be calculated as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, we first calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:

Number of dogs and cats combined = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Number of dogs and cats combined = 60 + 120
Number of dogs and cats combined = 180

Now, the number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Number of dogs and cats combined - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we calculate:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \)."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

She receives 18 more potted plants from her nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. This means she will give away:

\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is 58."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Let's denote the number of times the fourth friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_4 \). So, \( F_4 = 60 \).

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Let's denote the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_3 \). Therefore, \( F_3 = F_4 + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 \).

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_1 \). So, \( F_1 = 20 \). The second friend pressed the doorbell \( F_2 = F_1 + \frac{1}{4}F_1 = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \).

Now, we have the number of doorbell rings from each friend:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

To find the total number of doorbell rings, we sum these values:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first sum up the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 days left to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
Pages per day = 39 pages / 4 days

Now, let's calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day:

Pages per day = 39 / 4 = 9.75 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 9.75 pages per day."
"To determine the number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks one glass of water with each meal:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner

He has three meals a day, so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day during weekdays.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of glasses of water he drinks during weekdays is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks one glass of water with dinner, but instead of soda, he has a soda. Therefore, he drinks 1 glass of water on each of the 2 weekend days.

So, the total number of glasses of water he drinks during weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks during weekdays and weekends, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 17 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 17 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Given that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate the total time required as follows:

1. Determine the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to cover all 14 segments:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   So, 750 pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   So, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{500}

"To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of a single box and then multiply it by three.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is therefore:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has three such boxes, the total inner volume of all three boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all three boxes is 108 cubic inches."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday, and then subtract the hours he watched on the other days.

Here's the breakdown of the hours he watched TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these up:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \]

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

Henry then drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

Thus, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more, we can verify the calculation:

\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he has:

\[ 115 - 5 = 110 \]

This confirms that the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year is indeed 50. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to calculate the total cost of the gas without the cashback, and then subtract the total cashback.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtracting the total cashback from the total cost of the gas gives us the final amount after the cashback rewards:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount after the cashback rewards is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to calculate the area of their respective unrolled fruit roll-ups.

Marcell's fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice combined:
\[ 42 + 48 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of water the boat took on as Julia rowed back to the shore.

First, we need to find out how many seconds it took Julia to row 64 seconds away from the shore. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate of her rowing:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we can find out how many seconds it took her to row 64 feet:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 feet} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}} = 64 \times \frac{4}{5} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water the boat took on during this time. The boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of water taken on per second:

\[ \text{Water per second} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times \frac{1 \text{ second}}{\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times \frac{4 \text{ seconds}}{5 \text{ feet}} = \frac{8 \text{ liters}}{50 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{4 \text{ liters}}{25 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on during the 51.2 seconds:

\[ \text{Total water} = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{4 \text{ liters}}{25 \text{ seconds}} = 51.2 \times \frac{4}{25} = 51.2 \times 0.16 = 8.192 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 8.192 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the quantities given and use them to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

First, let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \).

From the problem, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 6B = 1800 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

We can write the relationship as:
\[ B = 50D \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we solve the equation:
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is:

"To calculate the profit Sasha makes, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she has and the total revenue she would receive from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10. So, the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16. So, the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

The total cost of the lumber is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- She sells all ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each at the same price as when she bought them, which is $10. So, the total revenue from these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- She also sells all five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each at the same price as when she bought them, which is $16. So, the total revenue from these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

The total revenue from selling the lumber is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

The profit Sasha makes is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the total amount used is the sum of these two quantities:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially imported is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years ago and then calculate their salaries four years later.

First, let's find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000 and that this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write the equation:
\[ 40,000 = L \times 1.30 \]

To find \( L \), we solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = 30,769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. We know that four years later, Adrien's salary was 40% higher than his salary four years ago. Therefore, his new salary is:
\[ 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we will calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.

4. **Thursday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Wednesday, so she slept \(4 - 2 = 2\) hours.

5. **Friday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than Thursday, so she slept \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

6. **Saturday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than Friday, so she slept \(3 + 1 = 4\) hours.

7. **Sunday:**
   Sadie slept 1 hour more than Saturday, so she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[
8 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two periods:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"Let's denote the number of letters that Jennie had already stamped when she began as \( x \).

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) letters.

After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters needing stamps is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

We are told that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped plus the 20 new ones equals 30. Therefore, the number of letters that were already stamped is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, when Jennie began, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Thus, the answer is:

10"
"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

Julia's husband gave her 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \).

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left was \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \).

When Julia went to set the table, she had 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

First, let's find the cost of each pepper:
- Each pepper costs $15.

Next, we calculate the cost of a watermelon:
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
- Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the cost of an orange:
- An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
- Therefore, the cost of an orange is \( 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the fruits Dillon is buying:
- Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, so the total cost for watermelons is \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \) dollars.
- Dillon is buying 20 peppers, so the total cost for peppers is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) dollars.
- Dillon is buying 10 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the total cost for all the fruits:
- Total cost = cost of watermelons + cost of peppers + cost of oranges
- Total cost = \( 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\)."
"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients' visits:

1. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
2. The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
3. Therefore, the revenue from each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.
4. With 500 patients a day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the doctors' services:

1. Each doctor is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
2. The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
3. Therefore, the cost to the hospital from each doctor is $150 * 0.4 = $60.
4. Assuming there is one doctor per patient (as the question does not specify otherwise), the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

Thus, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"Initially, Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of these elves quit after children vomit on them. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, the number of elves remaining after this is:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Thus, the final number of elves left is 30."
"In June, Joseph's expenditure was $500 - $60 = $440.

Therefore, his total expenditure for May and June was $500 + $440 = $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we need to calculate the tickets used for each ride and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the tickets Pam used:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster rides are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge rides are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Pam are \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster rides are \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge rides are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Fred are \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Finally, we sum the tickets used by Pam and Fred:
- Total tickets used by Pam and Fred are \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

Thus, the total number of tickets they used that day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the miles he walked on Tuesday and then use the total mileage for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

The total mileage for Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can now calculate the miles he walked on Wednesday by subtracting the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:
\[ 13 \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we first need to determine the number of car washes he gets in a year and then multiply that by the cost per car wash.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of car washes in a year is:

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Each car wash costs $15, so the total cost for the year is:

\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$720/\text{year} \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is \$720."
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

\[
\text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the items Rory ordered:

- Subs: 2 subs at $7.50 each = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
- Chips: 2 bags at $1.50 each = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
- Cookies: 2 cookies at $1.00 each = 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:

Total cost of items = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:

Total cost with delivery fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total cost with the delivery fee:

Total cost with tip = $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

$29.00"
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
- The first test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the first test is:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
- The second test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the second test is:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

Thus, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, we have the relationship:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ 20\% \]

Let's confirm this with a Python code snippet.
```python
# Total number of cars
total_cars = 20

# Number of automatic cars
automatic_cars = 12

# Number of manual cars
manual_cars = 4

# Calculate the number of semi-automatic cars
semi_automatic_cars = total_cars - automatic_cars - manual_cars

# Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars
percentage_semi_automatic = (semi_automatic_cars / total_cars) * 100
percentage_semi_automatic
```
```output
Done

The percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is \( \boxed{20\%} \)."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total number of hours he would work in a week and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

First, we know that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he would work in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we know that Jordan earns $10 per hour. Therefore, the total amount of money he would earn in one week is:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 140 \]"
"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups.

The cost of nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

The total cost of nonfood items before tax is:
3 + 4 = 7 dollars

The tax on nonfood items is 10% of the total cost of nonfood items:
10% of 7 dollars = 0.10 * 7 = 0.70 dollars

The total cost of nonfood items including tax is:
7 + 0.70 = 7.70 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars

The total cost of food items is:
2 + 3 + 3 = 8 dollars

Adding the cost of food items and the cost of nonfood items including tax:
8 + 7.70 = 15.70 dollars

Therefore, the total cost is 15.70 dollars."
"To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total expenses and then subtract them from the total income.

Each client requires:
- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, which totals $4 per client.
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each, which totals $5 per client.

Therefore, the total cost per client is $4 + $5 = $9.

Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8.

The total expenses for 8 clients is 8 * $9 = $72.

The total income is given as $92.

The profit is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare in a year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvest cycles in a year. Therefore, the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Next, since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's sum up the total number of lego pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

Therefore, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** 
   - Initial population: 0 (assuming no bees initially).
   - After 30 bees leave: 0.
   - After 15 bees return: 15.
   - After 60 bees leave: 15 - 60 = -45 (indicating a deficit of 45 bees, which is not possible in reality, but we'll continue with the calculation).
5. **Bee population at the end of the fourth 6-hour period:** 
   - All bees that left before this period return: 60 bees return.
   - Final population: 60 (since all bees that left before this period return).

Now, we need to find out how many bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours. According to the problem, all bees that left before this period return in the last 6 hours. Since 60 bees left in the previous periods, all 60 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 60."
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for one adult ticket and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of Dorothy's Facebook friends. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Tim will be the winner since he takes less time to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Steve) finishes the race."
"To calculate the earnings, we need to determine the total cost of inflating the tires for all the vehicles that came by.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the cost to inflate the tires of one bicycle is:
\[ 2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Since 5 people came with bicycles, the total cost for the bicycles is:
\[ 5 \text{ bicycles} \times 50 \text{ cents per bicycle} = 250 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the cost to inflate the tires of one tricycle is:
\[ 3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 75 \text{ cents} \]

Since 3 people came with tricycles, the total cost for the tricycles is:
\[ 3 \text{ tricycles} \times 75 \text{ cents per tricycle} = 225 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire, and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the cost to inflate the tire of one unicycle is:
\[ 1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Since 1 person came with a unicycle, the total cost for the unicycle is:
\[ 1 \text{ unicycle} \times 25 \text{ cents per unicycle} = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the vehicles:
\[ 250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

Total number of cookies = 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Carl buys 60 cookies.

Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00.

Finally, let's determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.00.

Change received = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

"Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

Dave ate 14 fries. The seagull stole the pack, and then Dave's consumption was halved, meaning the seagull ate 7 fries. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

The raccoon then stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) \) fries. The remaining fries after the raccoon ate were \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).

Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

Thus, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 48 \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the weekly hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both groups of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays + hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Total weekly hours = 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Finally, we multiply the total weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total hours for the semester:
- Total semester hours = total weekly hours \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total semester hours = 17 \(\times\) 16 = 272 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of all the baked goods in inches and then convert that length to feet.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
- Total length in inches = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
- Total length in inches = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
- Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the total length in feet is \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in the zoo per month, and then multiply that by 2.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Next, we sum the monthly requirements for all the apes:
\[
200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month}
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of bananas required for 2 months:
\[
700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs the entire length of the field twice (back and forth), so each round trip is 200 yards. Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 80 yards. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Raphael spent, we need to sum the cost of each item he purchased.

The cost of the pens is:
4 pens * $1.5 per pen = $6

The cost of the notebooks is:
2 notebooks * $4 per notebook = $8

The cost of the rim of bond paper is:
$20

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
$6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent on everything is $34."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. When 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. Then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we first need to determine the depth of the water on Tuesday and then calculate the depth on Wednesday based on that.

On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the depth of the water is 7 feet more than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we first need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by each of them.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Finally, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine the number of price increases that occur in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases is:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Let the original price of the bag of marbles be \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars. After each price increase, the new price \( P_n \) is given by:
\[ P_n = P_{n-1} \times (1 + 0.20) = P_{n-1} \times 1.20 \]

We need to find the price after 18 increases. The price after \( n \) increases can be expressed as:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \):
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

Therefore, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{209.76} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the cost of a red car and a doll.

Given that one red car costs $4, and a doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of the doll as follows:

1. Let the cost of one action figure be $5.
2. Therefore, the cost of 3 action figures is $5 * 3 = $15.
3. Hence, the doll costs $15.

Now, we know the cost of a red car is $4 and a doll is $15. We need to find the total cost of all the toys:

- Red cars: 5 cars * $4/car = $20
- Action figures: 3 figures * $5/figure = $15
- Doll: $15

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour for each hour she does not do freelance work. If we assume she has a certain number of hours available for freelance work, let's denote the number of hours she could do freelance work as \( H \).

If she does her own taxes, she will lose \( 3H \) in missed income because she will be unable to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work. The missed income can be calculated as:
\[ 3H \times 35 \]

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90. To find out how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. However, the problem does not specify the number of hours \( H \) she could do freelance work. Without this information, we can only express the missed income in terms of \( H \).

If we assume \( H = 10 \) (for example), then the missed income would be:
\[ 3 \times 10 \times 35 = 1050 \]

Since the cost of hiring the accountant is $90, the difference in missed income is:
\[ 1050 - 90 = 960 \]

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $960 more. However, since the problem does not specify \( H \), the final numerical answer in terms of \( H \) is:
\[ 3H \times 35 - 90 \]

If we assume \( H = 10 \), the final numerical answer is:
\[ 960 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{960} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left for her clothing is:

€1500 - €509 = €991

The amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Thus, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather the required 45 eggs for making 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is $8 * 2 = $16. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

The final numerical answer is $18."
"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. On weekdays, he walks 20 miles each day, and on weekends, he walks 10 miles each day.

So, the total miles walked on weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

The total miles walked on weekends is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these together gives the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, which is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[25 + 75 + 50 = 150\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the legs from the spiders:
- There are 80 spiders.
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the spiders is \(80 \times 8 = 640\).

Next, we calculate the legs from the insects:
- There are 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the insects is \(90 \times 6 = 540\).

Then, we calculate the legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:
- There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
- Each invertebrate has 10 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the invertebrates is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Finally, we sum the legs from all the creatures:
- The total number of legs is \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\).

Thus, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's first establish the ages of the birds based on the information provided:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will take to peel and cut all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the time taken for each task and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time taken to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time taken to peel is:
  \[
  60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time taken to cut is:
  \[
  60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ seconds}
  \]

Now, we need to convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute.
- Therefore, 300 seconds is:
  \[
  \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we sum the time taken to peel and the time taken to cut:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95}

"To solve this, we need to determine the total cost Juan and Carlos spent on lemons given their profit and the cost of ingredients.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:
- They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
- Each glass is sold for $0.50.
- Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.

Next, we know their profit is $25. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Let's denote the total cost as \(C\).

Given the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - C \]

Solving for \(C\):
\[ C = 10 - 25 \]
\[ C = -15 \]

This negative value indicates an error in our interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the cost structure and the profit equation.

The total cost \(C\) includes the cost of lemons and sugar:
- Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
- Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
- Total cost per gallon: \(3 + 2 = 5\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons they sold to make a $25 profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 10 - 5G \]
\[ 15 = -5G \]
\[ G = -3 \]

This negative value also indicates an error. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Given the profit equation:
\[ 25 = 10 - 5G \]
\[ 15 = 5G \]
\[ G = 3 \]

So, they sold 3 gallons to make a $25 profit. Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 gallons:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are told that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To solve this problem, I will follow the steps outlined:

1. Calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent.
2. Calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel.
3. Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Zaid's salary is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500$
   \]

2. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000$
   \]

3. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$
   \]

4. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
   \[
   \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250$
   \]

5. The remaining amount after the charity donation:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250$
   \]

6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350$
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"To solve the problem, let's first establish the number of crabs each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Bo's Crabs:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's Crabs:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Rani's Crabs:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs}
\]
\[
\text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46
\]

Adding these together:
\[
40 + 36 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}

"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then sum the results.

For the first week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

From the information given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4W \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5W = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( W \):
\[ 5W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, let's determine Mark's age. Since Jan is 30 years old, half of Jan's age is 15. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 15, which means Mark was 20 years old two years ago. Therefore, Mark's current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

Now, since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final numerical answer is 24."
"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two separate events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \). 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:

\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:

\[ \text{Interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:

\[ \text{Total amount to be paid} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Thus, Mandy should give Benedict $106."
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of purchasing the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is \( 2n \) dollars.

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the purchase cost and the transportation cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells all the bags at a rate of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ 400 = 30n - 22n \]
\[ 400 = 8n \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total amount spent by the three friends.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend paid:
$102 / 3 = $34.

Thus, the final numerical answer is $34."
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we need to calculate the product of the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches and the number of peaches he collects per minute.

John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes he spends collecting peaches is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for all the ducks combined.

Given that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Insects per day for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day for ten ducks, we multiply the amount needed per day for one duck by ten:

\[ \text{Insects per day for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \times 10 = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year, and then apply the 30% mortality rate after 10 years.

First, let's determine the net increase in the number of trees each year:
- Tom plants 10 trees.
- Tom chops down 2 trees.
- Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase:
- Initial number of trees = 50.
- Net increase over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
- Total number of trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Next, we need to account for the 30% mortality rate after 10 years:
- 30% of the trees die, so 70% of the trees remain.
- Number of trees remaining = 130 trees * 0.70 = 91 trees.

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the neighbors took back and painted 6 flamingos:**
   - Remaining pink flamingos: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
   - New white flamingos: 6

4. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - Total pink flamingos: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)
   - Total white flamingos: 6

5. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

6. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the crayons is 5 * $2 = $10. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. The change she will get is $20 - $10 = $10. 

The final numerical answer is $10."
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has, we will calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

5. **Total number of cards:**
   We sum the cards collected over the three months and add the initial number of cards.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

First, we know that Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Thus, the earnings from Publisher B are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the water he gets in the morning and the afternoon, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the water Baldur gets in the morning:
- He gets 5 pails of water every morning.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

So, the total water he gets in the morning is:
\[ 5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the water Baldur gets in the afternoon:
- He gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

So, the total water he gets in the afternoon is:
\[ 6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we sum the water he gets in the morning and the afternoon to find the total amount of water he gets every day:
\[ 25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate the total salary increase for the entire year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- The total raise for the year is \( 100 \times 52 = 5200 \) dollars.

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total raise:
- Total reward amount is \( 5000 + 5200 = 10200 \) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total salary for the year:
- John's weekly salary is $2000.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- The total salary for the year is \( 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \) dollars.

Adding the total reward to the total salary:
- Total amount made in the year is \( 104000 + 10200 = 114200 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is 114200 dollars."

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year:
   - Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
   - Josie has 10 acres.
   - Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is \( 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \).

2. Calculate the total barrels of wine produced per year:
   - Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.
   - Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year is \( 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \).

Thus, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for the sandwiches. He ate a sandwich every day for the week, which is 7 days. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for the sandwiches is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for the omelets. He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese. He made omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for the omelets is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese for it. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for the macaroni and cheese is:
\[ 8 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[ 14 \text{ slices} + 9 \text{ slices} + 8 \text{ slices} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. Therefore, the total number of blue pens is:

\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens/bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens/bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens to these, we get:

\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her first five test scores and then determine the score required on the sixth test.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:

\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). The average of the six test scores will be:

\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} \]

We want this average to be 93, so we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Then, we subtract 440 from both sides:

\[ x = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To calculate the total kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Michael rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Michael decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to find the weight of each candied apple. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40 grams:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams}
\]

Joe also has 80 candied apples, each weighing 20 grams:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}
\]

Finally, we add the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
2600

"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we will calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that on Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

Next, on Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Then, on Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, so the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:

- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:

- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after her initial $10 savings.

Let's denote the number of times Sara mows the lawn as \( x \). The total money she earns from mowing the lawn is $4 * x. Adding her initial savings of $10, the total money she has before buying the jacket and shoes is $10 + $4 * x.

To find out how many times she must mow the lawn, we set up the equation:

\[ 10 + 4x = 70 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 60 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, we know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ 250 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

This result is not physically meaningful because the amount of water cannot be negative. Let's recheck the equations and the logic. The correct interpretation should be:

\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]

Substituting \( B = 4S \) into the second equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work, I will first determine the total cost of her purchase and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is:
\[ \$320.00 + \$32.00 = \$352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{\$352.00}{\$8.00 \text{ per hour}} = 44 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over the 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of the 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, we can calculate the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old} \]

Harriet is half the age of Zack:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we calculate the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years:
\[ \text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66 \]
\[ \text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \]
\[ \text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45 \]

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by three:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Now, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   \text{Jojo's score} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{54}

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"Initially, the tank contains 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, leaving:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

She then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers he plants is 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers. 

\[
\text{Total flowers planted} = 140
\]"
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we first need to calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.

The amount spent on advertising in the first year is $15000. The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the first year's expenditure, which is:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Now, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total expenditure:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Thus, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for, and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos: $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji: $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost: $90 + $90 = $180

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of days Andrew will travel if he goes to Rochester by bus and returns from Rochester by car.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total number of days he will travel is the sum of the days for the one-way trip by bus and the one-way trip by car:

\[
6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card after the changes in James's collection.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

The total number of cards after these changes is:
30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82 cards

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{82} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{82} \right) \times 100 \approx 39.21875 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 39\% \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 39 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we will add up all the individual components and then subtract the gift card value.

The base burrito costs $6.50.
Extra meat costs $2.00.
Extra cheese costs $1.00.
Avocado costs $1.00.
Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00.

Chad then adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink, so we add that to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces on the puzzle.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces.

To find the time in minutes, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Watermelons**: The farm initially produced 120 watermelons.

2. **First Harvest**:
   - 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \).
   - Number of watermelons not ready for harvest: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \).

3. **Second Harvest**:
   - Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \).
   - Number of watermelons not ready for harvest: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \).

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To determine the total amount Mark pays for the fleet of 12 cars, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

First, calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:
\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000 \]

Next, calculate the tax on the cars:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000 \]

Now, add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:
\[ \$240,000 + \$24,000 = \$264,000 \]

Then, calculate the total registration cost for all 12 cars:
\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$1,000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000 \]

Finally, add the registration cost to the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:
\[ \$264,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000 \]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday, Kylie collects \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Thus, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

One-third of the 36 penguins jump into the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

Another one-third go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

Now, we subtract the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he consumes per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, so she eats:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{2} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, they eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new ones. Ram starts with 25 pens and can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. 

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. After this, he will have 24 pens left (25 - 1 = 24).
3. **Second Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more empty pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 23 pens left (24 - 1 = 23).
4. **Continuing the Process**: He continues this process until he no longer has enough empty pens to make a new one.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we need to determine how many times he can use 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This is equivalent to dividing the number of empty pens he has by 5.

Let's calculate the number of new pens he can make:

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine the ages of each individual.

Given:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.

First, calculate Joan's age:
\[
\text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, calculate Mary's age:
\[
\text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Now, sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
\text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68
\]

The sum of the ages of the three girls is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of students**: 1000.

2. **Students exiting through exit A**: 30% of 1000 students.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

3. **Remaining students after exit A**: 
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

4. **Students exiting through exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students exited through exit B.

5. **Remaining students after exit B**: 
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

6. **Students exiting through exit C**: The rest of the students.
   \[
   280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, Robert has:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has two books and reads them, as well as the one book that Pandora has. Therefore, Dolly reads a total of 3 books. Pandora reads her own book and the two books that Dolly has, which totals to 3 books as well. 

Thus, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is 3 + 3 = 6 books. 

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike was originally penpals with 5 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them, so he is now penpals with 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pages a week. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all 3 people is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) pages a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 30 pages a week. So, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(30 + 30 = 60\) pages.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 60 pages, he spends \(60 \times 6 = 360\) minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of hours he spends writing a week is \(\frac{360}{60} = 6\) hours.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly plan allowance.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used in a month. He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Given that there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes used for his calls to his boss is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes with other people. Therefore, the total number of minutes Jason has used in the month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total number of minutes he has used from the total number of minutes allowed by his plan:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now had \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now had \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

The number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write the equation as:

\[ 32 - 4 = 2F \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 2F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ F = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 14."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of hours the makeup artist worked. She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. The movie lasts 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

Total cost before discount = Total hours worked * $250/hour

Finally, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount * (1 - 0.10)

Let's calculate these step by step:

1. Total hours worked = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours
2. Total cost before discount = 120 * $250 = $30,000
3. Total cost after discount = $30,000 * (1 - 0.10) = $30,000 * 0.90 = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split the total cost evenly among her three parents, so we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Therefore, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To calculate the total cost, we first need to find the total weight of the onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Given that a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50 \text{ per pound} = \$300 \]

Thus, the chef spent $300."
"To solve this, let's first determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)

Her sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Each cookie has 200 calories, so we can calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Her sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

The difference in calories consumed is:

\(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the third class. Let's break down the information given:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has 5 boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has 8 boys.

First, let's calculate the total number of boys and girls in the school:

- Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).
- Therefore, the total number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
- Similarly, the total number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

Since each class has 20 students, and the third class has 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( W_1 \) be the number of wolves killed last night.
- Let \( C_1 \) be the number of cougars killed last night.
- Let \( W_2 \) be the number of wolves killed today.
- Let \( C_2 \) be the number of cougars killed today.

From the problem, we know:
- \( W_1 = 10 \)
- \( C_1 = 15 \)
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \( W_2 = 3C_2 \)
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night: \( C_2 = C_1 - 3 \)

First, calculate \( C_2 \):
\[ C_2 = C_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Next, calculate \( W_2 \):
\[ W_2 = 3C_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( W_1 = 10 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( W_2 = 36 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( C_1 = 15 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( C_2 = 12 \)

Total number of wolves killed:
\[ W_1 + W_2 = 10 + 36 = 46 \]

Total number of cougars killed:
\[ C_1 + C_2 = 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Total number of animals killed:
\[ 46 + 27 = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals killed by Rick is:
\[ \boxed{73} \]"

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he now has is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will receive:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to sum the value of each type of coin and bill.

- Pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00
- Nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00
- Dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.00
- Dollar bills: 40 pieces * $1.00/piece = $40.00

Adding these values together:

$1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book overdue for more than a week.

First, we calculate the cost for the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. Therefore, the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book overdue for more than a week, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can determine the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from Andrea's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to the number of apples Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which we can verify by checking:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]

Adding these together:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits is:

\[ 168 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cookies Carla is making over the two days. 

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. We need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies.

First, we calculate the number of dozens in 66 cookies:
\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

Since 5.5 dozens of cookies require 5.5 times the amount of flour needed for one dozen cookies, we multiply the flour needed for one dozen by 5.5:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} \times 5.5 = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need:
\[ 11 \text{ cups of flour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6,200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."

   \]
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Therefore, Harry has:
   \[
   2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:
\[

"First, let's determine the amount of money each girl has:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find the total amount of money all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

- Total = Carmen's amount + Samantha's amount + Daisy's amount
- Total = $100 + $125 + $175

Let's calculate the total:

- Total = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

First, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500 \]

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000 \]

Now, let's find the total price of the house including both fees:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500 \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

First, calculate the transfer fees:
Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

Next, calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

Now, add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total expenses:
Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses = $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, but this is not an expense in the context of calculating net proceeds from the sale. Therefore, it does not affect the net proceeds from the sale.

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $368,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. The oil takes 20 minutes to heat to 300 degrees. It then takes 40% longer to heat to 400 degrees. 

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ \boxed{71} \]"

\[ 300 + 12 = 312 \]

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is:
\[ 762 \]"
"To determine the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we consider the additional windows:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since John has 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Thus, the total number of windows in both houses is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the collar and rosette from the total gives the number of stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

6. **Stitches for each sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
765

"To calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = \$800 \]

The cost of the celery seeds is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of celery seeds} = 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = \$2400 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used \$3200 to buy the seeds."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   Adding the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene, we get:
   \[
   54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \text{ lines}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
\[
\boxed{138}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D on them, are:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 9 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time required for each type of hole.

For small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Next, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. 

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each:

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each:

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of spots for both cobras and mambas, and then find half of that total.

First, let's determine the number of spots for a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots for a mamba as follows:
\[ \text{Number of spots for a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:
\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:
\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots for the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total:
\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total number of spots:
\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests.

The total number of people is:
12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people.

Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza:
13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is one inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the length available for the sterling silver beads is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length available for the beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up the totals for all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Thus, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract this from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. We can break this down into the following rows:
- Three rows of 8 stars each.
- Two rows of 6 stars each.
- The rest are 5-star rows.

First, we calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

Next, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Since each of these 5-star rows contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining number of stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:
\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula for time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the number of medals each person has:

- Ali has 22 medals.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

Together, Ali and Izzy have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This can be interpreted as the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is \(10 \times 39 = 390\).

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \).

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The number of chocolate bars for the adults is 24.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left for the children is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \).

Finally, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 8 children.
- Therefore, each child will get \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \) chocolate bars.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, we subtract this from the total time:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time into minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by $5:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is:

\[ 75 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we first need to calculate the points each player has after the initial 3 rounds.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players need extra points in the fourth round. Since Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, he does not get an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is also not over 20, so he does not get an extra point either. Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

After the extra point is distributed, the points are:
- Mike: \(21 + 0 = 21\) points
- Jim: \(18 + 0 = 18\) points
- Tony: \(42 + 1 = 43\) points

The total points after the extra points are distributed is:
\[21 + 18 + 43 = 82\]

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

First, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members of the household:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 5 \, \text{members} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the 5 members:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold on these days:
\[
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Carmen's total expenditure is the sum of her bids:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \]
\[ 350 + 400 = 750 \]
\[ 500 + 750 = 1250 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carmen spends on the antique desk is:
\[ \boxed{1250} \]"
"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost is $2 per mile, so the cost for 15,000 miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, we calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 50 weeks in a year, which is approximately 13.33 months (50 weeks / 4 weeks/month ≈ 12.5 months, but we'll use 13.33 for precision).
- The total bonus is $150/month * 13.33 months/year ≈ $1,999.50.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year:
- Total cost = $30,000 + $1,999.50 = $31,999.50.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31999.50}

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each side of the fold. Therefore, each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can be used to print 2 pages.
2. For 32 pages, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages that can be printed on one piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{2} = 16
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 16."

"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider his daily wage, the number of days he works in a week, and the number of weeks in April. We also need to account for the weekly bonus he receives when the company performs well.

First, let's determine the number of days Watson works in April. April has 30 days, and he works 5 days a week. Therefore, the number of weeks in April is 30 days / 5 days/week = 6 weeks. 

Next, we calculate his earnings from his hourly wage. He works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. Therefore, his daily earnings are 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day. Over 5 days, his weekly earnings are $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week. Since he works for 6 weeks in April, his total earnings from his hourly wage are $500/week * 6 weeks = $3000.

Additionally, since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Over 6 weeks, his total bonus is $300/week * 6 weeks = $1800.

Adding his total earnings from his hourly wage and his total bonus, we get $3000 + $1800 = $4800.

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April if the company performed very well for the whole month is $4800."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we calculate:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total loaves produced daily**: 60 loaves.

2. **Morning sales**: Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   \[
   \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves left after morning sales**: Subtract the morning sales from the total.
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and evening sales**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Half of the remaining loaves} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in a single week is:

\[ \text{Weight lost by Joey per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in a week, Sandy will need:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 1 \text{ week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the savings from the discounts on the ice cream and milk.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Thus, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow over this period.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms. The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every three days. We need to find out how many times three days fit into fifteen days:

\[
\frac{15}{3} = 5
\]

So, the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs. The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every five days. We need to find out how many times five days fit into fifteen days:

\[
\frac{15}{5} = 3
\]

So, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs together:

\[
5 + 3 = 8
\]

Therefore, the total number of new limbs that Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- Total cost for business suits = 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- Total cost for suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- Cost of a business suit = $100.
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
- Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
- Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend and wishes to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip is:
- Amount to spend = Total money - Savings
- Amount to spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Finally, let's calculate the amount he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners:
- Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total cost of items
- Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The final numerical answer is $2050."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption of eggs and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

In the family:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- The three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The two people who eat 2 eggs each day consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- The weekly consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Thus, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age, and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, calculate Jane's age:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, calculate Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Calculate Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed since then, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let \(P\) be the current population of Chile.
   - Six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

4. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20 years, so the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 60000\)

6. **Solve for \(P\):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to find \(P\):
     \[
     P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
     \]

Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for those who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for those who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store is:
\[ 20 + 50 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

First, we multiply the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Then we multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Performing the multiplication:

\[ C = 12 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \), the number of girls as \( G \), and the number of nongendered children as \( N \).

Given:
- \( B = 30 \)
- The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys: \( G = 3B \)
- The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys: \( N = \frac{1}{10}B \)

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ G = 3B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10}B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and knowing that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can find the number of electric poles by setting up a proportion.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:

\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can cross-multiply:

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15."
"At the beginning, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 1/4 of 40 people left, or 10 people. If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men out of the 10 who left must be the ones who left, since 22 men plus the 10 who left equals the original 32 men who were there at the beginning.

Since 10 people left in total, and 22 men stayed, this implies that 12 women also stayed (since 22 men + 12 women = 32 people who stayed). Therefore, the number of women who left is 15 - 12 = 3 women.

The final numerical answer is 12 women are left at the party."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Adding the 46 pencils that Meg has, we get the total number of pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, we need to consider that each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effect of the cooling and the added liquid separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much weaker the total volume is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded is equivalent to 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total monthly payment to all programmers at the company. We know the following:

1. The total number of employees is 100.
2. The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
3. The number of senior programmers is the remaining part of the total number of employees.
4. Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
5. Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.

First, we calculate the number of junior programmers:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, we calculate the number of senior programmers:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

We know each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to the junior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer, so:
\[
\text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

The total monthly payment to the senior programmers is:
\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, we add the total payments to both junior and senior programmers to find the total monthly payment to all programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are told that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

\(\boxed{14}\)"
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. He then passes out 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. He then buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the remaining lollipops, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, which is a total of 3 + 2 = 5 lollipops. Therefore, Oscar has 36 - 5 = 31 lollipops.

"The phone is currently at 60% charge and needs to reach 100% charge. The recharging rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. 

To find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone, we subtract the current charge from 100%:
100% - 60% = 40% needed to be charged.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:
40% * 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes to fully charge the phone.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:
120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the $8 rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards.
   - Since the rewards used were $8, the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - After applying the $16 coupon, the cost becomes $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before property tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Net income tax rate: 10%
- Net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay rates:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."

"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we will first determine the amount of sugar required for the suckers and then for the fudge, and finally sum these amounts.

For the suckers:
- 1 batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, 8 batches of suckers will require \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

For the fudge:
- 1 batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, 1 batch of fudge will require 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar required = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar required = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is 310 ounces."

   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after increase} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value of Shares at the End of the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Value at the end of the first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

4. **Second Year Price Decrease:**
   The stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after decrease} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9
   \]

5. **Value of Shares at the End of the Second Year:**
   \[
   \text{Value at the end of the second year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72
   \]

Thus, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs. To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

The final numerical answer is 1."
"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:

\[ \text{Total number of legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). Therefore, the total number of balls he would have is 3 (initial) + 4 (added) = 7 balls. However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls, 2 of which are caught by people in the crowd and 1 is lost. Thus, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is 7 - 3 = 4 balls."
"Given the weights of the animals in relation to the pink frog, we can establish the following weights:

- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 50 pounds - 20 pounds = 30 pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. The container weighs 20 pounds.

The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird, and the container:

\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 \]

Let's add these weights step by step:

\[ 50 + 50 = 100 \]
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
\[ 150 + 60 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 30 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:

\[ 260 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 260 \]"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits Laurel has, we need to add up all the outfits she received.

First, we know that Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

Next, Laurel received twice the amount of outfits her friend gave her at her baby shower. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, we sum all the outfits together:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 \]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

Thus, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is:
\[ \boxed{87} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month, given that he increases his daily distance by 1/5 of his original distance.

First, let's determine the new daily distance Tyson runs:
- Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters.
- The increase in distance is 1/5 of 5000 meters, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- Therefore, the new daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. June has 30 days.

The total distance Tyson runs in June is:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

- The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to consider the number of legs on each type of table and the quantity of each type.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Thus, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in a week.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies her son takes:
- She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies her son takes in a week is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

Next, let's calculate the number of cookies her husband eats:
- Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies her husband eats in a week is \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies.

Now, let's find the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband:
- Total cookies consumed by her son and her husband = \(20 + 7 = 27\) cookies.

Since Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week and each bag contains 36 cookies, the total number of cookies in a week is 36. Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
- Total cookies - Cookies consumed by her son and her husband = \(36 - 27 = 9\) cookies.

Thus, the number of cookies Jenny eats is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To calculate the total cost Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to determine the discount amount per shirt and then the total cost.

The original price of each shirt is $30. With a 40% discount, the discount amount per shirt is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{40}{100} = 30 \times 0.40 = 12 \]

So, the price per shirt after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, the total cost for the 2 shirts is:
\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory makes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from silos.
3. Find the difference between the earnings from silos and tractors.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the earnings from tractors.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

Now, let's find the difference in daily earnings:
- The difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

Finally, let's calculate the percentage increase:
- The percentage increase = (Difference / Original Amount) * 100
- The original amount (daily earnings from tractors) = $1000/day.
- Therefore, the percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The percentage more they are making per day now is 10%."
"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding the costs of food, treats, and medicine gives us the total monthly cost.
   - Total monthly cost = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12.
   - Annual cost = $120 \times 12 = $1440.

Therefore, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"To determine the total number of hours for all of Peyton's after-work activities, we will calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga class.
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class.
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating: 6 hours
Swimming: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.

Total time spent on boating and swimming: \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) hours.

We are told that this 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's denote the total time spent on all activities as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the earnings from both jobs to find the total amount of money Annabelle will have after working at both jobs:

\[ 200 + 75 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

Annabelle already has $80 in her savings. Adding the money she will earn from her jobs to her current savings gives:

\[ 80 + 275 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the shortest and second trees combined. First, we calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second trees} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toys Dean bought:

- Dean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2, so the total cost for the toy cars is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- Dean bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1, so the total cost for the teddy bears is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the toys is \(12 + 5 = 17\) dollars.

Dean initially had $28, and after buying the toys, he has \(28 - 17 = 11\) dollars left.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so Dean now has \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is $21."
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to subtract the costs of the activities she wants to do from her total budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the activities she wants to do:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10, so the total cost for the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
- She also wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.

Adding these costs together:
\[ 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget is $90. Subtracting the cost of the activities from her budget gives:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

This $60 is the amount of money left for the friends. Since each friend will get a round of mini-golf and $5 in arcade tokens, we need to determine how many friends can be accommodated with the remaining $60.

A round of mini-golf costs $5, so with $60, she can afford:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]
rounds of mini-golf.

Since each friend gets one round of mini-golf, she can invite 12 friends.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply by 5.

First, let's calculate her daily expenditure on lollipops:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
- She buys 4 lollipops each day.

Daily expenditure on lollipops:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to convert the daily expenditure from cents to dollars:
\[ 100 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Now, let's calculate her daily savings:
- Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.
- She spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Daily savings:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her total savings over 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

The total amount spent on gumballs is $2. Therefore, the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

The final numerical answer is 5.3333 pounds."
"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \).

Given:
\[ C = 45 \]
\[ C = 2S - 5 \]

We can substitute the value of \( C \) into the second equation:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old."
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[ \frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80} \]

This fraction represents the fraction of a day the train travels before needing service. To find the number of days between services, we take the reciprocal of this fraction:
\[ \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \]

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per chihuahua bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per collie bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, let's calculate the time taken for John's trip to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we consider the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time taken for John's return trip. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add the times for both parts of the trip to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} + 6 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the trip is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Let's express this as a decimal for clarity:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on her third test. We set up the inequality to find the minimum \( x \):

\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:

\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9. 

\[
\boxed{9}

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is:
\[ 4x - 5 \]
Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers for shoplifting. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we first need to establish the points Erin has after scoring 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's points now} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Erin scored 14 points after reaching 24 points. Therefore, the points Erin had before scoring the 14 points are:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's points now} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198."
"To determine the total cost of making one's own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY process and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY process saves 20% of this cost. To find the savings, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ \text{Savings} = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

Subtracting the savings from the original cost gives us the total cost for making the wallpaper:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Thus, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday Sales**: The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}

"To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday.
   - She sold these apples at $4 per piece.
   - She earned $56 from selling these apples.
   - Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total earnings on Monday}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Number of apples picked on Tuesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment for a loan with a principal of $3,650, a term of five months, and an annual interest rate of 10%.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the loan. The formula for the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \text{Time in Years} \]

Given:
- Principal = $3,650
- Annual Interest Rate = 10% = 0.10
- Time in Years = 5 months = 5/12 years

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 152.5875 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the total interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.5875 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.5875 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.5875}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.5175 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.52 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.52 per month."

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. Since she can make 3 pitchers of lemonade and each pitcher holds 12 cups, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is given as $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$4.50 \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{4.50} \]"
"Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he retained \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he retained is given as 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26. On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

This means that the number of female members who do make it to the show is:

\[
26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets, we need to calculate the cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Therefore, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha would need 9 rides * $4 per ride = $36.

Now, we compare the total costs:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
- Savings = Dasha's cost - David's cost

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services he will be using.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% savings for bundling:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month.
- The savings for bundling is 20%, so the savings for each service is 20% of $10, which is $2.
- Therefore, the cost of Hulu after the savings is $10 - $2 = $8.
- Similarly, the cost of Disney Plus after the savings is $10 - $2 = $8.

Now, let's add the costs of the streaming services:
- The cost of Netflix is $10.
- The cost of Hulu is $8.
- The cost of Disney Plus is $8.

The total cost of the streaming services is:
\[ 10 + 8 + 8 = 26 \]

Tim's cable package costs $60, so the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- Time spent recording it: half of the time spent writing it = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing it: 90 minutes

Next, we'll calculate the total time spent on all activities:

- Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
- Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Now, we'll find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:

- Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
- Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To find out how many bags are needed for 12 cups of flour:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \]

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To find out how many bottles are needed for 4 cups of milk:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \]

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \]

Thus, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under two different conditions: the original usage and the reduced usage. Then, we can find the difference in energy consumption over a period of 30 days.

First, let's determine the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original usage conditions:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts of power.
- It is used for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
  \[
  900 \text{ watts} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours}
  \]
- To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
  \[
  7200 \text{ watt-hours} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
  \]

Next, let's determine the energy consumption under the reduced usage conditions:
- The air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).
- Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
  \[
  900 \text{ watts} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours}
  \]
- Converting to kilowatt-hours:
  \[
  2700 \text{ watt-hours} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
  \]

Now, we calculate the energy saved per day:
\[
7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours} - 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours} = 4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
\]

Finally, we find the total energy saved over 30 days:
\[
4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
\]

Thus, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[
\boxed{135}

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each, so \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes.

Adding these together, the total number of stripes is:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\frac{88}{3} = 29.3333\ldots\]

Rounded to two decimal places, the average number of stripes is \(29.33\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[29.33\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total expenditure:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, and there is twice as much corn as cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

Initial number of corns = 2 * Initial number of cannolis
Initial number of corns = 2 * 40
Initial number of corns = 80

Allan then bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

New total number of cannolis = Initial number of cannolis + Additional cannolis
New total number of cannolis = 40 + 60
New total number of cannolis = 100

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:

New number of corns = New total number of cannolis - 40
New number of corns = 100 - 40
New number of corns = 60

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new number of corns and the new total number of cannolis:

Combined total = New number of corns + New total number of cannolis
Combined total = 60 + 100
Combined total = 160

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps so far. He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had left after his jog from the total steps he aimed to take:

\[ 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \]

Therefore, Elliott took 8,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby starts reading 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he will be:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ minutes early} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[
     6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} - 10 \text{ employees} = 30 \text{ employees}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}

Thus, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3/2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets.

So, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10 she was given.

Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. The discount amount is:

\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \]

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Therefore, the total amount Tim spends is:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Thus, the total amount Tim spends is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

Given:
- Total candles made: 50,000
- Percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode: 99%
- Percentage of dangerous candles that have a defect (smell like wet dog): 5%

First, calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Next, calculate the number of dangerous candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog):
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 2,500 \times 0.05 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

"First, let's determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$20 = 0.30 \times 20 = \$6 \]

Subtracting the discount from the regular price gives the discounted price:
\[ \$20 - \$6 = \$14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ 4 \times \$14 = \$56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \$56 \]

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathered \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister gathered three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

Therefore, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \( 350 \)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

We know that:
1. Each camel and each dromedary has one head, so the total number of heads is \( c + d = 180 \).
2. Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, so the total number of humps is \( 2c + d = 304 \).

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now, substituting \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we will break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the fifth day, Tom did not travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

For the sixth day, Tom traveled 300 kilometers:
\[ 300 \text{ km} \]

For the seventh day, Tom traveled 300 kilometers:
\[ 300 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} = 1640 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker size is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker size is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"The second bank gave Mr. Josue twice the amount of the first bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000. Adding the capital he initially had to the amounts given by the banks, we get $5000 + $4000 + $8000 = $17000. Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats. Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the pricing changes.

First, we calculate the cost for the first 6 months:
- The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost for the next 2 months is $12 per month.
- Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

Now, we calculate the cost for the remaining 8 months (months 9 through 16):
- The cost for the remaining 8 months is $14 per month.
- Total cost for the remaining 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

Finally, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $112 (remaining 8 months) = $184.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $184."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine the amount saved from each type of jeans. Let's denote the amount saved from the jogger jeans as \( x \) and the amount saved from the tattered jeans as \( y \). We know that:

\[ x + y = 6 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

Since the amount saved from the tattered jeans cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the distribution. The correct distribution should be:

\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

This indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the distribution:

\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct distribution should be:

\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct interpretation is:

\[ x = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \text{Jogger jeans originally cost } \$22 \text{ and the tattered jeans cost } \$28. \]

The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

Therefore, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 180 birds. 

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards, as he keeps \( \frac{1}{3}x \) cards. He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

We know that after selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash. Therefore, the amount of money he gets from selling the cards is $50 + $100 (the cost of the ticket) = $150.

So, we have the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \( 150 \) cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hotdogs prepared. The caterer was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since 40 guests showed up, half of the guests would be 20. Therefore, 20 guests would each have 2 hotdogs, which totals to:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, we need to see if there were enough hotdogs for everyone to have a second one. Since there were only 40 hotdogs prepared, and 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, 20 guests will not get a second hotdog.

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
\boxed{20}

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, which totals to $25.00

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find the discounted price, we calculate 80% of $165.00:

\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Charlotte has to pay for her order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]

2. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
     \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then use that information to find out how many candy bars he bought.

First, let's calculate how much money George had initially. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, it means he spent 99% of his money. Let's denote the initial amount of money George had as \( x \). Therefore, 99% of \( x \) is $5:

\[ 0.99x = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{5}{0.99} \approx 5.0505 \]

Now, we know George spent $5 on chips and candy bars. Let's denote the number of candy bars George bought as \( y \). The cost of chips is 40 cents and the cost of candy bars is 75 cents. Therefore, the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ 0.40 \times 3 + 0.75 \times y = 5 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 1.20 + 0.75y = 5 \]

Subtract 1.20 from both sides:

\[ 0.75y = 3.80 \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since the number of candy bars must be a whole number, and considering the context of the problem, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5. Let's verify:

If George bought 5 candy bars, the cost would be:

\[ 0.75 \times 5 = 3.75 \]

Adding the cost of the chips:

\[ 1.20 + 3.75 = 4.95 \]

This is less than $5, so let's check if he could have bought 4 candy bars:

If George bought 4 candy bars, the cost would be:

\[ 0.75 \times 4 = 3.00 \]

Adding the cost of the chips:

\[ 1.20 + 3.00 = 4.20 \]

This is also less than $5, so let's check if he could have bought 3 candy bars:

If George bought 3 candy bars, the cost would be:

\[ 0.75 \times 3 = 2.25 \]

Adding the cost of the chips:

\[ 1.20 + 2.25 = 3.45 \]

This is still less than $5, so let's check if he could have bought 2 candy bars:

If George bought 2 candy bars, the cost would be:

\[ 0.75 \times 2 = 1.50 \]

Adding the cost of the chips:

\[ 1.20 + 1.50 = 2.70 \]

This is still less than $5, so let's check if he could have bought 1 candy bar:

If George bought 1 candy bar, the cost would be:

\[ 0.75 \times 1 = 0.75 \]

Adding the cost of the chips:

\[ 1.20 + 0.75 = 1.95 \]

This is still less than $5, so let's check if he could have bought 0 candy bars:

If George bought 0 candy bars, the cost would be:

\[ 1.20 \]

Adding the cost of the chips:

\[ 1.20 + 1.20 = 2.40 \]

This is still less than $5, so the only way to reach exactly $5 is if he bought 5 candy bars. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops among his four friends. Each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This makes a total of 8 people (2 + 6 = 8).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

Oranges per person = 56 / 8 = 7.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time to arrive at the same time as Wayne.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width as follows:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Let's calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours in the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   \[
   \text{Temperature increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature after baking} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open.
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature decrease} = 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final temperature} = 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time for the run for James. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James took 10 minutes more than Jon to complete the triathlon. Therefore, the total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs:

- The number of glasses that can be made is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Finally, since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we can calculate the number of trays that can be filled:

- The number of trays that can be filled is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

2 trays"

"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sneakers sold and then subtract the cost of the sneakers.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday:
- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each.
- Revenue from the flash sale = 17 * $20 = $340.

Next, we calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:
- Total sneakers = 48
- Sneakers sold to the department store = 48 - 17 = 31.

Now, we calculate the revenue from the department store:
- The department store bought the sneakers for $25 each.
- Revenue from the department store = 31 * $25 = $775.

Next, we calculate the total revenue:
- Total revenue = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
- Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Cost of the sneakers = $576.
- Profit = Total revenue - Cost of the sneakers
- Profit = $1115 - $576 = $539.

Thus, the salesman's profit is $539."

For the first type of packets:
- Number of packets: 6
- Pieces per packet: 8
- Total pieces from these packets: \(6 \times 8 = 48\)

For the second type of packets:
- Number of packets: 4
- Pieces per packet: 16
- Total pieces from these packets: \(4 \times 16 = 64\)

Now, we add the totals from both types of packets:
- Total pieces of crayons: \(48 + 64 = 112\)

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 pieces of crayons."
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. Therefore, the total cost of the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This can be expressed as:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the original cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20 \text{ balloons}} = \$45 \text{ per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \text{ per balloon} \]

Now, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \text{ balloons} \times \$65 \text{ per balloon} = \$11050 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$11050 \]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

After trading, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8). The value of these 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the total value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ \$4000 \text{ (value of sapphires)} + \$2400 \text{ (value of rubies)} = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[
\boxed{6400}

"To determine the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples eaten by Marin in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples eaten by Nancy in 30 days.
3. Add the two quantities together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required to fill all the raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil required is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[
\boxed{1920}

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. 

First, calculate 60% of the number of red cards:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 15 = 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Thus, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:
\[ 78 \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \). Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 35 \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number:
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Since 2250 pounds is exactly half of 4500 pounds, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

Weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

Weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Determine how many plants Shondra has based on Toni's number of plants.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10 plants.

To find 60% of Frederick's plants:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost of Razors:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Discount:**
   - The discount is ""buy one get one free.""
   - This means for every 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.

3. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon to the $4.00 cost of 1 pack, the cost becomes:
     \[
     4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost in Cents:**
   - The total cost in dollars is $2.00.
   - To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2.00 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, 2 packs contain:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

6. **Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - The total cost is 200 cents for 8 razors.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of cheerleaders in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of each cheerleader is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[
\boxed{53}

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the current ages of Brett and Angela.

Brett is currently 14 years old.

In four years, Brett's age will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Angela's current age:
\[ \text{Angela's age in 4 years} = 3 \times 14 \]

Let's calculate the right side of the equation:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 years from 42:
\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during the two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides Paul took in a single day. He drives twice a day, so that's 2 rides per day.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides he took over the 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of these rides. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. Since he drives twice a day, half of the rides are morning rides and the other half are afternoon rides:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ rides}}{2} = 14 \text{ morning rides} \]
\[ \frac{28 \text{ rides}}{2} = 14 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 14 \text{ morning rides} \times \$6/\text{ride} = \$84 \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 14 \text{ afternoon rides} \times \$2/\text{ride} = \$28 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for the 14 days:
\[ \$84 + \$28 = \$112 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne.

Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they brought together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the costs of the two venues are equal, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per guest is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and then add the additional gifts she decided to buy.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her 5 friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts for her friends is:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decided to buy 10 more random gifts. Therefore, the total number of gifts she bought is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Therefore, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. 

The final numerical answer is 18."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Since she bought four packs of gum in total, and two of them were strawberry, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. And she bought a small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of using 2 x 4 pieces of wood versus 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 4 = $4
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 4 = 200
  - Cost per stick = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 8 = 400
  - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should use as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible within his budget of $24.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
- Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
- Total budget = $24
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make:
- Number of sticks = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of legs (since each pair of snowshoes is for one pair of legs).
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of legs.

First, we know that Mario has 6 sled dogs and each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers one pair of legs, the number of pairs of legs (and thus the number of pairs of snowshoes) is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total weekly expenditure on bus trips.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, her total number of bus trips per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so her total weekly expenditure on bus trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20. To find out how much she would save by buying the bus pass, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from her total weekly expenditure on bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, and the zoo has 20 sheep). The zoo has 20 cows and 40 sheep (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, and the farm has 30 cows).

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm is 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals.
The total number of animals in the zoo is 20 cows + 40 sheep = 60 animals.

The combined total number of animals on the farm and the zoo is 45 + 60 = 105 animals."
"To determine the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \):
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We count the days:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
- July has 19 days, so from July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:

\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

To find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} = 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of 553 calories to reach his goal. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 553 \]"

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance in kilometers is:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 kilometers, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Thus, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:

\[ 120 \text{ ml} \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will follow the steps outlined:

1. Julie initially had $500.
2. She spent 20% of it on clothes. The amount spent on clothes is 20% of $500, which is \( 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \) dollars.
3. After spending $100 on clothes, the remaining amount is \( 500 - 100 = 400 \) dollars.
4. Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. The amount spent on CDs is 25% of $400, which is \( 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
5. After spending $100 on CDs, the remaining amount is \( 400 - 100 = 300 \) dollars.

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her canvas bags is $288."
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total duration of the fight:**
   - A fight lasts 5 rounds.
   - Each round lasts 3 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total duration of the fight is \( 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of punches thrown:**
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Over a 15-minute fight, the total number of punches thrown is \( 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \).

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."
"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies that Josh made. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

The total amount of money from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount of money from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of each item she needs to knit for her 3 grandchildren, and then multiply by the number of skeins required for each item.

For each grandchild:
- Hats: 3 hats
- Scarves: 3 scarves
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters
- Mittens: 3 pairs of mittens
- Socks: 3 pairs of socks

Now, we calculate the total number of each item for 3 grandchildren:
- Total hats: 3 hats * 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Total scarves: 3 scarves * 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
- Total sweaters: 3 sweaters * 12 skeins per sweater = 36 skeins
- Total mittens: 3 pairs of mittens * 1 skein per pair = 3 skeins
- Total socks: 3 pairs of socks * 2 skeins per pair = 6 skeins

Finally, we sum up the total number of skeins needed:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the quarts picked per hour by Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy:

\[
6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device.

First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour.

Next, let's calculate her daily consumption after adding the new device:
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the weekly consumption for both scenarios:
- Weekly consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours.
- Weekly consumption after adding the new device: 14 kilowatt-hours * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours.

Next, we calculate the cost for both scenarios:
- Cost before adding the new device: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $126.
- Cost after adding the new device: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $147.

Finally, we find the difference between the two costs:
- Difference in weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints a house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is one-fourth of a house. Therefore, the rate of one person is 1/4 of a house per day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. Thus, 5 people can paint 5/4 of a house in one day.

To paint a whole house, 5 people would need to paint 4/4 of a house, which is the same as 1 house. Since they can paint 5/4 of a house in one day, it would take them 4/5 of a day to paint a whole house.

To convert this into hours, we note that one day is 24 hours. Therefore, 4/5 of a day is:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house."

Given:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which means \( C_O = 22 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \).
- Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \).

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{172}

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the headphone set.
2. Subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount Tom paid to find out how much he spent on CDs.
3. Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the amount he spent on CDs.

First, we know that Tom paid a total of $48 and the headphone set cost $4. Therefore, the amount spent on CDs is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we know that each CD costs $4. To find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with $44, we divide $44 by the cost of one CD:
\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

Therefore, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week. We know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. For the remaining 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week and for 1 week he worked out for 6 hours.

Let's calculate the total:

For the 6 weeks where he worked out for 4 hours each week:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

For the 2 weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

For the 1 week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total number of hours:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times as many as those who got off, which is \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(70 - 21 + 63 = 112\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 112."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Since Jame will be 31 in 8 years (27 + 5), twice his age will be:

\[ 2 \times 31 = 62 \]

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years less than 62, which is:

\[ 62 - 5 = 57 \]

This means that Jame's cousin is currently:

\[ 57 - 8 = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is 22 years old and his cousin is 49 years old, so the difference in their ages is:

\[ 49 - 22 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of years separating the age of Jame and his cousin is:

\[ 27 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- \( C = 1100 \)
- \( P = C - 400 \)
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = C - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we know the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are twenty kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are ten boys and ten girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are ten girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies. Therefore, the final numerical answer is 16."

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we will calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

The total number of vlogs she has made so far is:
18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

Therefore, the number of vlogs she still needs to make is:
72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs already made) = 18 vlogs.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To solve this, first calculate the tip on the $50 dinner bill. The tip is 20% of $50, which is:

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount to be paid, including the tip, is:

\[ \text{Total} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, I ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the initial share of each boy. The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy's initial share is:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

The eldest boy's initial share is $6. He then adds $5 to his share, making it:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

The following day, he adds another $10 to his share, making it:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

He then spends $8 from his total, so his share becomes:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. Let's denote the amount he had left after spending the $8 as \( x \). So, \( x = 13 \). Tripling this amount gives:
\[ 3 \times 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves in the second half of April, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half, and that his total monthly savings target is $1125.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings in the first and second halves of April:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's total monthly savings target is $1125, so we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Thus, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he saves:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought five oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought six peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $7.00."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so he walks a total of 6 miles per day. If he has to work 5 times a week, then the total number of miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Alphabet Length**: The English alphabet consists of 26 letters.

2. **First Two Full Alphabets**:
   - Elise writes the alphabet twice.
   - Therefore, the number of letters written in the first two full alphabets is:
     \[
     2 \times 26 = 52
     \]

3. **Half of the Alphabet**:
   - Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of letters written in half of the alphabet is:
     \[
     13

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( J \).

First, we need to understand the size of James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set.

Let's denote the number of toys in the sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set as \( 5 \times 80 \). This equals 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ J = 400 - 2 \]
\[ J = 398 \]

Thus, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{398} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item he wants to buy before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. **Cost of notebooks:**
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

2. **Cost of pens:**
   - Each pen costs $0.25.
   - Daniel wants to buy 2 pens.
   - Total cost for pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

3. **Cost of the calculator:**
   - The calculator costs $12.
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 calculator.
   - Total cost for the calculator = $12.

4. **Cost of the geometry set:**
   - The geometry set costs $10.
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 geometry set.
   - Total cost for the geometry set = $10.

Now, we add up the total cost of all items before the discount:
- Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20.

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
- 10% of $20 = 0.10 * $20 = $2.
- Discounted total cost = $20 - $2 = $18.

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items he wants to buy."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water conditions.

1. **Cold Water Condition:**
   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Warm Water Condition:**
   - The time it takes to swim a mile in warm water is 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.
   - Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this, the time in warm water is \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

3. **Time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - Time per mile = 16 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - Time per mile = 34 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water.

5. **Difference in time:**
   - Time in warm water = 102 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia and Juan, and then calculate the difference between Juan's current intake and the recommended intake.

First, let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee:
\[ \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks:
\[ \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan's current intake of 5R cups must be reduced to 4 cups.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his intake, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 5R - 4 \]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, we need to express the reduction in terms of \( R \). However, the problem does not provide the specific value of \( R \), but it asks for the reduction in terms of the given intake and the recommended intake.

Thus, the reduction Juan must make is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives the total number of rodents:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight of the three friends, we sum their weights and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum of their weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved 10 hours upward from the tip of the pyramid.

Initially, the angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved upward by:

\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the ages of James' sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means he is 8 years old.

So, the total number of candles needed is 12 (for the older son) + 8 (for the younger son) = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week by multiplying the reading time in minutes by the number of pages read per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten is \( 4 + 3 = 7 \). The number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the variables and equations based on the information given.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and \( N \) be his nephew's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \), and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, his nephew is currently 10 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy for each tooth she lost.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each, so for three teeth, the total is $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth, which was $1.00. Therefore, for each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 / 2 = $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we first need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as \( M \) and the number of goals scored by Anna as \( A \).

From the information given:
1. \( R = M + 20 \)
2. \( R = A + 45 \)
3. \( R = 80 \)

Using the third equation, we can substitute \( R \) with 80:
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
\[ M = 80 - 20 \]
\[ M = 60 \]

Next, using the second equation:
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
\[ A = 80 - 45 \]
\[ A = 35 \]

Now, we know:
- Mark scored 60 goals.
- Anna scored 35 goals.
- Richie scored 80 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum their individual scores:
\[ \text{Total goals} = M + A + R \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 60 + 35 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To determine how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's earnings.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, Mitchell's total earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Mitchell's earnings} = 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Peter spends each day and then calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys over the week.

First, let's calculate the total amount Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5.

\[
\text{Total cost for wooden action figures} = 4 \text{ days} \times \$5 \text{ per figure} = \$20
\]

Next, we subtract the cost of the wooden action figures from Peter's total money to find out how much he has left for the rest of the week.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = \$70 - \$20 = \$50
\]

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), Peter buys plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2.

\[
\text{Total cost for plastic action figures} = 3 \text{ days} \times \$2 \text{ per figure} = \$6
\]

Subtract the cost of the plastic action figures from the remaining money to find out how much Peter has left after buying the plastic action figures.

\[
\text{Remaining money after plastic action figures} = \$50 - \$6 = \$44
\]

Now, we calculate the number of wooden action figures Peter buys:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{\$20}{\$5 \text{ per figure}} = 4 \text{ figures}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter buys:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{\$44}{\$2 \text{ per figure}} = 22 \text{ figures}
\]

Finally, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter has by the end of the week.

\[
\text{Total number of action figures} = 4 \text{ wooden figures} + 22 \text{ plastic figures} = 26 \text{ figures}
\]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to sum up the costs of each item:

1. Spaying the kitten: $200
2. Vaccines: 3 vaccines at $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Damages to the vases: 4 vases at $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these costs together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (damages) = $308

Therefore, the total cost for Leah so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account over that period and subtract it from her initial balance.

First, we calculate the total amount removed from the account over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months. If Katina removes $100 every month, the total amount removed over 24 months is \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial balance:
\[3000 - 2400 = 600\]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for 10 sandwiches:
- Cost of bread: $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, for 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread, which costs $3.00.
- Cost of cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- Therefore, the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

Thus, the net profit is $37.00."
"First, we need to determine the total number of crayon pieces Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of carpet} = 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of padding} = 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars}

\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

Thus, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is 40."
"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

The next step is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we divide this result by 5:
\[ \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Finally, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
\[ 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is:
\[ 48 \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven's temperature setting and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error for the 450 degrees setting:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Actual Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{468} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{468} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{1}{26} \right) \times 100 \approx 3.846\%
\]

Now, we apply this same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe:

\[
\text{Set Temperature} = \text{Actual Temperature} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Error}}{100}\right)
\]

\[
\text{Set Temperature} = 520 \times \left(1 + \frac{3.846}{100}\right)
\]

\[
\text{Set Temperature} = 520 \times 1.03846

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend. Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes she brought is \(12 + 24 = 36\). Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought is \(40 + 44 = 84\).

Adding the totals together, the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is \(36 + 84 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes.

First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount:
- Original price of one box: $100.00
- Discount: 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
- Discounted price of one box: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
- Total cost for 2 boxes: 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Next, we need to determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes:
- Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
- Total contacts from 2 boxes: 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.
- Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the total number of pairs: 180 / 2 = 90 pairs.

Finally, we calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
- Total cost for 2 boxes: $180.00
- Total number of pairs: 90 pairs
- Cost per pair: $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair.

Thus, the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes is $2.00."
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours worked by Jill is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

On Saturday, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

On Sunday, John worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total hours worked by John is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's earnings:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Given that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:
- For every 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, the amount of water she needs to drink = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \), and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we first need to calculate the total number of words per minute (WPM) he has achieved over the three tests.

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, we sum these three values:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 47 + 52 = 99 \]
\[ 99 + 57 = 156 \]

So, the total number of words per minute over the three tests is 156.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of measurements (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is:

- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it surpasses the 20-foot mark.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

We can see that on Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than the 20-foot height of Mark's window.

Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on Day 3. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the amount of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of protein in 100 grams of mushrooms:**
   - 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - Since 100 grams contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams will contain twice as much protein.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) grams of protein.

3. **Calculate the total amount of protein John gets in a day:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

4. **Calculate the total amount of protein John gets in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, in a week, John gets \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \) grams of protein.

The final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ 10 = J \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's sum up the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents.

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

Dogs have 4 legs each. There are 5 dogs, so the total number of legs for the dogs is:
\[ 5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs} \]

Cats have 4 legs each. There are 2 cats, so the total number of legs for the cats is:
\[ 2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs} \]

Birds have 2 legs each. There are 10 birds, so the total number of legs for the birds is:
\[ 10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs of all the pets together:
\[ 20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs in the pet store is:
\[ 48 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the initial weight Jamaal is using, which is 8 pounds. He increases this weight by 50%. To find the new weight after the increase, we calculate:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

This means that after the 50% increase, Jamaal is using a 12-pound weight. However, he finds this weight to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds. Therefore, the weight he now uses is:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight that Jamaal now uses is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after three years, we need to break down his purchases and gifts year by year.

- Games bought: 1 game per month for 12 months = 12 games
- Total games at the end of Year 1: 5 + 12 = 17 games

**Year 2:**
- Initial games: 17 (from Year 1)
- Games bought: 2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 17 + 24 = 41 games

**Year 3:**
- Initial games: 41 (from Year 2)
- Games bought: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games
- Games received for Christmas: 5 games
- Total games at the end of Year 3: 41 + 48 + 5 = 94 games

Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 94."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles at the same rate."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we have:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make in 12 hours. For Ruiz, who works at a rate of 60 pounds per hour:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa, who works at a rate of 45 pounds per hour:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the totals together gives us the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1260 \]"
"To determine how much money Howard has left after his arcade spending, we need to calculate the total amount he spends and subtract it from his initial amount.

First, let's calculate the amount Howard spends each day:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends four times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[
8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount:
\[
100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Howard has left is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next 2 hours are:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires of Jeremy's car undergo in a month, and then calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.

First, we calculate the number of rotations the tires make in a month:
- The car drives 400 miles a month.
- For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
- Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) rotations.
- So, the total number of rotations in 400 miles is \( 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \) rotations.

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
- The tires make 145,000 rotations per month.
- To find the number of months required for 10,440,000 rotations, we divide 10,440,000 by 145,000:
\[ \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, 72 months is equivalent to \( \frac{72}{12} = 6 \) years.

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we first need to calculate the total number of washes Jackie can get from a single bottle of shampoo. Given that the bottle costs $24.00 and the directions say to use 2 pumps to get 120 washes, we can deduce that:

- 1 pump gives 60 washes (since 120 washes are given for 2 pumps).

Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, so:

- 1 pump gives 60 washes.

Now, we need to find the cost of 1 pump. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, and this cost is for 2 pumps. Therefore, the cost of 1 pump is:

\[ \text{Cost of 1 pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{2} = \$12.00 \]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1 = 100$ cents):

\[ \$12.00 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is also a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"

1. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for one day:**
   - It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
   - Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.
   - Therefore, the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for one week:**
   - Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for the week is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) are funded at 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 per month.

   Let's calculate the funding per month for the extended period:
   - Initial funding per month: $100,000
   - Extended funding per month: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000

   Now, calculate the total funding for the extended 45 months:
   - Total extended funding: 45 months * $150,000/month = $6,750,000

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum the initial funding and the extended funding:
   - Total cost: $100,000 (initial) + $6,750,000 (extended) = $6,850,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of non-functioning street lights.

First, determine the number of poles at each intersection:
\[ \text{Number of poles per intersection} = 6 \]

Next, determine the number of intersections:
\[ \text{Number of intersections} = 4 \]

Calculate the total number of poles across all intersections:
\[ \text{Total number of poles} = 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles} \]

Each pole has 4 street lights:
\[ \text{Number of street lights per pole} = 4 \]

Calculate the total number of street lights:
\[ \text{Total number of street lights} = 24 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working:
\[ \text{Number of functioning street lights} = 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 85 \]"
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted. 

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. Therefore, the total number of flowers planted is:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find the number of flowers that have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ 200 \text{ flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 200 \times 0.8 = 160 \text{ flowers} \]

Thus, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:

\[ 160 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 160 \]"
"To calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per second by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per second.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb per second}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds per hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb per hour."
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled ten cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled ten cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars:

\[ \text{Cost paid by the company} = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the cost paid by the company:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

The number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, the price of the silver jewel is:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by summing the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[
\boxed{4800}
\]"
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

First, we know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

Next, we calculate the number of truck stamps. According to the problem, Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]

Then, we calculate the number of rose stamps. The problem states that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45 \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as \( t \) hours.

In \( t \) hours, Bob will have traveled \( 55t \) miles, and Tom will have traveled \( 70t \) miles. Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead, the distance Tom travels will be 75 miles more than the distance Bob travels. This can be expressed as:

\[ 70t = 55t + 75 \]

Now, let's solve for \( t \):

\[ 70t - 55t = 75 \]
\[ 15t = 75 \]
\[ t = \frac{75}{15} \]
\[ t = 5 \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
2. Now, since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 11 fish, Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[
x = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

According to the parents' condition, if the cost per class exceeds $10, they will not sign him up again. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can continue to sign up for classes.

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost per class exceeds $10. Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( n \). The number of classes he will attend is then \( 10 - n \).

The total cost for the classes he attends will be:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 60 - 6n
\]

The cost per class for the remaining \( 10 - n \) classes will be:
\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60 - 6n}{10 - n}
\]

We need this cost per class to be greater than $10:
\[
\frac{60 - 6n}{10 - n} > 10
\]

To solve this inequality, we first multiply both sides by \( 10 - n \) (noting that \( 10 - n > 0 \) since \( n < 10 \)):
\[
60 - 6n > 10(10 - n)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
60 - 6n > 100 - 10n
\]

Next, we move all terms involving \( n \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[
6n - 6n > 100 - 60
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
0 > 40
\]

This inequality is false, which means our initial assumption that the cost per class exceeds $10 is incorrect. Therefore, Manny can miss any number of classes as long as the total cost remains $60 and the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Since the cost per class is always $6, which is less than $10, Manny can miss all 10 classes and still be within the parents' condition.

Thus, the number of classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to establish the number of customers each of them processes daily.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes daily:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily customers by the number of days in a week:
\[ \text{Total weekly customers} = \text{Total daily customers} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

"To solve this, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \, \text{seconds} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is **$43,500**."
"To calculate Tim's annual salary after his promotion, we need to consider both his increased monthly salary and the bonus he receives.

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's raise is 5% of his $20000 monthly salary.
- 5% of $20000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \).

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
- $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- Half of $20000 is \( \frac{20000}{2} = 10000 \).

So, his total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, to find out how much he will make in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
- $31000 \times 12 = $372000.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{372000}

"To determine the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of each dress pant = 1/5 * $750 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420. If she had received her full weekly wage of $300, the amount in her bank account would be $200 (initial amount) + $300 (wage) = $520. However, the actual amount in her bank account is $420.

The difference between the amount she should have in her bank account and the actual amount in her bank account is the amount withheld from her wage.

So, the amount withheld is $520 - $420 = $100.

Therefore, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $100."
"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \times \frac{1 \text{ whole egg}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper. Therefore, she has written \( 15 \times \frac{1}{3} = 5 \) pages. 

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\( 15 - 5 = 10 \) pages.

Thus, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can calculate the number of days before the deadline by subtracting the number of days required to complete the reading from the total deadline days:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for renting a hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent the hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   Adding the initial cost of the plane to the annual expenses gives:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}
\]"
"Let's denote the cooking time for rice as \( R \), for beans as \( B \), and for pork as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The cooking time for beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 + 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Finally, to find out how much more it costs for the first mixture compared to the second mixture, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:

- The difference in cost is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 3 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads is 20.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive coffee:
1. Calculate 20% of $5:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]
2. Add this to the original price:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \]
So, the more expensive coffee costs $6 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost is the sum of the coffee cost and the donut cost:
\[ 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

Gus bought:
- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each, which totals $2.00 x 2 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is the difference between the total amount spent and the amount spent on the other items:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Thus, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600. The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209.

So, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = \text{Total newspapers} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C}) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we first need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. Therefore, the total number of hours per week is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class runs for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours spent in the class over the 6 weeks is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total number of class hours by the number of hours per recipe:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each person has and then share the total equally.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we know the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia has $120.
- Kassidy has $90.
- Rayna has $150.

To find the total amount of money, we add these amounts together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"The game originally consisted of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for the four quarters is:

\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, we need to determine the number of management employees in the company. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Given that 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.3 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final numerical answer is:

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ J = 21 \]

Substituting the value of \( J \) into the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The difference in height needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of toys required at each step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs one toy per dog.
   - He needs toys for the 8 new dogs.
   - Number of toys needed: 8

3. **Second Purchase:**
   - After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 4 original dogs + 8 new dogs = 12 dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs: 2 * 12 = 24 dogs.
   - James needs toys for these 24 dogs.
   - Number of toys needed: 24

4. **Third Purchase:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - Number of dogs remaining: 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
   - James no longer needs toys for these 3 dogs.
   - Number of toys needed: 21

Now, we sum up the total number of toys required:
- First purchase: 8 toys
- Second purchase: 24 toys
- Third purchase: 21 toys

Total number of toys needed:
\[ 8 + 24 + 21 = 53 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount:
\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances then invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment is the rest of the amount:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

We want to find out how many hash browns (let's call this number \( x \)) can be made from 96 potatoes.

So, we have the proportion:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{96 \times 36}{6} \]

\[ x = 16 \times 36 \]

\[ x = 576 \]

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can set up the following equation to represent the final length of the dress:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the time it takes to mow the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to find the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

For ""turtle"" mode:
- Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode.

For ""rabbit"" mode:
- Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, we sum the times for both halves of the lawn:
- Time in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time to mow the entire lawn:
\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write the equation:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 13."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of the five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one candy. Since four candies cost $1.20, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine the number of coins Rong saves per month and per year:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves \(20 \times 12 = 240\) coins per year.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins Rong saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Rong saves \(240 \times 10 = 2400\) coins.

Now, let's determine the number of coins Neil saves per month:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins Neil saves per year:
- Neil saves \(28 \times 12 = 336\) coins per year.

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Neil saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Neil saves \(336 \times 10 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil in ten years is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
5760"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price for a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. Given that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as an apple:
\[ \text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[ \text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the bananas, apples, and oranges in the crate.

For the bananas:
\[ \text{Total cost for bananas} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

For the apples:
\[ \text{Total cost for apples} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

For the oranges:
\[ \text{Total cost for oranges} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price for the crate:
\[ \text{Total price for the crate} = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs required and compare it to the number of chairs currently available.

First, we calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we know that the restaurant currently has 8 high chairs. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Adding the high chairs and the regular chairs together, we get the total number of chairs currently available:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs required:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Thus, the number of 8 point bucks is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the points collected by each student.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom:
\[
50 + 105 + 65 + 35 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the number of points the class is missing is:

Therefore, if all of the family show up at the family reunion, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To solve this, we first calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account and how much she pays for her car payment.

1. Retirement Account Contribution:
   50% of $2400.00 = 0.50 * $2400.00 = $1200.00

2. Car Payment:
   20% of $2400.00 = 0.20 * $2400.00 = $480.00

3. Total Deductions:
   Retirement Account Contribution + Car Payment = $1200.00 + $480.00 = $1680.00

4. Money Left to Spend:
   Total Paycheck - Total Deductions = $2400.00 - $1680.00 = $720.00

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00."

Thus, the group has spent a total of $200 on drinks and snacks."
"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we first need to determine the capacity of Gordy's truck and then use the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gissela, Gordy, and Gary join together, their combined capacity is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that each female ate 3 dumplings and there were 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, we get the total number of dumplings cooked:

\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

"To determine how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to find the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Given that the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100% to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by Colorado City is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage percentage from 100%:
\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:
\[ \boxed{68\%} \]"

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

"To solve this, we need to determine how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00, given the deal of ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free.""

First, let's calculate how many free scoops she can get with her $6.00. Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide her total money by the cost per scoop:

\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \]

This means Erin can get 4 free scoops with her $6.00. 

Now, let's see how many scoops she can buy with the deal. For every 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free), she spends $4.50 (2 scoops at $1.50 each plus 1 free scoop at $1.50). 

To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00, we divide her total money by the cost for 3 scoops:

\[ \frac{6.00}{4.50} = 1.3333... \]

Since she can only buy whole sets of 3 scoops, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops, which means she can buy 2 scoops and get 1 free scoop. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 scoops of ice cream."
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them consumes over that period.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover with mosaic tiles. 

The total area of the bathroom is 36 square feet. He wants to cover two-thirds of this area. 

To find the area to be covered, we calculate:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot. To find the total number of tiles needed for the 24 square feet, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 24 \times 24 = 576 \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

\[
\boxed{576}

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds.

The cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost for James to pick the blueberries is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price per pound at the store is $2.5.

The cost for 30 pounds at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, we need to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store. The savings can be calculated as:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

Therefore, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original total cost for 500 computers is:
\[ 500 \times 700 = 350000 \]

Since this is the total cost for 500 computers, the original price per computer is:
\[ \frac{350000}{500} = 700 \]

Now, the price of each computer increased by 10%. The new price per computer is:
\[ 700 \times 1.10 = 770 \]

Finally, the total amount of money paid for 500 computers at the new price is:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to sum the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, we calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg is 75 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 oz of cheese.
- Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
- Therefore, the total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Then, we calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses 2 oz of ham.
- Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
- Therefore, the total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Finally, we sum the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
- Total calories = 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories.

Thus, the total number of calories in the omelet is 770 calories."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils. Therefore, the total cost for the pencils is:

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she dances.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

For 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 minutes):
- Total taps = 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

For 2 minutes:
- Total taps = 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

Finally, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:
- Total taps = 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 2450."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then compare it to the potential damage to his car.

1. **Cost of asphalt:**
   - Ron needs 3 buckets of asphalt.
   - Each bucket costs $25.
   - Total cost for asphalt = 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.

2. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance:**
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.

3. **Total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Total cost = Cost of asphalt + Fine for unauthorized road maintenance
   - Total cost = $75 + $120 = $195.

4. **Damage to the car:**
   - If the pothole is not fixed, it will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car.

5. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**
   - Money saved = Potential damage to the car - Total cost of fixing the pothole
   - Money saved = $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:
- Normal chairs left: 150
- Baby chairs left: 10
- Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \left(12 \times \frac{2}{3}\right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left(12 \times \frac{3}{4}\right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by all five friends:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

Given:
- The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
- The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) the time the cat takes.

First, calculate the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages:
\[
\text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times and dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length is:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. 

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \times 1 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 32 \times 1.5 = 48
\]

Now, we sum the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The number of blue spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Thus, the percentage of her spools that are blue is 40%."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.

First, calculate the number of people who had voted by midday:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday was:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday were 3000, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 was:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

The number of those who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of gum he will need to get 120 pieces. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. Therefore, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Thus, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. Therefore, the total number of smores needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores. Therefore, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves of graham crackers, they will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To solve the problem, we will first determine the ages of Dora's father and mother based on the information provided.

1. **Dora's Age:**
   Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Dora's Father's Age:**
   According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
   \]
   Substituting Dora's age:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Dora's Mother's Age:**
   Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
   \]
   Substituting the father's age:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
   \]

4. **Total Combined Age:**
   Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.
   \[
   \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age}

"To find the total weight of all of Cindy's books, we need to add up the weights of each individual book.

First, we know that Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. Since she has two of each, the total weight of the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that her French book weighs 4 pounds. So, the weight of the French book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \]

We also know that her English book weighs 3 pounds. So, the weight of the English book is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 0.50 \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to update the number of apples each person has after this exchange:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[
\text{Difference in apples} = 90 - 87 = 3

"To determine how much water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, let's determine how much water Peter has left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water used = 30 ounces.
- Water left = 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is 2."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, Steven has half the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, 1/3 of the 12 birds were scared away. 

To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate 1/3 of 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 40 students are girls and how many are boys. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, 60% of the students in each class are boys.

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 \times \frac{60}{100} = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To calculate the savings, we first need to determine the total cost for each amusement park and then find the difference between the two costs.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $26 = $52.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $12 = $24.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $14 = $28.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $10 = $20.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the two total costs:
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28.

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost per day before the switch:
- He used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $0.5 each.
- Cost per day before = 500 * $0.5 = $250.

Next, let's calculate the cost per day after the switch:
- He now buys 500 tomatoes a day at $0.4 each.
- Cost per day after = 500 * $0.4 = $200.

Now, we find the daily savings:
- Daily savings = Cost per day before - Cost per day after
- Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, we calculate the weekly savings:
- Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7 days
- Weekly savings = $50 * 7 = $350.

Thus, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of marbles each person has based on the information provided.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we calculate Carl's marbles as follows:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so we calculate Cal's marbles as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]
4. To find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's and Cal's marbles together:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336

The final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into six groups. We then need to find out how many groups are needed if the activity is divided into twelve groups.

First, we calculate the number of students per group if there are six groups:
\[
\frac{54}{6} = 9
\]
So, each of the six groups will have 9 students.

Next, we need to determine how many groups are needed if the activity is divided into twelve groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]
Since we cannot have half a group, we need to round up to the next whole number, which means we need 5 groups to accommodate all 54 students. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form if the activity is divided into twelve groups, implying we need to find the difference between the required number of groups and the current number of groups (which is 6).

The number of additional groups needed is:
\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental numbers for weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
- Therefore, in one week, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekend:
- There are 2 days in a weekend.
- Candy rents 100 chairs each day during the weekend.
- Therefore, in one weekend, the number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- In one month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(4 \times 300 = 1200\) chairs.
- The number of chairs rented during weekends is \(4 \times 200 = 800\) chairs.
- Therefore, in one month, the total number of chairs rented is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- In two months, the total number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs.

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas step by step.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther initially had 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half:**
   Arnold stole half of the bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals another 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Thus, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:
\[
\boxed{43}

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1200 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Since there are 4 roommates, each roommate will pay:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ dollars/year}}{4 \text{ roommates}} = 300 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is \(8 \times 12 = 96\).
- He sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

Next, we account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, we calculate the number of glasses and plates that are not broken:

- The number of glasses not broken is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- The number of plates not broken is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, we add the number of glasses and plates that are not broken to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now:

- Total number of glasses and plates = \(86 + 42 = 128\).

The final numerical answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of stickers and buttons Lorraine has at each step of the trading process.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \)
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \)
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has 107 buttons."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to sum the matches he played on each day of the week.

1. Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. Joey played 1 match on Friday.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we add the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). Consequently, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

Given that the total number of people on the council is 33, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. Consequently, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first need to determine the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133."

Given:
- Number of songs in one playlist = 300
- Number of playlists = 20
- Length of each song = 10 hours

First, calculate the total number of songs across all playlists:
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 300 \times 20 = 6000 \]

Next, calculate the total number of hours across all playlists:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the big race. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 

To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \text{ are Pomeranians} \]

We are also informed that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}P = 6 \]
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 3 \times 9 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Therefore, after receiving the money from his sister, Jayden has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so the amount Jayden still needs to buy the camera is $200 - $115 = $85. 

The final numerical answer is $85."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \). According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, which is \( \frac{1}{2}x \). The third house needs double the first house, which is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
5x = 500
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs \( x \), which is 100 cases. Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, we first calculate the number of pears he has.

To find 45% of 200 bananas:
\[ 45\% \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than the 200 bananas he has. Therefore, the total number of pears is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Adding the number of bananas and pears together gives the total number of fruits George has:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits George has is 490."
"First, let's determine how much money Marissa spent on the ball. She had $80 and spent $20 on the ball. Therefore, the remaining money she has is:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining $60, given that each candy bar costs $5. We do this by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

Thus, the final numerical answer is 60 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed must have read half of that amount:

Ahmed's books = Ezra's books / 2
Ahmed's books = 300 / 2
Ahmed's books = 150

Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. 

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books Ezra has read. Ezra initially read 300 books and decided to read 150 more:

Ezra's total books = Initial books + Additional books
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150
Ezra's total books = 450

Now, we add the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed to find the total number of books read altogether:

Total books = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's books
Total books = 450 + 150
Total books = 600

Therefore, the total number of books read altogether is 600."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate her base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, her total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate her base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total Earnings for the Two Days:**
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching."
"To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents by the end of the day.

The difference in sales is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Sales of Vanilla Scents} - \text{Sales of Fruity Scents} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet has already earned from selling the eggplants.

He sold 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the earnings from the eggplants are:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to earn from selling the corn is:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Tatiana spends on each activity and then calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer.

First, let's calculate the total time Tatiana has over the weekend:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. Therefore, the remaining time after reading is:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time after reading. So, the time spent on video games is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can determine the time spent on soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total weekend time:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Thus, the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we will follow the steps of the problem:

1. Anthony initially had 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. Therefore, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25
   \]
3. Anthony then gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. The number of pencils given to Charlie is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Thus, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine how many wheels Henry will have left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he needs to assemble 57 cars, the total number of wheels required for the cars is:
\[ 57 \times 4 = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for the motorcycles is:
\[ 73 \times 2 = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding the wheels required for the cars and motorcycles gives the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

"First, let's break down the problem into parts and calculate the cost step by step.

Mike has a total of 600 movies. 

1. A third of the movies are in various series. 
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   These movies can be bought for $6 each, so the cost for these movies is:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The remaining movies are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]
   40% of these remaining movies are older movies which are $5 each. 
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies}
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies, which are $10 each. 
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies}
   \]
   The cost for these normal movies is:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the movies:

For peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
For plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
For apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:

$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of that speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:

\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she gets 30 points less than Emma for the timer. Let's denote the points Emma gets for the timer as \( T_E \). Then Ava gets \( T_E - 30 \) points for the timer. The scores for Ava and Emma can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_A + 5B_A + (T_E - 30) \]
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \]

Substituting \( E_A \) and \( B_A \) in terms of \( E_E \) and \( B_E \):

\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + (T_E - 30) \]
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E \]

Simplifying Ava's score:

\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + T_E - 30 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65 \]

Now, the difference in their scores is:

\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E + 65) - (10E_E + 5B_E + T_E) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 65 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 65 points."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. If two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, then the combined cost of these two pizzas is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost of the four pizzas gives us the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts:

1. **Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on 5 days.
   - Twice the times they do on usual days on 2 days.

2. **Calculate Biking Frequency for Usual Days:**
   - On usual days, they ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - Therefore, in 5 days, they ride their bikes \(3 \times 5 = 15\) times.

3. **Calculate Biking Frequency for Extra Days:**
   - On the extra days, they ride their bikes twice the usual amount.
   - Twice the usual amount is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) times a day.
   - Therefore, in 2 days, they ride their bikes \(6 \times 2 = 12\) times.

4. **Total Biking Frequency for the Week:**
   - Summing up the biking frequency for all days:
   - Usual days: 15 times
   - Extra days: 12 times
   - Total biking frequency for the week: \(15 + 12 = 27\) times.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify this equation:

\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):

\[ o = 17 - w \]

Substitute this expression for \( o \) into the second equation:

\[ 17 - w - 2w = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3w = 5 \]
\[ -3w = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3w = -12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o + w = 17 \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we first need to determine the total distance he travels in a week and then calculate the amount of fuel he consumes.

Andy travels to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 10 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Given that Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the amount of fuel he consumes in a week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, so the cost of the fuel Andy consumes in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times $3/\text{gallon} = $15/\text{week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15/\text{week} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total value of the quarters:**
   - Carrie has 140 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = 140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35.

2. **Calculate the total value of the twenties:**
   - Carrie has 10 twenties.
   - Each twenty is worth $20.
   - Total value of twenties = 10 twenties * $20/twenty = $200.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on the twenties:**
   - She spent 3/5 of the twenties.
   - Amount spent on twenties = 3/5 * $200 = $120.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch:**
   - Total amount spent = Amount spent on quarters + Amount spent on twenties.
   - Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is $155."
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be overcome to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the temperature during the night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the temperature during the night is 12 degrees, we need to increase it to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. The temperature increase needed is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees in one month.
3. Multiply the total salary for one month by the number of months (three).

**Step 1: Number of employees after three months**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Total salary paid to all employees in one month**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all 260 employees in one month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Total salary paid to all employees after three months**

Since the total salary paid to all employees in one month is $1,040,000, the total salary paid after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of students in the school:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \times 2 = 240 \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers is:
\[ 1000 + 240 = 1240 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- Three stuffed puppies
- Five stuffed koalas
- Two stuffed zebras
- Four stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \). According to the problem, the percentage of goats should be 30%, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 (14 + x) \]

Next, we distribute the 0.30 on the right side:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Now, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Finally, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the hours Kris has already played.

First, calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
- Therefore, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, calculate the hours played in the following week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total hours played in the following week is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the following week:
- Total hours played = 7 hours (first 2 weeks) + 14 hours (following week) = 21 hours.

Finally, to find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal:
- Hours needed = 30 hours (goal) - 21 hours (played) = 9 hours.

Therefore, the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement is 9 hours."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost including premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

The final numerical answer is $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 passed.
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \) passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on its height and the area it can cover.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has. He has two bags, and each bag contains 72 chips:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we use the area formula for a rectangle (length times height):
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is 4 inches."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together, the total amount of tea consumed by all the students is:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students have consumed the tea. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this is the total number of branches climbed during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and then subtract the petals of the flowers she lost.

First, she picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picked:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose dropped 1 flower from each of the four types, so she lost:
\[ 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the petals she lost from the total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they have used 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally contained 35 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left after making the S'mores is:

\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time each person plays and then calculate the total number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total play time from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we'll determine the play time for each person:
1. **Jack**: He plays for the full 240 minutes.
2. **Friend 1**: He can play for half as long as Jack:
   \[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
3. **Friend 2**: He can play for half as long as Jack:
   \[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
4. **Friend 3**: He can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack:
   \[ 1.5 \times 240 = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the number of quarters each person uses:
1. **Jack**: 
   \[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]
2. **Friend 1**: 
   \[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 6 \text{ quarters} \]
3. **Friend 2**: 
   \[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 6 \text{ quarters} \]
4. **Friend 3**: 
   \[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 18 \text{ quarters} \]

Finally, we sum the total number of quarters used:
\[ 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of salt used as \( S \) ounces. According to the problem, the amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the oil used is \( 2S \) ounces. The amount of fragrance used is the same as the amount of zest, so let's denote the amount of zest and fragrance as \( F \) ounces. The amount of sugar used is the same as the amount of salt, so the sugar used is also \( S \) ounces.

The total amount of the mixture is the sum of the amounts of salt, oil, fragrance, zest, and sugar. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + 2S + F + F + S = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 4S + 2F = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[ 2S + F = 5 \]
Since \( F = S \), we can substitute \( F \) with \( S \) in the equation:
\[ 2S + S = 5 \]
\[ 3S = 5 \]
\[ S = \frac{5}{3} \]
The amount of oil used is \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]
Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer in fractional form is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

The cost of the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

The cost of the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Therefore, the number of additional cupcakes he needs to buy is calculated as follows:

\[ 63 - (8 + 40) = 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's start by determining the number of cars Joe initially has. Given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars Robert has} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Joe then sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ \text{Number of cars sold} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Therefore, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ \text{Number of cars given away} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars sold} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

To find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother, we subtract the number of cars sold and the number of cars given away from the initial number of cars Joe had:

\[ \text{Number of cars Joe remains with} = \text{Initial number of cars} - \text{Number of cars sold} - \text{Number of cars given away} \]
\[ \text{Number of cars Joe remains with} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250."
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days in minutes.

First, let's determine the time Sandy spent walking on the first day. According to the problem, Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we need to calculate the time she spent walking on the second day. The problem states that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time spent walking on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we add the time spent walking on both days to find the total time in hours:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour equals 60 minutes:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

When he got out of class for the lunch break, half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is 70 / 2 = 35 cars. This is the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break. 

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To determine how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate his daily earnings:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- Each task pays $1.20.

So, the earnings per cycle are:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Now, his daily earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00/\text{day} = \$1260.00/\text{week} \]

Thus, John makes:
\[ \$1260.00 \]
if he works a full 7 day week."
"To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate the points scored in each game and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the first game:
- Sasha scored 14 points.
- Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

Next, we calculate the points scored by Sasha and Julie in the second game:
- Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
- Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we sum up the points scored by Sasha in both games:
- Points scored by Sasha in the first game: 14
- Points scored by Sasha in the second game: 4
- Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:

\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 153 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:

\[
5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The loss Milly will incur is the total shipping cost minus the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the loss cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:
\[ 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gives her an additional $100, so she now has $40 + $100 = $140. She then spends $30 on the first pair of jeans, $30 on the second pair of jeans, and $20 on the bag. The total amount spent is $30 + $30 + $20 = $80. Therefore, the amount of money she has left is $140 - $80 = $60. 

The final numerical answer is $60."
"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

First, let's calculate the production for each of the first three weeks:
- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's sum the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Thus, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is:
\[ \boxed{14000} \]"

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs each week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For a month with 4 weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 1128 minutes."
"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the base cost and the additional cost for the extra items.

First, let's calculate the base cost. The base cost includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost for this base installation is $129.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs. She has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed. The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

The number of additional shelves Angela needs is \(6 - 4 = 2\), the number of additional chandeliers is \(2 - 1 = 1\), and the number of additional pictures is \(20 - 10 = 10\).

So, the cost for the additional items is calculated as follows:
\[2 \text{ shelves} \times \$15.00/\text{shelf} + 1 \text{ chandelier} \times \$15.00/\text{chandelier} + 10 \text{ pictures} \times \$15.00/\text{picture} = 2 \times 15 + 1 \times 15 + 10 \times 15 = 30 + 15 + 150 = \$195.00\]

Adding the base cost and the additional cost gives us the total cost:
\[\$129.00 + \$195.00 = \$324.00\]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony's savings can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei.

First, let's establish the lifting capacity of Pompei:
- Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

Next, we find out how high Saskay can lift a mountain:
- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
- Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.

Now, we determine how high Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
- Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
- Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.

Finally, we calculate how high Naruto can lift a mountain:
- Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
- Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

To convert the height Naruto can lift a mountain from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \(12\) inches per foot:
- \(480\) inches is equivalent to \(\frac{480}{12} = 40\) feet.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the animals and the time it takes for them to travel the same distance.

First, let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \) and the speed of the kangaroos as \( v \). Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), we can write the equation for the distance as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). Let \( t \) be the time it takes for the 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \). The distance can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t \]
\[ D = 2v \times t \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]
\[ 54 = 2t \]
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ t = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the number of dishes each person made based on the information provided:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[ \text{Total dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 20 + 40 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total dishes} = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."

2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, which totals $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to find in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam decides to slice 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam decides to slice 5 small apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we first determine the additional amount of milk required:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
\[ \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 2 \text{ mm} \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
\[ \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ mm} \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
\[ \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm} = 6 \text{ mm} \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue left in all three sticks:
\[ 2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 16 \text{ mm} \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters."

"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
- Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).
- Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting the value of \( D \), we get \( 60 = 2S \), which means \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total socks = Socks Jack has + Socks Peter has = 30 + 60 = 90.
- Total dishes = Dishes Jack has + Dishes Peter has = 60 + 30 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is:
180"
"To determine the number of students who are good at math, we need to consider the given information and apply basic set theory principles.

We know:
- Total number of students = 20
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students performing well in English only = 8
- Students good at both math and English = \(20 - 5 - 8 = 7\)

The total number of students good at math includes those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English. Therefore, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ 5 \text{ (good at math only)} + 7 \text{ (good at both math and English)} = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, as well as the intermission.

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

Additionally, there is a 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total time required for one group, including the intermission, is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes per group} \]

The concert itself lasts for 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many groups can perform within the 120-minute concert duration, we divide the total concert time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

Thus, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The original investment (principal) is $300. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is:
\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $300, the rate is 225 dollars per year, and the time is 3 years. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

First, calculate \(300 \times 225\):
\[ 300 \times 225 = 67500 \]

Then, multiply the result by 3:
\[ 67500 \times 3 = 202500 \]

So, the total interest earned over 3 years is $202,500. Adding this to the original investment gives:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 202500 = 202800 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{202800} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. We know that half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so the other half do not. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, so the remaining floral shirts do not have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. We have already calculated that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. The difference between these two quantities is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 10 more than the number of white shirts with no collars. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the farmer will earn:

\[
\boxed{75}

"To solve the problem, let's first determine the number of goats sold from each farm and then calculate the remaining number of goats.

1. **Goats sold from Farm X:**
   Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.

2. **Goats sold from Farm Y:**
   He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Therefore, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

3. **Remaining goats in Farm X:**
   Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, the remaining number of goats in Farm X is:
   \[
   55 - 10 = 45
   \]

4. **Remaining goats in Farm Y:**
   Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, the remaining number of goats in Farm Y is:
   \[
   45 - 20 = 25
   \]

5. **Total remaining goats in both farms:**
   Adding the remaining goats from both farms:
   \[
   45 + 25 = 70
   \]

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs bought in a year:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 110 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the total discount for the red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned: \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms: \( 45 \times 20 \) minutes.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we will calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

Next, in the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
So, in the second year, they will build 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]
Therefore, in the third year, they will build:
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \]
So, in the third year, they will build 96 homes.

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Let's denote my age as \( x \). Then, my brother's age is \( x + 3 \) and my sister's age is \( x - 2 \). My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs he needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

On the second day, the amount of water doubles from the first day, so it is:
\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons from the second day, so it is:
\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days is:
\[ 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 26000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people each day, starting with the initial number of infected people and considering the rate of infection.

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - Day 0: 10 people are infected.

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
   - Total number of infected people on Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

3. **Day 2:**
   - Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
   - Total number of infected people on Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

4. **Day 3:**
   - Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
   - Total number of infected people on Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips as follows:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received in tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual totals:

\[ \text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's total tips} + \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

The final numerical answer is 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the time frame and the number of badges earned by each person.

Claire earns a badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Thus, Amber takes 2 months to earn a badge. In a year, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \) badges.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we determine the number of banana bread loaves she can bake in those 5 hours:
- Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour.
- Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) loaves.

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from the 10 loaves:
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices is \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) slices.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 80 slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and we know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed.
3. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

Given:
- The rink has 12 red cars.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
- The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

Let's calculate the number of green cars:
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars:
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Finally, we find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars in the rink:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's verify this:
- Fawn has \( F = 28 \) books.
- Anne has \( A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \) books.
- Sofie has \( S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \) books.
- The total number of books is \( S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \), which matches the given total.

Thus, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. We know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15.00 \]"

   \[
   \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240
   \]
3. **Keenan's share**: The remaining 40% of $400
   \[
   \text{Keenan's share} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160
   \]
4. **Keenan's weekly expenditure**: Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly expenditure} = \frac{160}{4} = 40

Thus, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Remaining after First Day**: After eating 24 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Second Day**: Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To determine how much money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.

The cost of one bolt is $0.03. Therefore, the cost of 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Thus, the final amount of money David has left is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to calculate her hourly rate. We know that she earned $33 for 3 hours of work. Therefore, her hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn in 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:

\[ \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him the marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is 60."
"To determine the total score Amy achieves on the history test, we need to calculate the number of correct answers for each type of question and then multiply by their respective point values.

First, let's calculate the number of correct multiple-choice answers:
- There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
- Amy correctly answers 80% of them.
- Number of correct multiple-choice answers = \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of correct true/false answers:
- There are 20 true/false questions.
- Amy correctly answers 90% of them.
- Number of correct true/false answers = \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \).

Then, let's calculate the number of correct long-answer answers:
- There are 5 long-answer questions.
- Amy correctly answers 60% of them.
- Number of correct long-answer answers = \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \).

Now, we calculate the total score by multiplying the number of correct answers by their respective point values:
- Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
- Each true/false question is worth 1 point.
- Each long-answer question is worth 5 points.

Total score from multiple-choice questions = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points.
Total score from true/false questions = \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) points.
Total score from long-answer questions = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) points.

Finally, we sum up all the points:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

Thus, Amy's total score is 41 points."
"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, so together they sold \(32 - 14 = 18\) glasses. Since they sold an equal number, each of them sold \(18 / 2 = 9\) glasses. Julie sold 14 glasses, so Julie sold \(14 - 9 = 5\) more glasses than Micah.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to determine how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

\[
\text{Money left after selling the rope} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Sarah has no money left after selling the original rope, she cannot buy any new rope. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age as \( x \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + x \). We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Total cost for bacon: 5 packs * $2/pack = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Total cost for chicken: 6 packets * $4/packet = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each pack costs $4.
   - Total cost for strawberries: 3 packs * $4/pack = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for apples: 7 packs * $2/pack = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is $5."
"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 25 \) back into the equation:

\[ 2(25) + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65 \]

The equation holds true, so the usual length of Elaina's concerts is indeed 25 minutes. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Argo initially had 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys. 

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on the specified days, we will calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday:**
   - Number of chimichangas made: 125

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Number of chimichangas made: 125

3. **Friday:**
   - Number of chimichangas made: Twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 125 = 250 \)

Now, we sum the number of chimichangas made on these three days:
\[
125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500
\]

Thus, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is:
\[
\boxed{500}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. 

Given that the singer has 50 microphones, 20% of them won't fit, which means 80% of the microphones will fit in pairs. 

Let's calculate 80% of 50 microphones:

\[ 0.80 \times 50 = 40 \]

So, 40 microphones can be arranged in pairs. 

To find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the number of microphones that fit into pairs by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. 

To find the number of birds flying overhead, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. Therefore, the total number of birds feeding is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:
- Birds nesting in the bushes: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, leaving her with 55 - 5 = 50 cookies. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into five jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is 50 / 5 = 10. 

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the African daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the African daisies:
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Thus, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants is:

\[ 25\% \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 25 \]"
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob is:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot per day, we first need to calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt.

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know that Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. This total includes the cost of two carrots, the salad, and the yogurt. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} + \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = \$11 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} + \$6 + \$3 = \$11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} + \$9 = \$11 \]

Subtracting \$9 from both sides:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} = \$2 \]

Since the cost of two carrots is $2, the cost of one carrot is:

\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\$2}{2} = \$1 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$1 \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise:

New hourly wage: $10 + $2 = $12

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week:

Hours per day: 8
Days per week: 5
Total hours per week: 8 * 5 = 40

Now, we calculate Mark's weekly earnings with his new hourly wage:

Weekly earnings: Total hours per week * New hourly wage
Weekly earnings: 40 * $12 = $480

The final numerical answer is $480."
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 3x \) lawns for Kamala.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 5x \) lawns for Alba.

The total number of lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, we can assume that the total earnings from mowing lawns is $80, and the earnings from mowing lawns are $6 for Joe's lawn. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns for Kamala and Alba combined is \( 80 - 6 = 74 \) dollars.

Since the ratio of the number of lawns mowed for Kamala and Alba to the number mowed for Joe is \( 3x : x : 5x \), the earnings from mowing lawns for Kamala and Alba are in the same ratio. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns for Kamala and Alba combined can be divided as follows:
- Kamala's earnings: \( \frac{3}{9} \times 74 = \frac{1}{3} \times 74 = \frac{74}{3} \approx 24.67 \) dollars.
- Alba's earnings: \( \frac{5}{9} \times 74 = \frac{5}{3} \times 74 = \frac{370}{3} \approx 123.33 \) dollars.

Adding these together, we get \( 24.67 + 123.33 = 148 \) dollars, which is incorrect as it exceeds the total earnings from mowing lawns. This indicates a need to recheck the ratio application, but the correct division should be:

- Kamala's earnings: \( \frac{3}{9} \times 74 = \frac{1}{3} \times 74 = 24.67 \) dollars.
- Alba's earnings: \( \frac{5}{9} \times 74 = \frac{5}{3} \times 74 = 123.33 \) dollars.

The correct total from mowing lawns is \( 24.67 + 123.33 = 148 \) dollars, but the correct division should be \( 24 + 123 = 147 \) dollars, which is still incorrect. The correct division should be \( 24 + 123 = 147 \) dollars, but the correct total is \( 24 + 123 = 147 \) dollars.

Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns are \( 24 + 123 = 147 \) dollars, and the earnings from lemonade sales are \( 80 - 147 = -67 \) dollars, which is incorrect.

"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 + 16 = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 + 8 = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 - 5 = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, John's profit on his car is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

"To find the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Denise read:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Therefore, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pages Daniel read:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel read 0 pages.
- Therefore, the total number of pages Daniel read is \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

Now, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:
- Denise read 28 pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages.
- The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

Thus, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is in the pot and how much will be left after Calvin, his wife, and their two children have eaten.

First, let's establish the capacity of the pot:
- The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls.
- The pot can fill 8 child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will eat one bowl of soup as well. This means that 2 adult bowls of soup have been consumed.

Now, we have 2 child's bowls of soup left in the pot. Since there are 2 children, each child can have one bowl of soup. Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material required = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on various activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim has left after using some of them.

First, let's calculate the number of blue shoe boxes Tim uses:
- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of red shoe boxes Tim uses:
- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes.

To find \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 9:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes used is 3. Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Now, we sum up the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 6

Thus, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the ages of Duncan and Adam in the past.

Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Let Adam's current age be \( A \). Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. In 8 years, Adam will be:

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Therefore, we calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \times \text{Size of Farmer Brown's farm} + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 2 \times 200 + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 400 + 100 \]
\[ \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add the sizes of both farms to find the total number of acres:

\[ \text{Total acres} = \text{Size of Farmer Brown's farm} + \text{Size of Farmer Smith's farm} \]
\[ \text{Total acres} = 200 + 500 \]
\[ \text{Total acres} = 700 \]

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Thus, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the expenses and the total amount spent:

1. **Cake Cost**: $11
2. **Balloons Cost**: 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. **Ice Cream Cost**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the cost is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and then find the number of cups of mint tea in each row.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows, with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. Let's denote the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row as \( x \) and the number of cups of mint tea in each row as \( x \) as well. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is \( 2x \).

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

This means:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. We need to find out how many such trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of water in the tank.
2. Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, given the rate of emptying.

First, we know that the pool contains 10000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water emptied in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this amount from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining water:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \]

"Given the constraints, let's break down the costs and the available funds:

- Colby has $150 to spend.
- He has already spent money on 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy, which totals $8 + 4 * $2 = $16.
- Therefore, he has $150 - $16 = $134 left to spend.

Now, let's calculate the cost of a movie ticket and the additional costs for popcorn and candy. Since it is a Friday, the ticket costs $10. He also wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which costs $8 + $2 = $10.

So, for each movie he watches, he spends $10 on the ticket and $10 on the popcorn and candy, totaling $20 per movie.

With $134 left, he can afford to watch $134 / $20 = 6.7 movies. Since he can't watch a fraction of a movie, he can watch 6 full movies.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories from all the pastries:
- Total calories = \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys Sophie already has from the total number of toys for her nephew.

The total number of other toys Sophie has is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \]

The total number of toys for her nephew is 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: \( P + Q + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Q = J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Q + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):

\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:

\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:

\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):

\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years."
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria herself had 1 water balloon. So, before her mom gave them more, the total number of water balloons was \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(9 + 15 = 24\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes of their own stuff, so the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

Zoey's total distance:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney's total distance:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we find the average total distance by adding the total distances and dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total production and revenue for each machine over a month.

- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets:
- Each widget sells for $6.

Total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under two scenarios: the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, we can find out how much Cameron would save by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:

John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

Therefore, John can buy 4 pens. The final numerical answer is:

"In the first part of the problem, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in each row and then multiply by the number of rows.

First, we know that there are 8 children in each row. There are 7 rows for each school, and there are 5 different schools. Therefore, the total number of children can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children} \]

2. Since there are 5 different schools, we multiply the number of children in one school by the number of schools:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The parts cost: $60

Now, we sum these components:

Total charge = Fixed visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

Therefore, Patty's Plumbing charged $205 for the job."
"To determine how much money James was out, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount.
2. Apply the 40% discount to find the total cost after the discount.
3. Subtract the cost of the CDs he decided to keep from the total cost after the discount.
4. Subtract the amount he received from selling the CDs he didn't like from the cost of the CDs he decided to keep.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total cost of the CDs before the discount is:
\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

2. The discount is 40%, so the total cost after the discount is:
\[ \$150 \times (1 - 0.40) = \$150 \times 0.60 = \$90 \]

3. James decides to keep 5 CDs, so the cost of the CDs he decided to keep is:
\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$75 \]

4. James sells 5 CDs for $40, so the money he received from selling the CDs is $40. Therefore, the amount of money he was out is:
\[ \$75 - \$40 = \$35 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells all of her root crops."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed at which James swims the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from New York Times sales is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from Wall Street Journal sales is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission from NYT} + \text{Commission from WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

Therefore, Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = A + 20 \)
2. \( B = D + 10 \)
3. \( B + A + D = 45 \)

First, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \) into the third equation:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 20 - 10) = 45 \]
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. To verify, we can find the points scored by Bahati and Dinar:
\[ B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in one inch:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \text{ pages} \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate the total number of reports he stapled.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours or 480 minutes of sleep.

On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is a total of 23 minutes.

Therefore, the total time she was not asleep (sleepwalking and waking up early) is 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was not asleep from her total sleep time:

480 minutes (total sleep time) - 23 minutes (time not asleep) = 457 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 457 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 24 cups. According to the problem, Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. The number of measuring spoons he has left after giving 6 to Pedro is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Jonathan still has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, the total number of utensils is:

\[
24 + 10 = 34

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means Robyn sends six emails to her family each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. The number of non-work emails after sending emails to her family is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Robyn sends one-third of the remaining emails to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, Robyn sends one email to her boyfriend each day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To find Shawna's father's age, we first need to determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

If Courtney reported 48 people, then 20% of 48 is calculated as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Since Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we subtract this 20% from the reported number:

\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4. However, since the number of people must be a whole number, and considering the context of a concert where fractional people are not possible, we can conclude that the closest whole number to 38.4 is 38.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 38 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:

- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

Adding these together gives the total number of balls:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine the number of holes dug by the pirates on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but then they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Since the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the sum of what Amora and Lainey received, we can calculate the number of corn chips Collins received as follows:

Collins' chips = (Amora's chips + Lainey's chips) + 15
Collins' chips = (70 + 70) + 15
Collins' chips = 140 + 15
Collins' chips = 155

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

Total chips = Amora's chips + Lainey's chips + Collins' chips
Total chips = 70 + 70 + 155
Total chips = 300

Therefore, the total number of corn chips was 300."
"To determine the cost of travel, we first need to calculate 50% of the cost of supplies. The cost of supplies is $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

The total cost of travel is 50% more than the cost of supplies. Therefore, we add the 50% to the original cost of supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode. It is also stated that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we have:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[
\boxed{446}

"To determine the number of individual brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and the number she consumed, then subtract the latter from the former.

First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies.
- At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.

We need to convert all quantities to the same unit, such as individual brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, we can calculate as follows:

- 1 dozen brownies = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen brownies = 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen brownies = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies

Adding these together gives the total number of brownies received:

12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office party) + 48 (from the friends' party) = 66 brownies

Next, we calculate the number of brownies eaten during the party:

- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
- 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:

66 (total brownies received) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"Nani's brother is twice his age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\) years."
"To determine the total time Andy will take to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of racquet and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time for the racquets strung with synthetic gut:
\[ 3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time for the racquets strung with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the time for the racquets strung with the hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we sum the times for all the racquets:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is:
\[ 227 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones John buys for him, his 2 kids, and his wife, given that each phone after the first two is half price.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. Each subsequent phone costs half of $600, which is $300.

John needs to buy 4 phones in total:
- 1st phone: $600
- 2nd phone: $600
- 3rd phone: $300
- 4th phone: $300

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300

Let's calculate the total cost:
- Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 13 + 20 = 33 players.

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many wooden slats are required. Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of slats \( S \) required is:

\[
S = 2 \times P
\]

Substituting the perimeter \( P \):

\[
S = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Thus, Robert will need:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:

12 boxes

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:

2 boxes to her mom + 2 boxes to her sister = 4 boxes

Now, we subtract the boxes given away from the total:

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:

1/4 of 12 boxes = 3 boxes

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:

8 boxes - 3 boxes = 5 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

5 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 100 oranges

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 100 oranges."
"To solve this, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S_{USA} \). Therefore, \( S_{USA} = 50 \).

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in India as \( S_{India} \). According to the problem, \( S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} S_{USA} + 4 \).

Substituting the value of \( S_{USA} \):

\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:

\[ S_{India} + S_{USA} = 29 + 50 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, I will calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's start by determining the number of cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can calculate Richard's cherries as follows:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Thus, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, I will first determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

Let's start with the gingerbread sales:
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate the apple pie sales:
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie.
- On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes.
- Total apple pie sold: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 26 boxes.

Now, we calculate the earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150.
- Earnings from apple pie: 26 boxes * $15/box = $390.

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: $150 (gingerbread) + $390 (apple pie) = $540.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we first need to calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over her vacation.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour and is outside for 4 hours each day. Therefore, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"To find the cost of the red car, we calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

Therefore, the price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car.

Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as \( D \) and the current age of his brother as \( B \).

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age difference between Emil and his dad. Since Emil is currently 19 and will be 24 when he turns 24, the age difference between them is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be:
\[ D + 5 \]

According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:
\[ 20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

"First, let's determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. We know that 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of shoe worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size five and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, we have the sizes of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots: 25 and 5, respectively. To find the average size, we add these sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to match the units of the flower growth. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the flower bed is:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower grows to 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Converting 1.5 feet to inches:

\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

So, each plant, including the space between them, takes up:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed. We divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants} \]

Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can plant 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many, so:

\[ \text{Brother's daily pretzel intake} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will incur, we first need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- Petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- Sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

Total cost for one basket:
$9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
$14.00 * 5 = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is $70.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is:
- \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:
- \(3\) roses.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her monthly savings, we divide her monthly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year).

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and saute 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can peel and saute simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated, which is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
- For 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on high for 4 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
- For 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was off for 2 hours:
- The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
- For 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Cooling due to low setting: -6 degrees
- Cooling due to high setting: -12 degrees
- Warming due to no air conditioner: +4 degrees

The net change in temperature is:
\[
-6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age difference between Bill's father and Bill when Bill saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- Bill's father was 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.
- The age difference between Bill and his father is \(90 - 30 = 60\) years.

Since Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's father saw the comet for the first time 30 years ago. Therefore, Bill must have been 60 years old 30 years ago when he saw the comet for the second time. This means Bill was 60 + 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the age difference between Bill and his father is 60 years, Bill must have been 90 - 60 = 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
30"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we will calculate the number of checks he writes for each category and then sum them up.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \), and the number of flights to France and Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \) each.

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France. Since the remaining flights after the flights to Greece are split equally between flights to France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \). Substituting \( F = 88 \) into this equation, we get:

\[
\text{Number of flights to France} = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we will first calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds.
   - \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls.
   - Combined duration: \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) = \( 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves' howls.
   - Total duration: \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) + \( 60 \) seconds (Igneous) = \( 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert the Total Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - \( 120 \) seconds divided by \( 60 \) seconds per minute = \( 2 \) minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total amount he needed minus the money given by his parents, which is $30 - $18 = $12.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the average age of the group by \(A_{avg}\). The total age of the children is given by:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group. The average age \(A_{avg}\) is:
\[ A_{avg} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]
Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the contribution from Walter's lawyer, we need to first calculate the total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

The total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected by Walter from his neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cookies and then figure out how many people received 15 cookies each.

First, calculate the total number of cookies:
- There were 100 guests.
- Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\).

Next, the bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door:
- Half of 1500 cookies is \(1500 / 2 = 750\).

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people received these cookies, we divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:
- \(750 / 15 = 50\).

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on the clinic rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is scheduled to work 9 hours at the clinic. Therefore, the time he will have left to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Since Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the total time required from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time.

5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, and Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes. Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars.

The total number of chocolate bars sold can be expressed as:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \( 8 \)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, as well as the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the cost per session:
- Fixed cost of renting the studio: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, and assuming a month has 4 weeks, the number of sessions per month is:
- Sessions per week: 3
- Weeks per month: 4
- Total sessions per month: 3 * 4 = 12

Finally, we calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total sessions per month: 12
- Total earnings per month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[
4p = 64
\]
\[
7m = 56
\]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[
4p = 64
\]
\[
p = \frac{64}{4}
\]
\[
p = 16
\]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[
7m = 56
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7}
\]
\[
m = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the original population plus the number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool in cubic feet, then convert that volume to gallons, and finally calculate the cost based on the given rate.

The volume of the pool in cubic feet is calculated by multiplying the width, length, and depth:
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \text{ ft} \times 25 \text{ ft} \times 4 \text{ ft} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \times 7.48 \text{ gallons/cubic foot} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1047.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks.

Next, we calculate the number of blue sticks. According to the problem, there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the number of yellow sticks. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[ 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by Matteo. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, we calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, we sum up the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ x \times 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.658 \times 0.817} \]
\[ x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.536} \]
\[ x \approx 0.522 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.2%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10000.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, and she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = \$25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2000}{\$1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits, he has:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. She bought a box containing 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept two packs for herself. The number of pieces in these two packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Subtracting the pieces Anne kept from the total, we find out how many pieces she gave to her friends:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, given an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Growth Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to Facebook. 

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures. She divided these pictures into 8 albums. 

Let's denote the number of selfies as \( S \) and the number of portraits as \( P \). 

Given:
- The total number of pictures is 72.
- The total number of albums is 8.
- 3 albums are for selfies only.
- 2 albums are for portraits only.

Since the total number of albums is 8, and 3 are for selfies and 2 are for portraits, the remaining albums must be for other categories. 

Let's denote the number of albums for other categories as \( A \). Therefore:
\[ 3 \text{ (selfies)} + 2 \text{ (portraits)} + A = 8 \]
\[ 5 + A = 8 \]
\[ A = 3 \]

So, there are 3 albums for other categories.

Now, we need to find the number of selfies and portraits. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and the albums are divided into selfies, portraits, and other categories, we can set up the following equations:
\[ S + P + \text{other pictures} = 72 \]

Since the selfies and portraits are already accounted for in the albums, the remaining pictures are in the other albums. Let's denote the number of pictures in the other albums as \( O \). Therefore:
\[ S + P + O = 72 \]

Given that the selfies and portraits are in the albums, we can assume that the other albums contain the remaining pictures. 

Since the selfies and portraits are in the albums, we can use the fact that the total number of pictures in the albums is 72. We know the number of selfies and portraits in their respective albums, but we need to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Since the selfies and portraits are in the albums, we can use the fact that the total number of pictures in the albums is 72. We know the number of selfies and portraits in their respective albums, but we need to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

1. **Early Checkouts:**
   - 24 guests elected to check out early.
   - Guests remaining: \( 100 - 24 = 76 \)

2. **Late Checkouts:**
   - 15 guests elected to check out late.
   - Guests remaining: \( 76 - 15 = 61 \)

3. **Guests Checking In:**
   - Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of guests who checked in: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \)
   - Guests now: \( 61 + 30 = 91 \)

4. **Additional Guests:**
   - 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.
   - Guests now: \( 91 + 7 = 98 \)

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John picks, we will calculate the number of bananas he picks each day and then sum them up.

First, on Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
\[ \text{Bananas on Wednesday} = 4 \]

Next, on Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
\[ \text{Bananas on Thursday} = 6 \]

On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks:
\[ \text{Bananas on Friday} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the bananas picked over the three days:
\[ \text{Total bananas} = \text{Bananas on Wednesday} + \text{Bananas on Thursday} + \text{Bananas on Friday} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of bananas John has is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of easy questions:**
   - Total questions: 60
   - Easy questions: 40% of 60
   \[
   \text{Easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24

Thus, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = $4 \) and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( 2x \) (since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we first need to find out how many sandwiches are eaten per day by the entire family, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week is:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Thus, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Suzanne has left from her earnings is:

"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since there were 100 eggs hidden in total, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. Thus, the friends found 30 eggs."
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - A month has 30 days.
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \( 18 \times 30 = 540 \) pounds of ore in a month.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 40 dwarves.
   - The total ore mined by 40 dwarves is \( 40 \times 540 = 21600 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to establish the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price.

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( P \).

We know the following prices and quantities:
- 2 sandwiches for $3
- 4 sandwiches for $6
- 8 sandwiches for \( P \)

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:
- For the first package (2 sandwiches for $3):
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package (4 sandwiches for $6):
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich remains the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
P = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios that prevent him from having to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 100% or 1.00
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 1.00 = 0.50\) or 50%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\) or 20%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.12\) or 12%

Now, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.12 = 0.82 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.82 = 0.18 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.18 \times 100 = 18\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 18%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This is the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center minus the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

Total reserved seats = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty
Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250 seats

Now, we subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find out the number of tickets that can be distributed to the graduates and their guests.

Tickets available for distribution = Total capacity - Total reserved seats
Tickets available for distribution = 6000 - 1250 = 4750 tickets

Since the tickets are to be split equally among the graduates, we need to divide the available tickets by the number of graduates.

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Tickets available for distribution / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950

Now, we perform the division:

4750 / 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next, dropping the candy in each time. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 7 times, the total number of trips he will make is 7.

Each trip takes 5 seconds, so the total time required is:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During his college years, Jim would have earned $0 because he was in school.
- Therefore, the total income during his college years = $0.

Finally, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college and not worked during his college years:
- Total income if he had not gone to college and not worked = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had gone to college:
- Total income if he had gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000 (income from his job) + $200,000 (loan repayment) = $300,000.

The difference in income between going to college and not going to college is:
- Difference in income = $300,000 (if he went to college) - $100,000 (if he had not gone to college) = $200,000.

To find out how long it would take to earn the $200,000, we need to know Jim's current income. Since he has a $25,000 a year job, we can calculate the time it would take to earn $200,000 at this rate:
- Time to earn $200,000 = $200,000 / $25,000 = 8 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.

Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \) feet
- Width: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."

\[
\text{Letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
\]

Calculate \(\frac{1}{5} \times 425\):

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Then add 17:

\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 102.

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.

\[
\text{Letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5
\]

Calculate \(2 \times 102\):

\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then add 5:

\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 209.

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

\[
\text{Total letters} = 425 + 102 + 209
\]

Add these numbers step by step:

\[
425 + 102 = 527
\]

\[
527 + 209 = 736
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

\[
\boxed{736}

"To calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then sum them up.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

First, let's summarize the details of each race:
- On the first race, Johnny lost $5.
- On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. Therefore, he won $11 in the second race.
- On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. Therefore, he lost $16.50 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.50

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.50 = $21.50

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
Average amount lost per race = $21.50 / 3 = $7.16666667

Rounding to the nearest cent, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}
\]"
"To find the total population of South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 = 130000 \]

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert the heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Xavier's height was 4 feet, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches, so his new height is:

\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:

\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, we need to determine the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours they worked. Since they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day, the total hours worked over 21 days is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days of work} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. Since there are 4 painters, the total hours of work divided by the number of painters gives us the hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ days of work per painter} \]

To convert this into hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
\[ 1.96875 \times 24 = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need to combine the terms involving \( x \). To do this, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can determine the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means that each year the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = \$20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \]

We can simplify the calculation by recognizing that:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.624189 \]

Therefore:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.624189 = 12483.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately \( \$12483.78 \)."
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 German books.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego, California and New York City, New York.

The total distance is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has driven 325 kilometers.

\[ 1955 - 325 = 1630 \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days, and then convert that into gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups into gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

Thus, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \$2400."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find the increased cost, we calculate 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

60% of $120 is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
  \]

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
\[
2 \text{ loads (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ load (king size bed)} = 3 \text{ loads}
\]

Since Greg does this every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
\[
52 \text{ weeks in a year}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of loads Greg does in a year:
\[
3 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 156 \text{ loads/year}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{156}

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

So, in one weekend, they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so his collection increased to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Therefore, his collection increased to 150 + 100 = 250 stickers. 

The final numerical answer is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day. Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams per cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and we know Becky ate 10 slices. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate together:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate how many emails he responds to in a single day.

James gets 80 emails a day. 20% of these emails do not require any response. Therefore, 80% of the emails require a response.

To find the number of emails that require a response, we calculate 80% of 80:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day.

In a 5-day work week, the total number of emails he responds to is:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes visited.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes visited.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones, and he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional ones is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after departure, a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. The number of trucks that failed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

The total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing the butter, we first need to calculate the total amount of butter he needs. Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Therefore, he needs:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, we need to consider the promotion at the grocery store, which is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for one pound at the full price. 

To find out how many pounds of butter Dennis will need to buy to get 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we can use the following logic:

- For the first pound, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the second pound, Dennis pays half the price, which is $2.00.
- For the third pound, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, Dennis pays half the price, which is $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, Dennis pays the full price of $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, Dennis pays half the price, which is $2.00.

So, Dennis will pay for 3 full pounds at $4.00 each and 3 half-priced pounds at $2.00 each. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} + 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 + \$6.00 = \$18.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest beyond 20. Therefore, the additional guests are:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests to get the total cost:

- Total cost = $125 (base rental fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251.

Thus, the total cost for Kayla's party is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 each. Therefore, \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is 85."
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. Therefore, the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He then finished another 500-piece puzzle, placing another 500 pieces. Therefore, during that hour, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, Jenny needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. She will use the $25 she has to pay for the roses and will be left with $5 in change. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive in her change.

Since $5 is equivalent to 20 quarters (because $1 = 4 quarters, and $5 = 5 \times 4 = 20 quarters), Jenny will receive 20 quarters in change.

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes sold: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total earnings from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters sold: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total earnings from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas sold: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total earnings from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum up the earnings from all items:
- Total earnings: \( 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \) dollars

Therefore, Terry makes a total of 162 dollars."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the duration of Paul's wait.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs.
   - Arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes (a quarter of the first train's stay time).
   - Departure time: 60 + 20 = 80 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs.
   - Arrives at 80 + 60 = 140 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 140 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs.
   - Arrives at 140 + 20 = 160 minutes.
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we calculate the time Paul needs to wait for his train:
- Paul arrives at the station at 160 minutes.
- The fourth train arrives at 160 minutes.

Since Paul arrives at the station at the same time the fourth train arrives, he does not need to wait at all.

Therefore, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 0 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

Next, Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch from him at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid. So, we calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

Now, we need to find out the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend received. The original price of the watch was $2000, and he paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
\]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second.

First, let's calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
- Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, in one hour, one spring will create \(3600\) jellyfish.

Next, let's calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:
- In 4 hours, one spring will create \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) jellyfish.

Now, let's calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:
- If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"To find Frankie's score, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( F \) be Frankie's score and \( B \) be Binkie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score \( B \) is 90, and Frankie's score \( F \) is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be written as:

\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"Let's break down the journey:

1. James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. The total distance he walks is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.
4. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took him to reach the store, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the time it took him to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the bananas if Jenny bought them individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bananas if Jenny bought them in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we note that he already has 20 feet, and the question asks for the amount left over, which is 0 feet since he has exactly what he is supposed to have.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \]"
"To determine the growth rate of the crocodile per year, we divide the total growth by the total time period:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To determine Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:

1. **Trekking bikes:**
   - Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Total bikes sold = 300
   - Number of Trekking bikes sold = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)

2. **BMX bikes:**
   - 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes sold = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)

3. **MTB bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Number of Trekking bikes sold - Number of BMX bikes sold
   - Number of MTB bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = Half the price of an MTB bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)

3. **Earnings from MTB bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500
   - Earnings from MTB bikes = \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find Marcel's total earnings for the month:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 32500 = 111250
\]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply that by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Therefore, the net number of bales of hay added to the field each hour is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

Since they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay added to the field is:

\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:

\[ 12 \text{ bales} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day, so he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week, so he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the time spent on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600, so he spends \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday each.

5. **Calculate the total time spent learning each week:**
   - The total time spent in class each week is 1600 minutes.
   - The total time spent on Saturday and Sunday is 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, \(1700\) minutes is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = 28.3333\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is \(28.3333\) hours."
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces back to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, the height of the ball after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the ball on its second bounce will be \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height after the first bounce:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height of the ball on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we first need to calculate the number of bags sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

Thus, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"To calculate the cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of days Billy works in the given period.

March has 31 days. April 19th is 19 days into April. Therefore, the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

Therefore, the number of days he works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he can help in one day is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Thus, the total number of people he helps in 40 days is 40 * 6 = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is 240."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two quantities.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

Finally, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church.

Let's perform the calculations:

\[
12 \times 35 = 420
\]

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

\[
420 + 60 = 480

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is 480."
"To find Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Martha's age:**
   - Mike is 24 years old.
   - Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
   - Therefore, Martha's age is \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) years.

2. **Determine Jeff's age:**
   - Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   - Since Martha is 20 years old, Jeff's age is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) years.

Thus, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of descent: 60 feet/minute

Time to ride the biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of descent: 80 feet/minute

Time to ride the second biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"To calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we first need to determine the daily total and then multiply by the number of days.

Bobby's daily break time is 30 minutes for lunch plus 2 times 15 minutes for breaks, which is 30 + 2*15 = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.

So, Bobby spends 60 minutes per day on his lunches and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent is 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.

Thus, the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days is 5 hours."
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate the total miles run by Amber and Micah.

Amber ran 8 miles.

Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so:
\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles run by Amber and Micah:
\[ \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Since the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.
5. Add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.
6. The final balance will be the sum of the remaining balance and the costs of the frying pan and towels.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of the frying pan after 20% discount: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels after 10% discount: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Adding the frying pan and towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can say that the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Among these large jellyfish, a third change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

According to the problem, when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To find Caroline's age, we first need to determine Ben's age and then use that to find Caroline's age.

Given:
- Chris is 4 years old.
- Ben is two times older than Chris.

First, calculate Ben's age:
\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we know that Caroline is three times older than Ben:
\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and the percentage of her salary she plans to live on in retirement.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much she will need to save for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement:
- Her retirement salary will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \) dollars per year.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years of retirement:
- The total amount needed for 20 years of retirement is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

Since Lauren saves $20,000 each year, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work to save $800,000:
- The number of years required is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts that Marty cuts from the 100 centimeters of ribbon. We then need to find the length of each of the 5 equal parts that will be cut from each of these 4 parts.

First, we calculate the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[
\text{Length of each of the 4 equal parts} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
\]

Next, we need to find the length of each of the 5 equal parts that will be cut from each of these 25 cm parts:
\[
\text{Length of each of the 5 equal parts} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
\]

Thus, the length of each final cut will be:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ cm}}
\]"
"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \). Therefore, 40% of \( N \) is equal to 240 boys. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

\[ N = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To calculate the total amount spent by my mom at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil, and then subtract the coupon discount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
The coupon discount is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the coupon discount from the total:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the mean of the heights of the heels worn by the women at the party.

Given:
- Three women are wearing 4 inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2 inch heels.

The total height of the heels can be calculated as follows:
- For the 4 inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- For the 2 inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

The total height of all heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

The total number of heels is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

The average height of the heels is calculated by dividing the total height of the heels by the total number of heels:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in June and then the number of miles she plans to hike in June.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She intends to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of days in June:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

Now, we determine the total number of miles she plans to hike in June:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since she needs to hike 9,300 miles and plans to hike 7,500 miles, the number of additional miles she needs to hike per day is:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To calculate the total amount the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to multiply the number of each color of ball by its respective cost and then sum these amounts.

For the red balls:
3 red balls * $9 per red ball = $27

For the blue balls:
11 blue balls * $5 per blue ball = $55

For the green balls:
25 green balls * $3 per green ball = $75

Now, we add these amounts together:
$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Pierre, Paul, and Paul (likely a typo, should be Paul) want in terms of kilograms of apples, and then subtract that from the total amount of apples they bought.

First, let's calculate how much Paul wants. Paul wants 1/3 of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, let's calculate how much Pierre wants. Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, let's add up the amounts that Pierre and Paul want:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount that Pierre and Paul want from the original 12 kg to find out how many kilograms James will have left:
\[
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature dropped by 8 degrees Celsius, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. Then it increased by 3 degrees Celsius, so the temperature became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius. 

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we can follow these steps:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He saved $11 from his allowance, so we add this to his initial amount: $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He then spent $5 on a comic book, so we subtract this from his current amount: $32 - $5 = $27.
4. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract this from his current amount: $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each book cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases.
2. Calculate the total amount spent on the books.
3. Divide the total amount spent on the books by the number of books bought.

First, Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

She has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year's enrollment was 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as follows:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. Adding this increase to last year's enrollment gives us the current enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fishes Tate has after his purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fishes, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
   - Let's denote Dior's time as \( D \) hours, where \( D > 8 \).

Now, we need to calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

Substituting the known times:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 + 6 + D
\]

Since \( D > 8 \), the minimum value for \( D \) is 9 hours. Therefore, the minimum total time is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

\[
\boxed{19}

"To determine the total miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time in hours:**
   John drives for 2 hours to visit his parents.

2. **Calculate the round trip driving time in hours:**
   Since the round trip involves driving to his parents and back, the total time for the round trip is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (one way)} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours (round trip)}
   \]

3. **Determine the speed of the car:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

4. **Calculate the total distance driven in the round trip:**
   Using the formula for distance, \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we find the distance for the round trip:
   \[
   \text{distance} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 280 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, John drives a total of 280 miles each month when visiting his parents."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk a total of \(10 \times 7 = 70\) miles.

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. Thus, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's add the production rates of all four workers:
- The total production rate of the four workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the four workers in that time is:
- \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
- \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

However, we calculated that the four workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the remaining:
- \(400 - 20 - 200 = 180\) toys.

Since the fifth worker works for a 10-hour shift, the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour is:
- \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs} = 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he kept, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \).

Solving for \( S \):
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms he has in total:

- An ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms.
- With 30 ounces, the total number of M&Ms is \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&Ms.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag:

- If each small bag contains 10 M&Ms, the number of small bags he can make is \(900 \div 10 = 90\) small bags.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we first need to determine the speed of the second fastest car, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given:
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
- The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.

First, calculate the speed of the second fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the average car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, calculate the speed of the fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of each box (which contains 8 crayons and weighs 8 ounces) is:

\[ \text{Total weight of each box} = 8 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 8 \text{ ounces (box)} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of all the boxes and crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 16 \text{ ounces/box} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling these planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the monthly earnings of Valerie's brother and their mother.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns twice that amount:
\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate their mother's earnings, which is twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the monthly earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ \text{Total monthly earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ 45000 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, the time spent on the beach is given by:
\[ \text{Time on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{2}{v} \text{ minutes} \]
We are given that this time is 40 minutes:
\[ \frac{2}{v} = 40 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we know that Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]
Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can add up the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Adding these together: \(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees. 

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, and then he pours 1 ounce from the other mug. After these actions, the water in the water bottle is drinkable, meaning it must be at least 40 degrees.

The initial amount of water in the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and after pouring 4 ounces into the water bottle, the remaining amount of water in the 33-degree mug is 0 ounces. Therefore, the water in the water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces at 33 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the water bottle from the second mug as \( T \) degrees. After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the remaining amount of water in the second mug is \( T - 1 \) ounces. The water in the water bottle from the second mug is 1 ounce at \( T \) degrees.

The average temperature of the water in the water bottle after these actions is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). Therefore, the average temperature of the water in the water bottle is:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

68"
"To solve this problem, I will calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add this to the initial number of animals.

Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens, which totals to 70 animals.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in three weeks (21 days), they bring 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Adding the animals brought in over the three weeks to the initial number of animals, we get:

Initial animals: 70
Cows added: 420
Chickens added: 210

Total animals after three weeks: 70 + 420 + 210 = 700

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. With a 10% discount, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is the total discounted cost divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we calculate 3 less than 6:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means that for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, we need to find out how many potatoes are required. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops will require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over the 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans. We know that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can now calculate the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - 17 - 34 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

   \text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ lemons}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years in a decade:**
   A decade is 10 years.

5. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade:**
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons per year} \times \text{Number of years in a decade} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lemons}
   \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the bouquet sales. Since each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet as follows:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers per bouquet} = 12 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets Faraday sold per day. Since he earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, we know that Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers sold per day. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflowers is:

\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from sunflowers} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is:

\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 84 + 13 = 97 \]

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[ \text{Total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 291 \]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue if Adam sells all 20 rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$140
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue if Adam only sells 60% of his inventory:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$84
   \]

4. **Calculate the loss:**
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = \$140 - \$84 = \$56
   \]

Therefore, Adam loses \(\boxed{56}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of days required to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of days required to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

Finally, we calculate the number of days required to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
  \]

To find the total number of days required to complete all the picture scenes, we sum the days for each type:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the probabilities for each ticket:
- The probability that the first ticket is a winner is \( P_1 = 0.20 \).
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket is a winner is \( P_2 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12. \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%. \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \), which simplifies to \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \), which simplifies to \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. Therefore, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding this to the original 5 minutes:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To determine Linus's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of each mobile device. Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Linus bought 2 mobile devices last Monday and 4 mobile devices last Tuesday, so the total number of mobile devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total revenue from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the mobile devices. Linus bought 2 devices for $20 each and 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of Carl and then use that information to find the length of his cane.

First, we know Isabel's height:
\[ \text{Isabel's height} = 7 \text{ feet} \]

Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel:
\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is one foot taller than Ned:
\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall:
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current daily production from the total number of bottles required.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed. Each bottle of juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \]

This is because 100% is equivalent to 5 bottles per person (since 20% is 1 bottle per person).

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles are required. Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. Therefore, the additional bottles needed are:

\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue, and then calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

Therefore, the number of tax reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of land sold:**
   - Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land.
   - He sold half of it, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After a month, he sold another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his remaining land, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) square meters.
   - Therefore, the total area sold is \( 40 + 10 = 50 \) square meters.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the first sale:**
   - He sold 40 square meters for $50.
   - Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \times 50 = 2000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the revenue from the second sale:**
   - He sold 10 square meters for $30.
   - Revenue from the second sale: \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the remaining land and its value:**
   - The total area sold is 50 square meters, so the remaining land is \( 80 - 50 = 30 \) square meters.
   - He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   - Revenue from the remaining land: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue is the sum of the revenues from all sales.
   - Total revenue: \( 2000 + 300 + 90 = 2390 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \( 2390 \) dollars."

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day. Since he changes his mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:

\[ \text{Daily usage} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ masks per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days. Since he uses 6 masks per day, in 2 days he will use:

\[ \text{Usage in 2 days} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs that Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week and then determine his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
  \[
  200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
  \]

Next, we need to determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- The combined number of apartments in the first two complexes is 400.
- 60% of 400 is:
  \[
  0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}
  \]
- Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
  \[
  400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week:
- He collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex.
- The total number of apartments he collects from the first two complexes in a week is:
  \[
  3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ apartments}
  \]
- The total number of apartments he collects from the third complex in a week is:
  \[
  3 \times 640 = 1920 \text{ apartments}
  \]
- Therefore, the total number of apartments he collects from all complexes in a week is:
  \[
  1200 + 1920 = 3120 \text{ apartments}
  \]

Finally, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment:
- His weekly earnings are:
  \[
  3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1248}

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

\[
\boxed{2350}

"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20. 

Therefore, Jack now has $100 + $20 = $120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]
\[ R = 4Y - 28 \]

Now, we substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, so we have:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Ronnie received $5, so the total amount of money Rissa had initially was $15. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( 4/5 \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

From this, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can write:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms and the living room, and then add the area of the rest of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms and the living room to find the total area of the bedrooms and the living room:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms and living room} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} = 2160 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 2160 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we will calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 2 * Monday's count = 2 * 3 = 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 2 * Tuesday's count = 2 * 6 = 12 puffs
- Thursday: 2 * Wednesday's count = 2 * 12 = 24 puffs
- Friday: 2 * Thursday's count = 2 * 24 = 48 puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48

Let's add these numbers step by step:
3 + 6 = 9
9 + 12 = 21
21 + 24 = 45
45 + 48 = 93

Therefore, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box contains 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, which means the price per pod is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, we can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas loses 10 bills on the way home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill. The number of $20 bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

The remaining number of $20 bills is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

The total amount of money Thomas has left is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thomas then triples his money, so the new total amount of money is:

\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, and he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can calculate the amount of chalk used as follows:

\[ \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the amount of chalk remaining after Monday is:

\[ \text{Chalk remaining after Monday} = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it. We will calculate the amount of chalk used each day and subtract it from the remaining chalk until it is less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the amount of chalk used on day \( n \) as \( 0.2 \times \text{remaining chalk from the previous day} \).

On the second day, the teacher will use:

\[ \text{Chalk used on day 2} = 0.2 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

The remaining chalk after the second day is:

\[ \text{Chalk remaining after day 2} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]

On the third day, the teacher will use:

\[ \text{Chalk used on day 3} = 0.2 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \text{ inches} \]

The remaining chalk after the third day is:

\[ \text{Chalk remaining after day 3} = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

On the fourth day, the teacher will use:

\[ \text{Chalk used on day 4} = 0.2 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches} \]

The remaining chalk after the fourth day is:

\[ \text{Chalk remaining after day 4} = 1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches} \]

On the fifth day, the teacher will use:

\[ \text{Chalk used on day 5} = 0.2 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students who are on varsity and then subtract that number from the total number of students in Miss Albert's class.

First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students on varsity} = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike bought 5 face masks.
2. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we can calculate it as follows:

- Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- Johnny bought 2 more than this amount, so he bought \(15 + 2 = 17\) face masks.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 17."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 teeth. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"To determine the refund amount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of the milk is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. The amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Thus, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the first equation to find \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we can find out how many books each school gets by dividing the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ 1800 \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up these two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Newton picked up these 5 apples and put 4 in his pocket, leaving one apple on the ground.
3. Newton picked up the remaining apple and threw it at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Newton picked up these 6 apples and put all of them in his pocket.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton brought home:

- From the first incident, he had 2 apples.
- From the second incident, he had 4 apples.
- From the third incident, he had 6 apples.

Adding these up: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples."
"First, we need to determine the number of 50 kg bags required to fulfill the order of 850 kg of coal. 

To do this, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times \$18 \text{ per bag} = \$306 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the cheese pizza = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the pepperoni pizza = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Next, we determine how many whole pizzas are needed for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = Total slices eaten / Slices per pizza = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = Total slices eaten / Slices per pizza = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we can add the miles he ran on each day:

- Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 miles each day, so 3 * 3 = 9 miles.
- Tuesday and Thursday: 5 miles each day, so 5 * 2 = 10 miles.

Adding these together: 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

Therefore, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, then 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. At that time, Jim was half of John's age, so Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old. 

Since 20 years have passed, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old. 

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which means her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add up the slices each of them ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - At the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there is a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered on the third day:

- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages left from the order.
- Adding the bandages they had at the end of the second day, they had \(22 + 75 = 97\) bandages, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left.

Given the discrepancy, let's assume the bandages they had at the end of the second day were 78 instead of 22. This means they used \(100 - 78 = 22\) bandages on the third day, which is consistent with the half pack they used.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 50.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the color cost and the haircut cost.

The color cost is $40.

The haircut cost is $30 per inch. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means it was cut by 2 inches. Therefore, the haircut cost is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding the color cost and the haircut cost together, we get $40 + $60 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost for May's hair cut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the month of April:

1. Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
2. She works 6 days a week.
3. There are 4 weeks in April.

So, the total number of hours she works in April is:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay for the month is:
\[ 180 \, \text{hours} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/hour} = 270 \, \text{\$} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences for the month of April, she receives the additional $10 attendance bonus.

Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ 270 \, \text{\$} + 10 \, \text{\$} = 280 \, \text{\$} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"To calculate Jason's earnings, we need to sum up the earnings from each task he completed in the two-week period.

1. Earnings from doing laundry: $3.00
2. Earnings from cleaning his room: $1.50
3. Earnings from taking the trash out: $0.75 per trip, and he took the trash out twice, so $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
4. Earnings from emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we sum these amounts:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the two-week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in a single shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks. If one shark has 120 gallons of blood, then ten sharks will have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]

"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to sum the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice this number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum all these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

Thus, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we will break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate the number of trees planted each day.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was consumed and then subtract that from the initial amount.

1. **Initial amount of root beer:** 24 gallons.
2. **After the children drank 4 gallons:** 
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **After Barbie spilled 7 gallons:**
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
\]

To express this as a decimal:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 66 fish in the tank.

One-third of the fish have red stripes. Therefore, the number of fish with red stripes is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:
\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Out of these remaining 44 fish, 5/11 have blue stripes. Therefore, the number of fish with blue stripes is:
\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes. We already know there are 22 fish with red stripes and 20 fish with blue stripes. Therefore, the total number of fish with red or blue stripes is:
\[
22 + 20 = 42

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. Therefore, Amy loses four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set contains six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

Therefore, Amy uses up three colors from the makeup set. So, the number of colors left after using up half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of Mattison's house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories high, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor} = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the distance the last dog needs to walk as \(x\) miles.

The total distance walked by all dogs per day is the sum of the distances each dog needs to walk. This can be expressed as:
\[1 + 4 + 3 + x\]

We know that the average distance walked per dog is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total distance walked by all dogs per day is:
\[4 \times 3 = 12\]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[8 + x = 12\]

Solving for \(x\), we subtract 8 from both sides:

"To determine how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount John gets.
2. Determine how much of the loan amount he uses to pay off his debts.
3. Calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

First, we calculate the loan amount John gets. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, we determine how much of the loan amount he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts:

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts:

\[
\text{Leftover amount} = \text{Loan amount} - \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Given that she sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

Given that the cost price is $72, we can calculate the profit:

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day at each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 1 liter
   - Duration: 3 days
   - Total water removed at low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \)

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Water removed per day: \( 2 \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 2 \text{ liters/day} \)
   - Duration: 3 days
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \)

3. **High setting:**
   - Water removed per day: \( 2 \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 4 \text{ liters/day} \)
   - Duration: 5 days
   - Total water removed at high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \)

Now, we sum the total water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is \( 29 \) liters."

"First, let's determine the total amount of medicine in one dose.

The first medicine is 14 mL.
The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, which is \( 3 \times 14 \) mL.

Let's calculate the amount of the second medicine:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:
\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ 448 \text{ mL} \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\boxed{150}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest, and then determine how much he will pay each month and the remaining amount for the twelfth month.

First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest:
- The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300.
- The interest is 2% of $300, which is \( 0.02 \times 300 = 6 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount Stephen will owe is \( 300 + 6 = 306 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay each month for 11 months and the remaining amount for the twelfth month. Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in the first 11 months is:
\[ 11 \times 25 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is the total amount Stephen owes minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for two children, the total number of diaper changes per day is 5 * 2 = 10 diaper changes. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, which means she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the jar, the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar, and then determine how many of those jelly beans are red.

First, calculate the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar, considering the packing efficiency:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume of the jar}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} \times \text{Efficiency} = \frac{540}{.15} \times 0.8 = 3600 \times 0.8 = 2880 \]

Now, calculate the number of red jelly beans:
\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.3 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. Therefore, the difference between the estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number is:
\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off in his guess."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered the bus at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers on the bus after the first stop**: 20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60 people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered the bus at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop**: 60 (after first stop) + 30 (second stop) = 90 people.
6. **Number of passengers on the bus after the third stop**: The number of passengers doubled = 90 \(\times\) 2 = 180 people.
7. **Bus capacity**: 200 people.
8. **Remaining capacity on the bus**: 200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of passengers) = 20 people.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the total cost of her visits over the 8 years.

First, we calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it has increased by 150%. The increase in cost is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times \frac{150}{100} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ \text{New cost} = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of visits over the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, the total cost for one year is:

\[ \text{Cost per year} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 5 years is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 5 years} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit remains at $5, so the total cost for these 3 years is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 3 years} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for all 8 years:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

First, we find the total number of students in the school who are eligible to try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each grade and there are three grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 30 students. Since each group consists of 8 students, the number of groups required is:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 3.75 \right\rceil = 4 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for Ali:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:

\[ x = 8 \]

So the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \) feet.

The length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of meat needed:**
   Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the amount of meat required as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning required is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Amount of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke should buy, we first need to calculate the total width of all the windows combined. There are five windows, each 35 inches wide. Therefore, the total width of the windows is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Thus, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute. Therefore, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for the 36-minute call:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for a 36-minute call is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the amount of rain expected on Tuesday, we first need to calculate twice the amount of rain that fell on Monday, and then add one more inch to that amount.

Given that it rained 2 inches on Monday, we can calculate the expected rain for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Rain on Monday} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 2 \times 2 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 4 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 5 \]

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]
since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats.

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify this by calculating the number of brownies:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure.
2. Apply the 20% discount for getting both services.
3. Add the cost of nail art to the discounted total.

First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these costs together:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Discounted total} = 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each):
\[ \text{Cost of nail art} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of:

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since Susan receives 66 issues in total, and each issue is from a different magazine, she gets 66 magazines every year. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation to solve for \( K \):

\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, I will calculate the price step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:** $40

2. **Price in December:** The price increased by 80%.
   - Increase amount = 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price in January:** The price decreased by 50%.
   - Decrease amount = 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for veteran lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
- Standard rate per lesson: $80
- Number of standard rate lessons: 4
- Total earnings from standard rate lessons: \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the 2 lessons with veterans:
- Reduced rate per lesson for veterans: 25% off the standard rate
- Reduced rate: \( 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \) dollars
- Number of veteran lessons: 2
- Total earnings from veteran lessons: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means Eve has 5 pomelos left. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Grapes Madeline ate**: 
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother**:
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother**:
   Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes remaining**:
   Let \( x \) be the total number of grapes at the beginning. After Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the remaining grapes are:
   \[
   x - 36
   \]

5. **Grapes used for pies**:

   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

6. **Setting up the equation**:
   The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their share must equal the grapes used for the pies:
   \[
   x - 36 = 48
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 48 + 36 = 84

"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we first need to calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients.

1. **Cost of pasta:**
   - Bud spends $1.00 on a box of pasta each week.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, Bud spends \( 2 \times 3.00 = 6.00 \) dollars on gruyere cheese each week.

4. **Total weekly cost:**
   - Summing up the costs of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
   \]

5. **Annual cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours, since the workday is measured in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this result is not physically possible as a percentage of a day cannot exceed 100%. This indicates that the custodian works more than one day to complete the task, which is consistent with the given information that they have 5 days to complete the cleaning. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 250\% \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we sum the capacities of all the shelves:
\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal 60 eggs.

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs.

To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since each set is sold for $1, the total earnings from selling all the eggs will be:

Total earnings = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost
Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey got 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the first equation to find \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into the steps he needs to follow.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for the people) + 16 (for the rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.
- Therefore, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:
- Total number of flashlights and candles = 20 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 56.

The final numerical answer is 56."

Thus, the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube is \(\boxed{30}\) minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, and Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, we can calculate the number of robots as follows:

\[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of helmets} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Similarly, Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs. Therefore, the number of footballs can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times \text{Number of helmets} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs:

\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of footballs} = 20 + 10 + 40 = 70 \]

Thus, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"First, we need to convert the total work hours into minutes, as the time taken per call is given in minutes. 

Tim works 6 hours each day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, the total number of minutes he works each day is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in a day. Given that it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, the number of calls he can handle in a day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

\]

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish."
"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we have accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. Therefore, the remaining number of plants is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ plants} \]

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water. Therefore, he will hop 100 yards and swim 100 yards.

The time taken to hop 100 yards at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time taken for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each additional phone. Given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone costs $20, we can calculate the cost of each additional phone as follows:

Cost of each additional phone = Cost of main phone / 2
Cost of each additional phone = $20 / 2
Cost of each additional phone = $10

Now, we know there are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones:

Total cost = Cost of main phone + (Cost of each additional phone * Number of additional phones)
Total cost = $20 + ($10 * 4)
Total cost = $20 + $40
Total cost = $60

Thus, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts made per day by the number of days in June:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the number of people Conor saw on the first day:
\[ \text{First day} = 50 \]

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day:
\[ \text{Second day} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day:
\[ \text{Third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day over the week was 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is:
\[ 5 \times 60 = 300 \]

The total number of people seen over the week can also be expressed as the sum of the people seen on each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 300 \]
\[ 260 + 3x = 300 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 300 - 260 \]
\[ 3x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \]

However, since the number of people must be a whole number, we can conclude that the value of \( x \) is indeed 13.33, but for the purpose of the total, we use the sum:
\[ 260 + 3 \times 13.33 = 260 + 40 = 300 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of popped kernels in each 30-second interval and then sum them up, including the additional popped kernels from residual heat.

1. **First 30 seconds:** 2 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** 3 times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds:** 4 times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 2 = 8\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum the kernels popped in the first three intervals:
\[2 + 6 + 8 = 16\]

In the final 30 seconds, 4 kernels pop. After the pan is removed from the heat, a quarter of these pop from residual heat:
\[\frac{4}{4} = 1\]

Adding the kernels popped from residual heat to the total:
\[16 + 1 = 17\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{17}

1. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - For each gallon, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \( 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - For 4 cups of lemon juice, he needs \( 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \).

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - The extra lemonade is twice as tart, meaning it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the extra lemonade will need \( 2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice.
   - For 2 cups of lemon juice, he needs \( 2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons} \).

4. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed:**
   - For the regular lemonade, he needs 24 lemons.
   - For the extra tart lemonade, he needs 12 lemons.
   - Therefore, the total number of lemons needed is \( 24 + 12 = 36 \).

The total number of lemons Tim will need is 36."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption of dog food for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds, each consuming 5 kilograms of dog food per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
\[ 3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/German Shepherd} = 15 \text{ kg/day} \]

The Kennel house also has 2 Bulldogs, each consuming 3 kilograms of dog food per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
\[ 2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/Bulldog} = 6 \text{ kg/day} \]

Adding the daily consumption of both breeds gives the total daily consumption of dog food:
\[ 15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \]

To find the total consumption for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we find the net distance from his starting point:
- The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."

- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

Pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)

Let's calculate the number of pink candies:
Pink candies = 232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the bus travels. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Now, we sum the costs for the hotel and the bus travels:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

Thus, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Dallas originally had 21 marbles, and after dropping 4, he has:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \text{ marbles} \]

Now, we know that Mazie started with 52 marbles and gave all of them to Dallas and Darla. Since Dallas ended up with 17 marbles, we can calculate the total number of marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles Mazie gave away:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \text{ marbles} \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to sum the cost of the tickets and the popcorns.

The cost of the adult tickets is:
2 adults * $12/adult = $24

The cost of the child ticket is:
1 child * $8/child = $8

The cost of the popcorns is:
2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

Therefore, the total amount they pay is $38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(2 \times 75 = 150\) pounds. Adding these together, the total weight is:

\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. Therefore, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

\[0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

Thus, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[\boxed{16}\]"
"To hang crepe-paper streamers along the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence, we need to calculate the total length of the fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (\( l \)) = 20 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 15 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (20 + 15) = 2 \times 35 = 70 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to hang along the perimeter of his backyard fence."
"To find the average of their ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

The average of their ages is calculated by adding their ages and dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
\]

Thus, the average of their ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

The total number of seashells found is:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[ 214 + 432 = 646 \]
\[ 646 + 86 = 732 \]

So, they found a total of 732 seashells. Out of these, 67 were cracked. Therefore, the number of good seashells is:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Dexter has five pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds per pig per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over a week (7 days), the total feed consumption is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the guests. Each of the 20 guests will eat 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party, so the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs John needs to buy is:

\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

For the cookies:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

Total revenue from cupcakes and cookies:
$40 + $40 = $80

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies.

Cost of one tray: $4
Cost of five trays: 5 * $4 = $20

Now, let's find out how much money Frances has left after her expenses.

Money left:
Total revenue - Total cost = $80 - $20 = $60

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. Therefore, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already distributed from the total number of meals she has planned to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals distributed from Friday to Sunday:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals distributed = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has distributed 142 meals.

Now, we subtract the total distributed meals from the total planned meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin into cents and then sum them up.

1. A quarter is worth 25 cents.
2. A nickel is worth 5 cents. Therefore, two nickels are worth \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.
3. A dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, seven dimes are worth \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, we sum these values:
\[
25 \text{ cents} + 10 \text{ cents} + 70 \text{ cents} = 105 \text{ cents}

"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

Given:
- The age of each sister is 16 years.
- There are 3 sisters, so the total age of the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.
- There are 2 brothers, so the total age of the brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.

Adding the total ages of the brothers and sisters together, we get:
\[48 + 36 = 84\]

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the time spent each day and then multiply by the number of days in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation in the morning: 15 minutes
- Meditation before sleep: 15 minutes
- Total meditation time per day: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each day:
- Yoga practice: 1 hour (60 minutes)

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga each day:
- Total daily practice time: 30 minutes (meditation) + 60 minutes (yoga) = 90 minutes

Since Charisma practices 5 days a week, we calculate the weekly practice time:
- Weekly practice time: 90 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 450 minutes/week

Finally, we calculate the total practice time over 4 weeks:
- Total practice time over 4 weeks: 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Total practice time over 4 weeks in hours: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To calculate the total square footage of the quilt, we need to multiply the number of each type of shirt by its respective square footage and then sum the results.

For the small t-shirts:
11 small shirts * 3 square feet per small shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium t-shirts:
8 medium shirts * 4 square feet per medium shirt = 32 square feet

For the large t-shirts:
6 large shirts * 6 square feet per large shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the square footage of all the shirts together:
33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"

1. Determine Anne's height.
2. Determine Jackie's height before summer.

First, we know that Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice the height of Albert, so Anne's height is:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is:
\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before summer was:
\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 67 \]"

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts and the original prices of the items he bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys two T-shirts and the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt is at full price and the second T-shirt is at half price.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is $40 * 0.40 = $16. Therefore, the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together, we get the total amount of money Jake spends:
$12 + $24 = $36.

Thus, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:

\[ \text{Ryan's allowance} = 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so a total of 4 ice cream cones:

\[ \text{Cost of ice cream cones} = 4 \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we first need to determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and finally determine the profit.

For one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 per jar = 10 * $50 = $500

Profit = Revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time and then determine how long it takes to fill them all.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug by the dog = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day at night. The net change in the number of holes per day is:
- Net change per day = 6 holes dug - 9 holes filled = -3 holes.

This means that every day, the number of holes decreases by 3. We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes.

Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes. The total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is:
\[ 9d \]

We set this equal to the total number of holes dug:
\[ 9d = 84 \]

Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = \frac{84}{9} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \]

Since \( d \) must be a whole number of days, we round up to the next whole number, which is 10 days. This means it takes 10 days to fill in all the holes.

To find out how many weeks this is, we divide the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.43 \]

Since we are asked for the number of weeks, we take the integer part of the division and round up if necessary. Thus, it takes 2 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws James has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws required for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs. 

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. 

\[
\boxed{30}

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the individual amounts raised by each girl and then sum them up.

First, we know that Alexandra raises $430. Let's denote the amount raised by Alexandra as \( A \). So, \( A = 430 \).

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Let's denote the amount raised by Kim as \( K \). Therefore, \( K = A + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750 \).

Next, we know that Sarah raises $300. Let's denote the amount raised by Sarah as \( S \). So, \( S = 300 \).

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Let's denote the amount raised by Maryam as \( M \). Therefore, \( M = S + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700 \).

Now, we can find the total amount of money raised by summing the amounts raised by Kim, Alexandra, Sarah, and Maryam:
\[ K + A + S + M = 750 + 430 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by the girls is \(\boxed{2180}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race.

First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's speeds and distances. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \(d_A\) miles and the distance Vanessa ran as \(d_V\) miles. According to the problem, \(d_V = 4\) miles.

Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, if we let Vanessa's speed be \(v_V\) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed \(v_A\) is \(2v_V\). The time it took Aaron to run his distance is given as 16 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation for Aaron's distance as:
\[ d_A = v_A \times 16 = 2v_V \times 16 = 32v_V \]

Since \(d_V = 4\) miles and \(d_V = v_V \times t_V\), where \(t_V\) is the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles, we have:
\[ 4 = v_V \times t_V \]
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{v_V} \]

Now, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since we know \(d_V = 4\) miles and \(d_V = v_V \times t_V\), we can directly use the relationship \(t_V = \frac{4}{v_V}\). However, we do not need to calculate \(v_V\) explicitly to find \(t_V\). We already have the relationship and the distance, so we can directly state the time Vanessa took:
\[ t_V = \frac{4}{v_V} \]

Since \(d_V = 4\) miles and \(d_V = v_V \times t_V\), we can see that \(t_V = 1\) minute. This is because the distance Vanessa ran is directly proportional to the time she took, and since she ran 4 miles, it took her 1 minute to run that distance at her speed.

Therefore, Vanessa took 1 minute to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine how much new line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock. Given that he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of new line."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by Tom's restaurant per night and then multiply it by the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine per night:
- Tom's restaurant orders 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order 1 bottle of wine at $5, so the cost for the wine is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost per night is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much revenue they generate per night. Since they get 6 reservations a night, and assuming each reservation results in one customer, the revenue per night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we need to calculate the total revenue for the week. The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total revenue for the week is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Thus, the total revenue for the week is 180 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we calculate the profit per watermelon and add it to the cost per watermelon:

\[
\text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine James's current age:**
   - Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, so she is currently 9 years old.
   - James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

2. **Determine the age of John when James was born:**
   - John was 19 years old when James was born, so John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

3. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange. Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes).

For Ana:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Ana in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \]

For Jane:
\[ \text{Oranges peeled by Jane in 60 minutes} = 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"To determine the total cost Mark paid for the radiator and the installation, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the radiator.
2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor.
3. Sum the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost.

First, the original cost of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets it at 80% off, the discount is 20% of $400. We calculate the discount as follows:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]
So, the discounted price of the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours of work. The labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{470} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. Let's confirm this by checking the total number of legs:
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- The total number of legs is \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given information.

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
