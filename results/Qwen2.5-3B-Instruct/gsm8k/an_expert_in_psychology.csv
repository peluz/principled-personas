"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs eaten for breakfast.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking.
4. The remainder will be the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market.
5. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.

Let's go through each step:

1. Total eggs laid per day: 16 eggs.
2. Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3 eggs.
3. Eggs used for baking: 4 eggs.

First, we subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast from the total eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Next, we subtract the eggs used for baking from the remaining eggs:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

So, Janet sells 9 eggs per day at the farmers' market.

Each fresh duck egg is sold for $2. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber}
   \]

3. To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:
   \[
   2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then invests an additional $50,000 in repairs. Therefore, the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The problem states that the repairs and subsequent investments increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the initial value of the house ($80,000) and add it to the initial value:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the initial value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the profit Josh made by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so the total distance for one sprint in a week is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week for all sprints:**
   Since James runs 3 sprints each week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair them up:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Restart and update installation:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the restart and update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
- Distance covered in the first segment: 180 miles.
- Distance covered in the third segment: 15 miles.
- Distance covered in the fourth segment: 120 miles.

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

The final numerical answer is:
315"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her earnings into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate:
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours at her overtime rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Now, we add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \boxed{460} \]"
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the expected market growth and then compare the profit from each plan.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Expected growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Expected growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize his profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, this means Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of the 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of the 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Let's denote the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered as \( x \). The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza boxes is:
\[ 8.50x \]

The total amount Marie paid is $50. Therefore, the equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 8.50:
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{243}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the time spent per day:**
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per day is:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Determine the time spent per week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23

"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each of the two 20-minute intervals and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both intervals:

\[ 4 \text{ (first 20 minutes)} + 5 \text{ (second 20 minutes)} = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after making these purchases. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games and the leftover money.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that John initially had $195 from selling his lego sets. To find out how much money he spent, we subtract the leftover money from the total money he had.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 190 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the total amount spent is $165, we can confirm that the calculation is consistent.

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Initially, he had 13 lego sets, and he sold all of them. Therefore, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running in a week.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. So, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he runs each of the other two days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, he runs:
\[ \text{Distance on the first day} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \]
\[ \text{Distance on the other two days} = 3 \text{ hours} / 2 = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \text{speed} \]

Since the total distance for the week is 60 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times \text{speed} + 2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \text{speed} = 60 \text{ miles} \]
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times \text{speed} + 3 \text{ hours/day} \times \text{speed} = 60 \text{ miles} \]
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times \text{speed} = 60 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John's speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \text{ miles/hour} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Suzy's iPhone:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin in this condition.

Given:
- Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
- With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

First, we calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = \text{Distance with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips can be consumed while staying within the daily calorie target.

First, let's calculate the total calories available in the 300g bag of chips:
- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 5 \times 250 = 1250 \) calories.

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day:
- The daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Therefore, the remaining calories are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Therefore, the number of servings that can be consumed is \( \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \) servings.

Since each serving is 500 grams (because 300 grams is 5 servings), the grams of chips that can be consumed are:
- \( 0.8 \times 500 = 400 \) grams.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
400"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of making the candles:**
   - Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles.
   - For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:

The net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \)
   - Calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
     \[
     5 + 2 = 7
     \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 \)
   - Therefore, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a red tie} = \text{Cost of a blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. There are 7 days in a week.

\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 1764 \, \text{eggs/week} \]

**Step 2: Convert the weekly egg count into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.

\[ \text{Dozens per week} = \frac{1764 \, \text{eggs/week}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 147 \, \text{dozen/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen.

\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = 147 \, \text{dozen/week} \times 2 \, \text{\$/dozen} = 294 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. However, the question does not specify the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact time it takes for him to travel back.

If we assume that the distance to his destination is \(D\) miles, then the time it takes to travel to the destination is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time to destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

The time it takes to travel back is given by:

\[ \text{Time to return} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the question does not provide the distance \(D\), we cannot provide a numerical answer. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer cannot be determined with the given information."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the number of good oranges, we need to first understand the distribution of the oranges in the basket.

1. **Total Oranges**: 25
2. **Bad Oranges**: 1
3. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of 25
4. **Sour Oranges**: 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, we know the total number of oranges that are either bad, unripe, or sour:
\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \]

Subtract this from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $50,000, which is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

So, after 30 years, her annual pension will be the sum of the pension from the first 20 years and the pension from the next 10 years.

- Pension from the first 20 years = $1,000,000.
- Pension from the next 10 years = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000.

Adding these together, her annual pension after 30 years will be:
\[ \$1,000,000 + \$25,000 = \$1,025,000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1,025,000 \]"
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment structure into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges $140 per month.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Total cost for the first half:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The streaming service charges 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge for the second half:
     \[
     140 \text{ dollars} - 14 \text{ dollars} = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total cost for the second half:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum the costs of the first and second halves:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate how much gas she has used and how much gas is left in the tank.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles since her last fill-up, and she needed 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. This means that the 4 gallons of gas she used to refill her tank is the amount of gas she had left after her last trip. Therefore, the total capacity of her tank is the amount of gas she used to refill plus the amount of gas she had left, which is 4 gallons + 4 gallons = 8 gallons.

The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Since she has already used 4 gallons, the remaining amount of gas in the tank is 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 8 gallons of gas. Since she drove 100 miles with 4 gallons of gas, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With 8 gallons of gas, the distance she can drive is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 8 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 4:

\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount Sarah does by 2:

\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. We subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- Therefore, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The difference in cost is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Thus, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the discount amount. The original cost of the grooming is $100, and the discount is 30%.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the final cost of the grooming is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much water each of the two girls received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

So, each girl received 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we account for the 6 liters of water that the boy received. The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. After the girls and the boy have taken their portions, the amount of water left is:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 8 \text{ liters} - 6 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the number of liters of water left is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"

So, the total number of stickers Charlie had before giving any away or using any is:
\[ 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 \]

Next, we account for the stickers Charlie gave away and used:
- He gave 9 stickers to his sister.
- He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

The total number of stickers used or given away is:
\[ 9 + 28 = 37 \]

Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is:
\[ 54 - 37 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"First, let's determine Alex's weight. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

To find Alex's weight, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we need to find their combined weights. We add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Therefore, their combined weights are 623 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 623 \]"
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15.

The final numerical answer is:

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. The number of vacations he has taken is the difference between his current age and his age when he started vacationing, plus one (since he started his first vacation at age 23).

So, the number of vacations is:
\[ 34 - 23 + 1 = 12 \]

Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each alarm ring and then sum the total rings.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Therefore, it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum the total number of rings:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

6. **Salary Increase for the Third Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, Christina will spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:

\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28

"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:

- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( Jm \) be James's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. James is 10 years old, so \( Jm = 10 \).
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( C = Jm + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \).
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so \( A = J + 5 \).
4. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so \( A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \).

Now we can substitute the value of \( A \) into the equation \( A = J + 5 \):
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine Lee's original speed:**
   Since Lee runs 400 meters in 38 seconds, his speed is:
   \[
   \text{Lee's speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Determine Gerald's original speed:**
   Since Gerald runs 400 meters in 40 seconds, his original speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's new speed after a 10% improvement:**
   A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald's new speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new speed} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.10 = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's new time with the improved diet:**
   With his new speed of 11 meters/second, Gerald's new time to run 400 meters is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}

"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C = 2D \) (since there are two cats for every dog).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

According to the problem, the number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than this combined number:
\[ R = (D + C) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - When the tomatoes are cooked, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - So, the original volume of tomatoes was \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - The number of 16-ounce cans used is \( \frac{64}{16} = 4 \) cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

Here's the breakdown of the hours he watched TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, we sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, Henry intended to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more, we can verify:

\[ 2 \times 100 + 15 = 215 \]

This confirms that Henry baked 215 cookies, and after dropping 5, he has 110 cookies, which matches the problem statement.

The number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

\[ \text{Total cost after cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is \$28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her fruit roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- His fruit roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Julia to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{1.25 \text{ feet/second}} = 51.2 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water taken on for 51.2 feet can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{51.2 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 10.24 \times 2 = 20.48 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[ \boxed{20.48} \]"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Lessons per Teacher per Day**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. **Lessons per Day in Total**: Since there are 4 teachers and each has 2 lessons per day, the total number of lessons per day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) lessons.
4. **Cleanings per Lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.
5. **Total Cleanings per Day**: Since there are 8 lessons per day and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of cleanings per day is \(8 \times 3 = 24\).

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final numerical answer is:

"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so the total number of flowers he planted is:

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

If 5 of these flowers did not grow, then the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the quantities given and use them to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - According to the problem, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - According to the problem, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each: \(10 \times 10 = \$100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each: \(5 \times 16 = \$80\)

The total cost of the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue Sasha will get from selling all the leftover lumber:

- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at the original price: \(10 \times 10 = \$100\)
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the original price: \(5 \times 16 = \$80\)

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
\[ \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts is sugar. Since sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\).

We can now calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total amount of sugar and water by the fraction that represents the sugar:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 120 \times \frac{7}{20}
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
120 \times \frac{7}{20} = 120 \times 0.35 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vehicles cleared on the first day.
2. Determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, we calculate the total number of vehicles cleared on the first day:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we determine the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day. The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \approx 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down the problem day by day and then sum the hours.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours for each day of the week:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 7 \text{ (Friday)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second part where she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first part:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. Calculate the remaining time after the first part:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

3. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining Time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

4. Calculate the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

First, we know that Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
This means that 20 letters are now stamped and added to the pile of already-stamped letters.

We are also told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since 20 of these are the newly stamped letters, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters that were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

After Julia used 3 spoons, she had \( x - 3 \) spoons left. Her husband then gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x - 3 + 5 = x + 2 \) spoons. According to the problem, after these transactions, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons. Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   Given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - **Watermelons:**
     Dillon buys 4 watermelons.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Peppers:**
     Dillon buys 20 peppers.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost associated with these visits.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours (since 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours).
- The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
- Therefore, the revenue per patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.
- With 500 patients per day, the total revenue is $80 * 500 = $40,000.

Next, let's calculate the total cost associated with the visits:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
- Therefore, the cost per patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.
- With 500 patients per day, the total cost is $60 * 500 = $30,000.

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital's profit from these visits is $10,000."
"To determine the number of elves left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **Initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.
2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 of the remaining elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves remaining after this is:

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of miles he walked on Tuesday is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We are given that the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday through Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday through Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is:

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much money he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he spends playing video games in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, the total amount of money he would earn in one week if he worked those 14 hours is:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups.

The cost of nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of nonfood items before tax = $3 + $4 = $7

The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the nonfood items is:
\[ \text{Tax} = 7 \times \frac{10}{100} = 0.70 \]

The total cost of nonfood items including tax is:
\[ \text{Total cost of nonfood items including tax} = 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 = $8

Adding the total cost of food items and the total cost of nonfood items including tax:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 7.70 = 15.70 \]

So, the total cost including tax is:
\[ \boxed{15.70} \]"
"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

First, let's calculate the total income:
- Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of 8 clients.
- Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.
- The cost of 2 bottles of bleach per client is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths per client is 5 dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per client is \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.
- Since he has 8 clients, his total income is \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total expenses:
- Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.
- The cost of 2 bottles of bleach per client is 4 dollars.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths per client is 5 dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per client is 9 dollars.
- Since he has 8 clients, his total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Now, we can calculate the profit:
- Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
- Total income is 72 dollars.
- Total expenses are 72 dollars.
- Therefore, the profit is \(72 - 72 = 0\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest per hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total number of hectares.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since he harvests every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of harvests as follows:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that John has 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the number of pineapples he can harvest from one hectare in a year is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pieces in each lego set that Johnny has:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's sum up the total number of pieces (or blocks) that Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 2125. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, she sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave as she saw leave in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before had not already returned. The total number of bees that left before is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (next 6 hours) = 90 bees. Since all of these bees return in the last 6 hours, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 90.

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of a child ticket is $10.

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine who will finish the race first and by how much time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from school to their respective homes.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim takes 40 minutes to reach his house, and Steve takes 36 minutes. Therefore, the difference in their travel times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

The winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
- Total cost = Cost for bicycles + Cost for tricycles + Cost for the unicycle
- Total cost = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid:

\[
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \) fries.
6. The ant then ate the last remaining french fry, leaving 5 fries.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \):
\[ x - 20 = 15 \]
\[ x = 35 \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 35.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours from both types of days to find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one week:
\[9 \text{ hours (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)} + 8 \text{ hours (Tuesday, Thursday)} = 17 \text{ hours per week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[17 \text{ hours per week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 2 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:

"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards.
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months. 
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Each price increase is by 120% of the previous price. This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by 1.20. 

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**: If the initial price is \( P_0 \), after \( n \) increases, the price \( P_n \) is given by:
   \[
   P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n
   \]

6. **Applying the Formula**: Here, \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \):
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

7. **Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

8. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76.

"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to determine the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - One red car costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 red cars is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) dollars.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - We are given that an action figure costs $5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 action figures is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the toys:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

Total cost = \( 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

Thus, the total value of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90. Therefore, the additional money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much money Jimmy has, we start by defining the amount of money Ethel has. According to the problem, Ethel has $8. Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as \( E \). Therefore, \( E = 8 \).

The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ J = 2E + 2 \]

Substituting the value of \( E \) into the equation:
\[ J = 2(8) + 2 \]

First, we calculate \( 2 \times 8 \):
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Next, we add 2 to the result:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Thus, Jimmy has $18. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

First, let's calculate the miles he walks from Monday to Friday:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- He walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
- Therefore, the total miles walked from Monday to Friday is \(5 \times 20 = 100\) miles.

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on the weekend:
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- He walks 10 miles each day on the weekend.
- Therefore, the total miles walked on the weekend is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) miles.

Now, we add the miles walked from the weekdays and the weekend to get the total miles walked in a week:
- Total miles in a week = Miles from weekdays + Miles from the weekend
- Total miles in a week = \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost of the hat and jacket} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of the uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$25 + \$75 + \$50 = \$150

"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders**: There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs.
   \[
   80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 640 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Insects**: There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs.
   \[
   90 \text{ insects} \times 6 \text{ legs/insect} = 540 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Mutant Invertebrates**: There are 3 mutant invertebrates, and each mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   \[
   3 \text{ mutant invertebrates} \times 10 \text{ legs/mutant invertebrate} = 30 \text{ legs}
   \]

Now, we sum the legs from all the groups:
\[
640 \text{ legs} + 540 \text{ legs} + 30 \text{ legs} = 1210 \text{ legs}
\]

Thus, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four} + \text{Age of the Caboose}
\]

Since the problem does not specify the age of the Caboose, we assume it is a placeholder for the total age of the four birds. However, if we are to find the total age of the four birds, we can sum the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, and Sally Four:

\[
\text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 = 43
\]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is 43."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for easier calculation:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 95 \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   - We know that Bo has 40 crabs.
   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   - Therefore, Monic has \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
   - Monic has 36 crabs.
   - Therefore, Rani has \( 36 + 10 = 46 \) crabs.

3. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**
   - Bo has 40 crabs.
   - Monic has 36 crabs.
   - Rani has 46 crabs.
   - The total number of crabs is \( 40 + 36 + 46 \).

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes, and the total number of votes cast was 80.

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, we need to determine Mark's current age. Since Jan is 30 years old and two years ago Jan was 28, we can use the information about Mark's age two years ago.

Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of 28, which is:

\[ \frac{28}{2} + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 \]

This means Mark was 19 years old two years ago. Therefore, Mark's current age is:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

Thus, Jean is 23 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are four members in the team.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in time between the two teams:
- Difference in time = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[
P(\text{even on first and second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 70 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader makes a profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:
- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The total cost of tickets and food is $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
- They went on 2 rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.

Now, let's find the total expenses:
- The total expenses are the sum of the cost of tickets, food, and rides, which is $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since there are 3 friends, we need to divide the total expenses by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
- Each friend paid $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"To determine how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that the total amount of insects needed per week for one duck is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily amount of insects needed for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much insects the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day. We do this by multiplying the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the net increase in trees each year:**
   - Tom plants 10 trees.
   - Tom chops down 2 trees.
   - Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

2. **Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years:**
   - Tom starts with 50 trees.
   - Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is 8 trees per year.
   - Total increase over 10 years = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
   - Total number of trees after 10 years = 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees.

3. **Account for the trees that die after 10 years:**
   - 30% of the trees die.
   - Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
   - Number of trees left = 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

Thus, after 10 years, Tom has 91 trees left.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much change Violetta will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards collected:**
   We sum the cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total collected:
   \[
   20 + 320 = 340
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{340}\)."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the water he gets in the morning and the afternoon separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the water Baldur gets in the morning:
   - He gets 5 pails of water every morning.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the water he gets in the morning is \(5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters}\).

2. Calculate the water Baldur gets in the afternoon:
   - He gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the water he gets in the afternoon is \(6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters}\).

3. Sum the water from the morning and the afternoon to find the total water Baldur gets every day:
   - Total water = water in the morning + water in the afternoon
   - Total water = \(25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

Thus, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is \(\boxed{55}\) liters."
"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's original weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary:
- New weekly salary = Original weekly salary + Raise
- New weekly salary = \( 2000 + 100 = 2100 \) dollars per week.

Now, we calculate the total amount of money John made in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total annual salary = New weekly salary \(\times\) Number of weeks in a year
- Total annual salary = \( 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total annual salary:
- Total annual income = Total annual salary + Monetary reward
- Total annual income = \( 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is **114200 dollars**."

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for the macaroni and cheese dish: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Therefore, the total sum of the six scores needed is:
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of the six test scores is:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then sum these weights.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**

   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \text{ cakes}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{20} = 1740 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost of each cup:**
   - One dozen cups consists of 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of each cup is:
     \[
     \frac{1740}{12} = 145 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the $70.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). The total amount of money Sara will have after mowing the lawn is the sum of the money she already has and the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[10 + 4x \geq 70\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):
\[4x \geq 60\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x \geq 15\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[15\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) taken to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking around the park."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
   - The number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Determine the total number of customers over the first two days.
   - The total number of customers on the first two days is \(100 + 150 = 250\).

4. Calculate the number of customers on the third day.
   - The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

Given:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the pair of shoes and the matching belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the purchase is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount. 

The additional amount is calculated as:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. To find the remaining balance, we subtract the amount paid from the total amount promised:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Given that there are 4 roses and there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**

     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount of the remaining water in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we calculate the total number of flowers planted by adding the number of geraniums and the number of petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

After buying 14 new grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses five empty pens to make one new pen, he reduces the number of empty pens by 4 (since he uses 5 pens and gets 1 new pen).

Let's break down the process step by step:

- Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
- After using 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he has 20 pens left (25 - 5 = 20).
- He can now use another 5 pens to make another new pen, reducing the number of empty pens to 15 (20 - 5 = 15).
- He can continue this process until he has fewer than 5 empty pens left.

To find out how many new pens he can make, we divide the number of empty pens by 5:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \]

This means Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens he initially has.

Now, let's add these new pens to the original 25 pens:

\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram has is:

\[

3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on her makeup over the course of the movie.

She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours of makeup required = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we calculate the total cost after the discount.

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate over the two days and then convert that into calories.

First, let's determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we sum the cookies eaten by Sue and her sister over the two days:
- Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister: \( 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \) cookies.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue: \( 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \) cookies.

Next, we convert the total cookies into calories. Each cookie has 200 calories:
- Calories consumed by Sue's sister: \( 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \) calories.
- Calories consumed by Sue: \( 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 5040 - 1520 = 3520 \]

So, Sue consumed 3520 more calories than her sister. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3520}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - Also, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is \( 15 - 3 = 12 \).

3. **Calculating Today's Wolves:**
   - Since today's number of cougars is 12, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

4. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed in total: \( 10 \text{ (previous night)} + 36 \text{ (today)} = 46 \)
   - Cougars killed in total: \( 15 \text{ (previous night)} + 12 \text{ (today)} = 27 \)

5. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Total animals killed: \( 46 \text{ (wolves)} + 27 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \)

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar Bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1.00. Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   \[
   40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/dollar bill} = 40 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section.

\[
\text{Total weight before damage} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so if Jamal has \( J_b \) bananas, then Andrea has \( \frac{J_b}{2} \) bananas. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can use this to find the number of bananas Jamal has.

First, we know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
This means Jamal has 48 bananas. Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has:
\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \] bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so Andrea has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so Jamal has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house that Mrs. Cruz needs to pay, which includes the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

1. **Selling Price**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

Next, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

\[
\text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]
\[
\text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   The net proceeds are the selling price minus the total expenses and the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 128,000

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the first scene: \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \).
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
   - Number of Sean's lines in the first scene: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Number of lines in the second scene: \( 54 + 6 = 60 \).
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
   - Number of Sean's lines in the second scene: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \).

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many cards remained after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we find out how many cards had the letter D on them. The remaining cards after removing those with letters A, B, and C are those with the letter D:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we sum the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes (small holes) + 150 minutes (large holes) = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 4 hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream bars} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ice cream bar} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
2. Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots.
5. Find half of the combined total number of spots.

Step 1: Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
A cobra has 70 spots, and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:
\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:
\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:
\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Step 4: Find the combined total number of spots.
The combined total number of spots is the sum of the spots of all the cobras and all the mambas:
\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Step 5: Find half of the combined total number of spots.
Half of the combined total number of spots is:
\[ \text{Half of combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be attending the soccer game. 

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Maddy will spend is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up the totals for all three:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents. We subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.

We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, 3 trucks are sufficient to transport the 80 flagstones.

Thus, the number of trucks needed is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - The total number of medals given out is \(10 \times 39 = 390\).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we need to distribute these remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the half-hour break she takes. This means she works for:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the extra point: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the extra point: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the household and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each day they consume:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

Weekly hours worked:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

Weekly earnings from hourly wage:
\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Next, we add the weekly bonus:
- Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.

Total weekly earnings:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 30 days.

Number of weeks in April:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 4.29 \text{ weeks} \]

Since we are considering a full month, we will consider 4 full weeks and the remaining days.

Total earnings for 4 full weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Remaining days in April:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - (4 \times 7 \text{ days}) = 30 \text{ days} - 28 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Earnings for the remaining 2 days:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

Earnings for 2 days:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$200 \]

Total earnings for the month of April:
\[ \$3200 + \$200 = \$3400 \]

Thus, Watson made \(\boxed{3400}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:
\[ \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

Then, we determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. Since half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening:
\[ \text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \text{Weight Joey loses per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (2 pounds) that Joey loses in one week, Sandy will take:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum up the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Therefore, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6."
"To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
   - In fifteen days, we can calculate the number of three-day intervals by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, a person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
   - In fifteen days, we can calculate the number of five-day intervals by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, a person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

To find out how much he can spend on gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the entire family:**
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   \[
   13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we need to first determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.

So, Jane's age is:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
- Therefore, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness. So, the number of people with previous commitments is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) people.

The total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\) people.

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\) people.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"First, let's determine the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store's existing marbles.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of Boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of Boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total Number of Children} = \text{Number of Boys} + \text{Number of Girls} + \text{Number of Nongendered Children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following relationship:

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women left at the party after some people left.

First, let's calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
- Number of men: 25
- Number of women: 15
- Total number of people: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of men who left as \(M_{\text{left}}\). Since 22 men stayed, the number of men who left is:
\[
M_{\text{left}} = 25 - 22 = 3
\]

Since 10 people in total left, the number of women who left is:
\[
W_{\text{left}} = 10 - M_{\text{left}} = 10 - 3 = 7
\]

Now, we can determine the number of women who stayed at the party. Initially, there were 15 women, and 7 women left:
\[
W_{\text{stayed}} = 15 - 7 = 8
\]

Thus, the number of women left at the party is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has and then figure out how many boxes are needed to store all of them.

First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. We also know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils, we need to consider the total number of pencils and the capacity of the boxes. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required for 26 pencils and 46 pencils separately.

For Jam's pencils:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{26}{8} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 3.25 \right\rceil = 4 \]
So, Jam needs 4 boxes.

For Meg's pencils:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{46}{8} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 5.75 \right\rceil = 6 \]
So, Meg needs 6 boxes.

Adding the boxes needed for both Jam and Meg:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of boxes needed to store all their pencils is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of both the cooling and the addition of cream separately, and then combine them.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. Therefore, the cream does not affect the milliliters weaker, but it does increase the total volume of the drink.

Since the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, and adding cream does not change the strength in terms of milliliters, the final answer is solely based on the cooling effect.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we can use the given exchange rate: 2 old records for 1 new record. 

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in by using the exchange rate. 

Since 1 new record is equivalent to 2 old records, 7 new records would be equivalent to \(7 \times 2 = 14\) old records.

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. Let's break down the information and calculations step by step.

1. **Total number of employees**: 100
2. **Number of Junior programmers**: \(\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\)
3. **Number of Senior programmers**: \(100 - 40 = 60\)
4. **Payment for Junior programmers**: $2000 per month
5. **Payment for Senior programmers**: $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Now, we calculate the total monthly payment for Junior programmers:
\[ 40 \text{ Junior programmers} \times \$2000 \text{ per Junior programmer} = \$80,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total monthly payment for Senior programmers:
\[ 60 \text{ Senior programmers} \times \$2400 \text{ per Senior programmer} = \$144,000 \]

Finally, we add the total payments for Junior and Senior programmers to find the total amount the company pays to all the programmers per month:
\[ \$80,000 + \$144,000 = \$224,000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required.

The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required for a 40% increase as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To determine how much the customer paid on this shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.
3. Calculate the discount from the coupon.
4. Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.**

The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip. Since they spent $43, they used the $4 in rewards. The remaining amount of rewards is:
\[
4 - 4 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount from the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they used $4 in rewards, the discount from the coupon is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.**

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. After applying the $4 in rewards, the price becomes:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, applying the $8 discount from the coupon:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- State tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Finally, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is \(\boxed{310}\) ounces."
"To determine the final value of all of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Investment:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Investment} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **Price Increase in the First Year:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value of Shares at the End of the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Value at the end of the first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

4. **Price Decrease in the Second Year:**
   The stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:
\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in all three groups:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. Therefore, he would have started juggling with \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. This leaves him with \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls.

Two of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, and one is lost completely. This means that the number of balls Josh is left with to juggle is still 4.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of the other animals based on the given information and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

1. **Weight of the pink frog:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of pink frog} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the blue beetle:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of blue beetle} = \text{Weight of pink frog} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of green toad} = \text{Weight of pink frog} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = \text{Weight of pink frog} + 10 \text{ pounds} = 50 \text{ pounds} + 10 \text{ pounds} = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = \text{Weight of pink frog} - 20 \text{ pounds} = 50 \text{ pounds} - 20 \text{ pounds} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we sum the weights of one of each animal:
\[
\text{Total weight of one pink frog, one blue beetle, one green toad, one yellow snake, and one red bird} = 50 \text{ pounds} + 50 \text{ pounds} + 50 \text{ pounds} + 60 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds}
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June after following his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the new daily distance Tyson runs.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days in June).
4. Provide the final numerical answer.

First, let's calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson should run is:

\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days):

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

- The difference is $11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C costs $2 more than Juice Box B. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag} \times 36 \text{ cookies per bag} = 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box over the 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Then, we calculate the number of cookies her husband eats over 7 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we subtract the cookies that Jenny's son and husband eat from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 19 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they were making them:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they are making them:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors.

The increase in daily revenue is:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

The percentage increase is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Increase in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the activities:
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10. Therefore, the cost for two rides is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- She also wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.

Adding these costs together:
\[
5 \text{ (mini-golf)} + 20 \text{ (go-karts)} + 5 \text{ (arcade tokens)} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After accounting for the $30 spent on the activities, the remaining budget is:
\[
90 - 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the remaining $60 can be used to buy snacks, drinks, or other party supplies, we need to determine how many friends she can invite. Assuming each friend gets $10 (the cost of one go-kart ride), the number of friends she can invite is:
\[
\frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ friends}
\]

Therefore, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{6}\) friends."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we calculate how much money Marisa receives as pocket money each day. She gets $5 every day.

Now, we find out how much money Marisa saves each day by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Marisa saves $4 each day. To find out how much she saves over 5 days, we multiply her daily savings by 5:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Billy started with $10 and spent some of it on candy. Let's denote the amount of candy he bought as \( x \) pounds. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the change Billy received after buying the candy:**
   Since Billy started with $10, the change he received after buying the candy is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs:**
   Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars. Therefore, half of his change is $2, which means the total change he received is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation for the change:**
   The change he received is \( 10 - 1.5x = 4 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 1.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one complete trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city segments, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{675}{18000} = \frac{675 \div 75}{18000 \div 75} = \frac{9}{240} = \frac{3}{80}\]

This fraction represents the number of days between services. To find the number of days, we need to determine how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles. Since the train travels 675 miles per day, the number of days between services is:
\[\frac{18000}{675} = 26.6667 \approx 27 \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing required for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.8571 hours

2. **Detour:**
   - Additional distance: 10 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.1429 hours

3. **Trip back home:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we sum the times for all segments:
\[ 2.8571 \text{ hours} + 0.1429 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5.0000 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip took:

"First, let's determine the total number of fourth-grade students at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

Next, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys are at the school. We know that 43 of the 96 students are girls, so the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find out how many boys were present, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points required is:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( C \). According to the problem, \( C = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4C - 5 \). Substituting \( C = 3 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers and shoplifters and those for physical violence can be calculated as follows:
\[ C + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Sara has:
\[ \text{Sara's points} = 8 \]

Next, calculate the points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin now has 24 points and she scored 14 points recently, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces as follows:
\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4 \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Next, we need to find the number of functioning pieces. Since the total number of pieces is the sum of the faulty and functioning pieces, we can express the number of functioning pieces as:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = \text{Total number of pieces} - \text{Number of faulty pieces} \]

The total number of pieces can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the cost per piece. However, since we don't know the cost per piece directly, we can use the percentage of faulty pieces to find the number of functioning pieces directly. The number of functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = \text{Total number of pieces} - 0.4 \times \text{Total number of pieces} = 0.6 \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Since the total cost is $400,000, the total number of pieces is:
\[ \text{Total number of pieces} = \frac{400000}{\text{Cost per piece}} \]

But we don't need the cost per piece to find the number of functioning pieces. We can directly use the percentage:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times \text{Total number of pieces} = 0.6 \times \frac{400000}{\text{Cost per piece}} = 0.6 \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Since the total number of pieces is the same, the number of functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times \text{Total number of pieces} = 0.6 \times \frac{400000}{\text{Cost per piece}} = 0.6 \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

The total cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = \text{Number of functioning pieces} \times \text{Cost per piece} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:
\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
3. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep. These 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.
4. **Milk from the first half**: 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
5. **Milk from the second half**: 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day:
\[
1 \, \text{kg} + 2 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
\[
\boxed{3}

12 \text{ bread rolls}
\]

Next, we account for the bread rolls she fed to her 6 children. Each child received one roll, so the number of rolls given to the children is:

\[
6 \text{ rolls}
\]

Subtracting the rolls given to the children from the total number of rolls, we find the number of rolls remaining:

\[
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ rolls}
\]

Each of the remaining rolls was broken into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is:

\[
6 \text{ rolls} \times 8 \text{ pieces per roll} = 48 \text{ pieces}

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

1. Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

2. Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks.

3. Adding the socks from the pairs and the loose socks gives:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

4. There are 50 socks in total that need washing. To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total repayment amount by the number of months.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since the loan period is five months, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for five months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.1667\%
   \]
   The total interest for five months on a $3,650 loan is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times \frac{4.1667}{100} = 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be repaid} = 3650 + 150 = 3800
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. This means that only half of the female members can perform. Therefore, the number of female members who can perform is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can determine how many popsicles each person has by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio.

First, we calculate the value of one part:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Next, we find out how many popsicles Betty has:
\[
\text{Popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]

Then, we find out how many popsicles Sam has:
\[

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Next, we'll calculate the total time spent on all activities:
\[ \text{Total time} = 240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we'll find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate the percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is \(20\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine the number of books Wendy needs to place in the shelving system, we first need to calculate the total number of slots available in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of slots is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books Wendy wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, this number is 20 more than double the number of slots, which can be expressed as:

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

Now, we calculate the value of \( x \):

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before any are passed out or received is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards that were passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards passed out and received from the total number of cards she had initially:
\[ 50 - 24 - 17 = 50 - 41 = 9 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices in the pizza is 12. So, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- Total flour needed: 12 cups
- Number of 2-cup bags required: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- Total milk needed: 4 cups
- Number of 2-cup bottles required: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"To determine the energy savings, we first need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original and reduced usage conditions.

1. **Original Usage:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
   - It is used for 8 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:
     \[
     7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy consumption is:
     \[
     7.2 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 216 \text{ kWh}
     \]

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, so the new usage is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
     \]
   - The daily energy consumption with the reduced usage is:
     \[
     900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day}
     \]
   - Converting to kilowatt-hours:
     \[
     2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - Over 30 days, the total energy consumption is:
     \[
     2.7 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 81 \text{ kWh}
     \]

3. **Energy Savings:**
   - The energy saved over 30 days is the difference between the original and reduced energy consumption:
     \[
     216 \text{ kWh} - 81 \text{ kWh} = 135 \text{ kWh}
     \]

Therefore, the number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[
\boxed{135}

   - Number of sandwiches = \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) sandwiches.

2. **Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - Total meat required = 5 pounds.
   - Total cheese required = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
   - Total cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is $50.00.

\[
\boxed{50}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corn to cannolis ratio**: There is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the initial number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. **Cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Corn after buying fewer**: The number of corns is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis. Since the number of cannolis is now 100, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. This is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{Number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps from School and Home**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, he has taken:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Additional Steps**: He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps taken before his jog are:

"First, we need to determine the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page contains 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time required to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, he needs to leave 60 minutes before he reaches the airport. Since it will take him 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Thus, he will be:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 30 minutes early. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with the following pricing: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for the first pound, Sally pays $3, and for the second pound, she pays $3/2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items Sally bought. The cost of the taffy is $4.50, the cost of the seashells is $6.00, and the cost of the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00. Adding these together, the total cost is $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. After spending $11.50, she would be $1.50 short. Therefore, Sally does not have enough money to buy all the items she wanted. However, the question asks how much money Sally has left, and since she does not have enough money, the answer is that she has $0 left.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Adding these together gives:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make to last her for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   - Shannon eats 2 cookies per night.
   - There are 30 days in the period she wants the cookies to last.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days is:
     \[
     2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
     \]

2. **Determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs:**

   - To find out how many dozens of cookies are needed for 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, we can calculate the number of dangerous candles as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Since 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, the number of dangerous candles that also smell like wet dog is:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 2,500 \times 0.05 = 125 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathers \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees, and doesn't gather any from the average trees. So, her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees and \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees as \( S_{\text{avg}} \). The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + S_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Substituting the known values for \( A_{\text{tall}} \) and \( A_{\text{short}} \):
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + S_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} + S_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Since Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees, \( S_{\text{avg}} = 0 \). So the equation simplifies to:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350. \]

Therefore, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \( \boxed{350} \)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (total number of humps)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for \( C \):
\[ C = 180 - D \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - D) + D = 304 \]

Now, we simplify and solve for \( D \):
\[ 360 - 2D + D = 304 \]
\[ 360 - D = 304 \]
\[ -D = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -D = -56 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( D = 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( D = 56 \) back into the equation \( C = 180 - D \):
\[ C = 180 - 56 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

To verify, we check the total number of humps:
\[ 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"

   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \).

The total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is \( 40 \) cubic inches.

\[
\boxed{40}

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is calculated as follows:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7000 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. Therefore, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the total amount of money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17000 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. So, the number of cats that ran away is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final numerical answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   \[
   2 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$24
   \]

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   \[
   18 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$252
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
\$48 + \$24 + \$252 = \$324
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{324}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 and the original cost of the tattered jeans was $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. Additionally, the bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. Therefore, her bird feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

So, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 180 birds.

The final numerical answer is 180."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price.
   \[
   \text{25% of the bagel's price} = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the soup} = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake is half the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost of the dinner:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards because he keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

He sells each card for $1.5, so the total amount of money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money earned} = \left( \frac{2}{3}x \right) \times 1.5 = 1x = x \]

According to the problem, after selling the cards, Kenny has $50 in spending cash. He also needs to pay $100 for the ticket to the amusement park. Therefore, the total amount of money he has after selling the cards is:
\[ x = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

So, we have:
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotdogs were prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hotdogs prepared:
- The caterer was told to prepare enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
- There were 40 guests, so half of the guests is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) guests.
- Each of these 20 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) hotdogs.

Next, we need to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog:
- There were 40 guests, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.
- Since the caterer only prepared 40 hotdogs, only 40 guests could get a second hotdog.
- Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 40 - 40 = 0 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters. Adding these together gives:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora currently has:

- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"First, let's determine the number of dragons slain by each prince based on the information provided.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container contains:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then use that information to find out how many candy bars he bought.

First, let's denote the total amount of money George had as \( M \). According to the problem, George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means that the amount of money he spent is 99% of his total money. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99M = 5 \]

To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \):

\[ M = \frac{5}{0.99} = \frac{500}{99} \approx 5.0505 \]

Next, we know that George spent $5 on chips and candy bars. Let's denote the number of candy bars he bought as \( x \). The cost of the chips is $0.40 per bag and the cost of each candy bar is $0.75. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

The total cost of the chips and candy bars is $5, so the cost of the candy bars is:

\[ 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 \]

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, the number of candy bars \( x \) he bought is:

\[ x = \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since the number of candy bars must be a whole number, we recognize that \( \frac{76}{15} = 5 \) (as the exact division gives 5 candy bars with a small remainder that doesn't affect the whole number of candy bars).

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray initially had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory cuts into pieces. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have. Since each of them has one piece, the weight of the cake they have together is:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, we need to find the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of people sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine uses. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater, it will take Bernadette \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes to drive to the theater.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to drive to the theater, she should leave \(16 - 5 = 11\) minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 11 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven being on for 3 hours. Since the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, the total temperature increase is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after 3 hours of baking is:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the temperature decrease due to the window being open for 30 minutes. The window causes a cooling of 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the total cooling is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature of the house after the window is opened for 30 minutes is:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile:

\[ \text{Bails of hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay:

\[ \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3/\text{bail} = \$24 \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which totals:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30 \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael has after buying the hay:

\[ \text{Change} = \$30 - \$24 = \$6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is now winning:

Joey's new score: 240 points
Marcy's new score: 235 points

The difference in their scores is:

240 - 235 = 5 points

Therefore, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining sneakers are:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The department store bought these 31 sneakers for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from both sales:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by choosing the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket minus the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $2. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both segments:
\[120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\]

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of green and yellow cards, and then sum all the cards.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - Calculate 60% of 15:
     \[
     0.60 \times 15 = 9
     \]
   - Add this to the number of red cards to find the number of green cards:
     \[
     15 + 9 = 24
     \]
   - So, there are 24 green cards.

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - Calculate the sum of red and green cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 = 39
     \]
   - So, there are 39 yellow cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. To verify, if Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he can have \( \frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \) cookies, which matches the problem's condition.

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{10} \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
|A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in total. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

\[
32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20

\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

Thus, the combined weight of the two pennies is:

\[
\boxed{84}

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per person is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at second venue} = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. Set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, solve for \( n \):
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[
200 = 20n
\]
Divide both sides by 20:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of a skein of yarn} \]

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, the total number of yards they used is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

So, Tara earned a profit of $288 on her canvas bags."

2. **Calculate the total number of punches thrown:**
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Over a 15-minute fight, the total number of punches thrown is \( 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \).

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."
"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies.
2. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]
3. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies Josh made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

So, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount can be calculated as follows:

\[
4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

So, Ali has a total of $160.

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. The amount given to his sister is:

\[
\frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[
160 - 80 = 80
\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints the house.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The rate of one person painting the house is \(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\).
3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.
5. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which simplifies to \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O \). Since \( C_O = 22 \), we have \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has \( S_O + C_O = 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has \( S_J + C_J = 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 42 + 130 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the headphone set:**
   - Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
   - The CD cost $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
     \[
     48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the money spent on the headphone set:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - With $44, the number of CDs Tom could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ CDs}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom would have $48.
   - With $48, the number of CDs he could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}
     \]

Thus, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 1 more CD. The final numerical answer is:

- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, we calculate the total hours for each period:
- For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
  \[
  6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
  \]
- For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
  \[
  2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}
  \]
- For the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(70 - 21 + 7 = 56\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jame's current age and then use that information to find out his cousin's current age. Finally, we will find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years.

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22 years.

"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
\[ C = 1100 \]
\[ P = C - 400 \]

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now substitute the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with \( M \):
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( B \) be the number of boys.
- \( G \) be the number of girls.
- \( S_b \) be the number of seashells each boy brought.
- \( S_g \) be the number of seashells each girl brought.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are 20 kids in total, so \( B + G = 20 \).
2. The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each, so \( S_b = 60 \).
3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, so \( S_g = S_b + 4 \times S_b = 5 \times S_b \).

Since \( S_b = 60 \), we can calculate \( S_g \) as follows:
\[ S_g = 5 \times 60 = 300. \]

Thus, each girl brought 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save in the second half of April to meet his monthly target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

First, let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly target is $1125, so we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save \( x = 25 \) dollars per day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Thus, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the cashier. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Jairus earns for completing 20 tasks. Jairus earns $0.8 for each task. Therefore, for 20 tasks, he earns:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Jenny earns for completing 20 tasks. Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. Therefore, for 20 tasks, she earns:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract the amount Jenny earns from the amount Jairus earns:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Distance for one round trip:**
   - Jeff walks to his work and back home each day.
   - The distance to his work is 3 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is \(3 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Number of round trips per week:**
   - Jeff works 5 times a week.
   - Each day he makes 1 round trip.
   - Therefore, in 5 days, he makes \(5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ round trips}\).

3. **Total distance walked in a week:**
   - Each round trip is 6 miles.
   - Over 5 round trips, the total distance is \(5 \times 6 \text{ miles} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Thus, the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting:**
   Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting:**
   Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting:**
   Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and half of the alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing 65 letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: 52 letters
- Second rewriting: 13 letters
- Third rewriting: 65 letters

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item he wants to buy before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. **Cost of notebooks:**
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks.
   - Total cost for notebooks = \( 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of pens:**
   - Each pen costs $0.25.
   - Daniel wants to buy 2 pens.
   - Total cost for pens = \( 2 \times 0.25 = 0.50 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the calculator:**
   - The calculator costs $12.
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 calculator.
   - Total cost for the calculator = \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of the geometry set:**
   - The geometry set costs $10.
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 geometry set.
   - Total cost for the geometry set = \( 1 \times 10 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items before the discount:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 10\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.10 \times 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = 20.00 - 2.00 = 18.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Daniel has to spend **18.00 dollars** on all the items he wants to buy."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water, and then calculate the difference in time for swimming 3 miles in each condition.

1. **Time to swim a mile in cold water:**
   Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water.

2. **Time to swim a mile in warm water:**
   The problem states that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. 
   - Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

3. **Time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   Since it takes 16 minutes to swim a mile, it will take \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles in cold water.

4. **Time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   Since it takes 34 minutes to swim a mile, it will take \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles in warm water.

5. **Difference in time for 3 miles between warm and cold water:**
   The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total. Out of these, 7 buttons have two holes each. So, the number of holes in these 7 buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]

The rest of the buttons have four holes each. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

The number of holes in these 14 buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Adding the holes from both types of buttons gives us the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} \]

Given that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} \]

Substituting the volume of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is:

"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact number of cups Juan must reduce, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in cups of coffee that Juan must make is \( 5R - 4 \).

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume \( R \) is given or can be determined, the reduction would be \( 5R - 4 \).

If we assume \( R = 8 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, if \( R = 8 \), Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

Since the problem does not specify \( R \), the final answer in terms of \( R \) is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information provided:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(130 \times 2 = 260\) pounds.

Now, we can calculate the average weight of the three friends. The average weight is the total weight of the three friends divided by 3.

The total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob is \(150 + 130 + 260 = 540\) pounds.

The average weight is \(\frac{540}{3} = 180\) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour upward from the pyramid.

First, calculate the total upward movement of the sun in degrees over 10 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find the angle from the ground to the sun. Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground. After moving 50 degrees upward, the angle from the ground to the sun can be found using the tangent function in a right triangle where the angle is the angle from the ground to the sun, the opposite side is the upward movement (50 degrees), and the adjacent side is the original angle from the ground (32 degrees).

The tangent of the angle from the ground to the sun is:
\[ \tan(\theta) = \frac{50}{32} \]

To find the angle \(\theta\), we take the arctangent of the ratio:
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{50}{32}\right) \]

Using a calculator to find the arctangent:
\[ \theta \approx \arctan(1.5625) \approx 57.46^\circ \]

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is approximately:
\[ \boxed{57.46} \]"
"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we calculate the total number of candles needed. Since James needs a candle for each son, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[

\]

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- Shiloh's current age as \( S \).
- His nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

So, in 7 years:
- Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).
- His nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given about Richie.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we first need to calculate the amount of money Mitchell made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made \(\boxed{21}\) more dollars than Liam."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday through Wednesday and the number of plastic action figures he will buy from Thursday through Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can find out how much he spends each day by dividing his total money by 4:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{4} = 17.5
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he can buy is:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{17.5}{5} = 3.5
\]

Since Peter can only buy whole action figures, he can buy 3 wooden action figures. The cost for 3 wooden action figures is:

\[
3 \times 5 = 15
\]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining money is:

\[
70 - 15 = 55
\]

Next, we calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy from Thursday through Sunday. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{55}{2} = 27.5
\]

Again, since Peter can only buy whole action figures, he can buy 27 plastic action figures. The cost for 27 plastic action figures is:

\[
27 \times 2 = 54
\]

After buying the plastic action figures, the remaining money is:

\[
55 - 54 = 1
\]

Since he has $1 left and each action figure costs $2, he cannot buy any more action figures with the remaining $1.

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
3 \text{ (wooden)} + 27 \text{ (plastic)} = 30
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten so far, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks):
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month by subtracting the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

Thus, the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of months in 2 years.
2. Determine the total amount of money removed from the account over these months.
3. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients:
- The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they need to make 10 sandwiches, they will use 1 loaf of bread.
- The cost of the bread is $3.00.
- The cost of the cheeses and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- So, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

Thus, the net profit is:
\[ \boxed{37} \]"

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffin crayons} \]

If Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50, then the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = 2592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \boxed{11232} \]"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
\[ \frac{330}{7} = 47.14285714285714 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is:
\[ 47.14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 47.14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: The first operation is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{First Operation} = S + \frac{S}{2}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \text{First Operation} = 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The result of the first operation is then divided by 5:
   \[
   \text{Second Operation} = \frac{\text{First Operation}}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: The result of the second operation is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   \text{Third Operation} = \text{Second Operation} \times (S - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is consistently off by 4%. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( T \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be \( T + 0.04T = 1.04T \). We know this should equal 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04T = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the durations of the movies together.

First, convert the duration of the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 30 minutes = 30 minutes
- Total for the first movie = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

Next, convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours = 120 minutes
- 5 minutes = 5 minutes
- Total for the second movie = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

"To determine the value of Juan's house and the combined value of both houses, we start by calculating the price of Juan's house. We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, which was paid $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, we subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the prices of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy initially bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy initially bought. Since Judy bought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
- Judy initially bought 12 cups.
- Her friend brought 40 cups.
- Total cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\).

Total dishes brought:
- Judy initially bought 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 44 dishes.
- Total dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Finally, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 + 68 = 120 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes with the discount:**
   - The original price of one box is $100.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is \( 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \).
   - The discounted price per box is \( 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \).
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is \( 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes:**
   - Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
   - Therefore, 2 boxes contain \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) contacts.
   - Since each pair consists of 2 contacts, the total number of pairs is \( \frac{180}{2} = 90 \).

3. **Calculate the cost per pair of contacts:**
   - The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00.
   - The total number of pairs is 90.
   - The cost per pair is \( \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \).

Thus, the cost per pair of contacts is \(\boxed{2.00}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \).

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans.
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans.
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
2. \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)
3. \( R + B + G = 4500 \)

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the total number of jelly beans equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

Finally, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in total costs between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. We can represent the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as:
\[ \text{Height on day } n = 4 \times 2^{n-1} \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the height exceeds 20 feet:
\[ 4 \times 2^{n-1} > 20 \]

First, divide both sides of the inequality by 4:
\[ 2^{n-1} > 5 \]

Next, we need to find the smallest integer \( n-1 \) such that \( 2^{n-1} > 5 \). We can check the powers of 2:
\[ 2^2 = 4 \]
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]

Since \( 2^2 = 4 \) is less than 5 and \( 2^3 = 8 \) is greater than 5, we have:
\[ n-1 = 3 \]
\[ n = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - The cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total protein intake per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
42

"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, the final numerical answer is 69."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:
- Total legs from dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Total legs from birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Finally, we sum the total number of legs from all the pets:
\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract this from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday:**
   Howard spends $8 at the arcade.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Monday} = \$8
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Tuesday} = 2 \times \$8 = \$16
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Howard spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Spent on Wednesday} = 4 \times \$16 = \$64
   \]

Next, we sum the amounts spent over the three days:
\[
\text{Total spent} = \$8 + \$16 + \$64 = \$88
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from Howard's initial amount of $100 to find out how much money he has left:
\[
\text{Money left} = \$100 - \$88 = \$12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rotations the tires will undergo over the course of Jeremy's driving and then calculate how many years this will take.

First, we calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo in one month:
- Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
- For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
- Therefore, for 400 miles, the tires will rotate \( \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \) times.

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
- Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
- The tires rotate 145,000 times per month.
- Therefore, the number of months required is \( \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \) months.

Finally, we convert the number of months into years:

"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash to cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

The total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% off sale.

The discount amount on the shirt is:

\[ 8 \text{ basketballs} \times \$14 \text{ per basketball} = \$112 \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ \$112 - \$27 = \$85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"To determine how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed based on the given fraction.

First, calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate the number of bloomed flowers:
\[ \text{Number of bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Given:
- Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s.
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb.

So, the speed in Mb/s is:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, to find the speed in Mb per hour, we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Total cost paid by the company} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we calculate the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Total cost paid by the company} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

   - Given that only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
   - There are 100 riders.
   - Number of riders who can stay upright = \( 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \).

2. **Calculate the number of these riders who are women.**
   - Of the 25 riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
   - Number of women = \( 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \).

3. **Calculate the number of these riders who are men.**
   - The remaining riders are men.
   - Number of men = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women.
   - Number of men = \( 25 - 15 = 10 \).

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

   \[
   \text{Price of a diamond jewel} = \$2000
   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob, given their respective speeds.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is at most $10.

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{C}{n} \]

We need:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time period:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid time = Total time - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs for the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the first hour + Cost of the second hour + Cost of the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is $105."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since each deviled egg is made from 2 halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book if he reads 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is given by the total number of pages divided by the number of pages he reads per day:

\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading. This is calculated by subtracting the total number of days required from the deadline:

\[
\text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane and the annual expenses:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep and each goose has one head, we have:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

2. The total number of animal legs is 70. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so we have:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[ s + g = 20 \]
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We can solve this system step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have:
\[ s + g = 20 \]
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( g \):
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( s \) is 15. To find the number of geese \( g \), we substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive coffee:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day:
\[ \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee:
\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

Gus bought:
- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\)
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total amount spent on the other items from the total amount spent:
\[20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7.00}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the basketball court.

Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ \text{Total time spent sleeping} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they share equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy.

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together.

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these up:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining 6 days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The next three days are: Good, Neutral, Good

Adding these to the existing counts:
- Good days: \(12 + 2 = 14\)
- Bad days: \(8\) (unchanged)
- Neutral days: \(10 + 1 = 11\) (since one neutral day is already counted)

The total number of days is still 30, and the counts are consistent.

Finally, we need to find the number of good days left in the month:
\[
\text{Total good days} = 14
\]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.
   - Each dog needs one toy.
   - Therefore, James needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has 4 toys + 8 toys = 12 toys.
   - There are now 4 original dogs + 8 new dogs = 12 dogs.
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James still needs 12 more toys.

3. **Second Visit:**
   - James went back to see that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs means 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs.
   - Therefore, there are now 12 original dogs + 24 new dogs = 36 dogs.
   - James needs 36 toys to have one toy per dog.

4. **Third Visit:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - Therefore, there are now 36 original dogs - 3 gone dogs = 33 dogs.

3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \).
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \).

First, we can substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the second equation:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, we can find the number of cookies Summer has using the third equation:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can set up the following equation to represent the final length of the dress:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the times into minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken for each half is:
- Time for the first half in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes
- Time for the second half in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes

Now, we sum the times for both halves:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. **Total time available for walking to school:** 30 minutes.
2. **Time taken to get to the corner where the library is:** 6 minutes.
3. **Time taken to get to the fire station from the corner:** 13 minutes.

First, we calculate the total time spent walking so far:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = 1 kilo * $4/kilo = $4.

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of **$14**."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Then, we account for the cookies that Greta and Celinda eat. They eat 10 cookies, so we subtract these from the total:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of the twins as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), and the ages of the triplets as \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express this relationship as:
\[ T_1 = P_i + 7 \]
for some triplet \( P_i \).

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets is 44:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the twins are twins, they are the same age:
\[ T_1 = T_2 \]

Substituting \( T_1 \) for \( T_2 \) in the combined ages equation, we get:
\[ T_1 + T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2T_1 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

We also know that one of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets. Let's assume \( T_1 = P_i + 7 \). Then we can substitute \( T_1 \) in the equation:
\[ 2(P_i + 7) + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_i + 14 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]
\[ 2P_i + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]

Since \( P_1, P_2, \) and \( P_3 \) are the ages of the triplets, and they must be positive integers, we need to find values that satisfy this equation. Let's assume \( P_i = 5 \) (a reasonable guess to simplify the equation):
\[ 2(5) + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]
\[ 10 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 30 \]
\[ P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find three positive integers that sum to 20. Let's choose \( P_1 = 6 \), \( P_2 = 6 \), and \( P_3 = 8 \):
\[ 6 + 6 + 8 = 20 \]

So, if \( P_i = 5 \), then:
\[ T_1 = P_i + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time John has before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the five lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Now, determine the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Next, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

Then, calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years.
4. Sum the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.**

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

**Step 2: Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month.**

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[
20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years.**

There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Rong saves:
\[
20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Neil saves:
\[
28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

**Step 4: Sum the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.**

The total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil is:
\[
2400 + 3360 = 5760
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + H \]

Since \( H = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( H \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[
\text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges cost three times as much as a banana:
\[
\text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is:
\[
5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is:
\[
12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is:
\[
7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that they raise an equal amount in every hour.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:

- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $49.00 - $4.90 = $44.10

So, Marcus' total bill is $44.10."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

With $6.00, the number of sets of 2 scoops she can buy is:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

So, she can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, which means she gets:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Additionally, for each set of 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 scoop free. Since she bought 2 sets, she gets:
\[ 2 \text{ free scoops} \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops she can get is:
\[ 4 \text{ scoops bought} + 2 \text{ free scoops} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over the two-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

The fixed fee is $20.
The variable fee is $1.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the variable cost is:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the fixed and variable costs gives the total cost James paid:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars} + 45 \, \text{dollars} = 65 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza had 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 40 + 27 = 67 \]

Since the total number of slices ordered was 60, the number of slices left is:
\[ 60 - 67 = -7 \]

However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of slices left, it indicates that the friends ate more slices than were available. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that all slices were eaten and there are no slices left. The number of slices left is:
\[ 0 \]

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

"To determine the number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]
Since each car has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed from the students' cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]
Since each car has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we add the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"To determine the percentage of blue spools of thread, we first need to calculate the total number of spools of thread Candy has. We do this by summing up all the spools:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} = 150 \text{ spools}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools, which includes both light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
\]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now, calculate the percentage:

\[
\left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of blue spools of thread is:

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we can calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight for the math and science books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books to find the total weight Cindy is carrying:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each person has is updated as follows:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the transaction:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."

   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - Therefore, \( 2S = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Steven has 10 books.

2. **Determine Alice's number of books:**
   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
   - Therefore, \( A = S + 6 \).
   - Substituting \( S = 10 \):
     \[
     A = 10 + 6 = 16
     \]
   - Alice has 16 books.

3. **Calculate the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has:**
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Alice has 16 books.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 - 16 = 4
     \]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{98}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students like to play video games. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote:
- \( V \) as the number of students who like to play video games.
- \( M \) as the number of students who like to play music.

According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting \( M = 10 \) into the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many birds were scared away by Jeremy throwing the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of that number. 

To find \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:
\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]"
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(2 + 3 = 5\).
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(5 \times 3 = 15\).
4. Mara ate 2 slices. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(15 - 2 = 13\).
5. Her friend stole 5 slices. So, the number of slices on the plate became \(13 - 5 = 8\).

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week.

The total number of animals is:
\[ 8 \text{ (dogs)} + 5 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (birds)} + 12 \text{ (horses)} = 28 \text{ animals} \]

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ animals}}{7 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ animals per day} \]

So, the number of animals Melissa will groom each day of the week is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards, each costing $1800.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

"To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   - Original cost per tomato: $0.50
   - New cost per tomato: $0.40
   - Savings per tomato: $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10
   - Number of tomatoes sold per day: 500
   - Daily savings: $0.10 * 500 = $50

2. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   - Number of days in a week: 7
   - Weekly savings: $50 * 7 = $350

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 a week.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Sean has:**
   Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has}
   \]
   Solving for the number of marbles Cal has:
   \[
   \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 equal groups. Therefore, the question implies that the activity cannot be divided into 12 groups with equal numbers of students in each group.

The number of additional groups needed to form, given that 12 groups are not possible, is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the weekly rental for weekdays and weekends:
- Weekdays: 5 days a week, 60 chairs rented each day.
  \[
  5 \text{ days/week} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 300 \text{ chairs/week}
  \]
- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.
  \[
  2 \text{ days/week} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 200 \text{ chairs/week}
  \]

Next, we add the weekday and weekend rental numbers to get the total weekly rental:
\[
300 \text{ chairs/week} + 200 \text{ chairs/week} = 500 \text{ chairs/week}
\]

Now, we calculate the total rental for one 4-week month:
\[
500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2000 \text{ chairs}
\]

Since we are considering two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one month by 2:
\[
2000 \text{ chairs/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 4000 \text{ chairs}
\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas: \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas. So, Gunther was left with \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas: \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.
4. Arnold stole another 12 bananas: \( 49 - 12 = 37 \) bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas: \( 37 + 6 = 43 \) bananas.

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers are worth \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 20 + 60 = 80 \)

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{XS} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   \[
   \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9

"To calculate the amount you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to determine the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the amount you will pay after the discount is $133."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]
   - So, Ahmed read 150 books.

2. **Calculate Total Books Read by Ezra:**
   - Ezra initially read 300 books.
   - Ezra decided to read 150 more books.
   - Total books read by Ezra:
     \[
     300 + 150 = 450
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Books Read by Both:**
   - Ahmed read 150 books.
   - Ezra read 450 books.
   - Total books read by both:
     \[
     150 + 450 = 600
     \]

Thus, the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5/\text{day} = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$365 \]"

The company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents each by the end of the day.

First, calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

Next, calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of vanilla scents sold is 3 more than the number of fruity scents sold.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"To determine the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours available over the weekend.
2. Determine the time spent on reading.
3. Calculate the remaining time after reading.
4. Determine the time spent on video games.
5. Calculate the time spent on soccer.
6. Convert the time spent on soccer into a percentage of the total weekend hours.

Let's start with the total number of hours available over the weekend:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Tatiana spends 3 hours reading:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

After reading, she plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on soccer:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the time spent on soccer into a percentage of the total weekend hours:
\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. The remaining pencils are 25, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time spent driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving one way is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent driving is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \] wheels.

Thus, the number of wheels left is \(\boxed{276}\)."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. A 20% discount on a $1000 laptop means we subtract 20% of $1000 from the original price.

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price you have to pay.

\[ \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is $800."
"First, let's determine the number of movies in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

This means the number of non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the non-series movies are older movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

This means the number of non-series movies that are not older movies is:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies that are not older} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we can calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

The cost of the older non-series movies is:

\[ \text{Cost of older non-series movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

The cost of the non-series movies that are not older is:

\[ \text{Cost of non-series movies that are not older} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"To calculate how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to multiply the number of pounds of each type of fruit by their respective prices and then sum the totals.

For peaches:
6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00

For plums:
8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00

For apricots:
6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Now, we add the totals for each type of fruit:
$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by both driving and hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance driven. The family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the distance hiked. The family hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. First, we find half of the driving speed:
\[ \text{Half of the driving speed} = \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Then, we find the hiking speed:
\[ \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Now, we calculate the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[ \boxed{330} \]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can express these relationships as:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \) (since they finish 4 seconds slower, they get 30 points for every second left on the timer)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each player:
- Ava's total points: \( 10 \times 8 + 5 \times 3 + 1680 = 80 + 15 + 1680 = 1775 \)
- Emma's total points: \( 10 \times 0 + 5 \times 0 + 1680 = 1680 \)

The difference in their scores is:
\[ 1775 - 1680 = 95 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Four Pizzas**: The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. **Cost of Two Pizzas**: Two of the pizzas cost $30 each. Therefore, the total cost for these two pizzas is:
   \[
   30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the Other Two Pizzas**: The remaining cost for the other two pizzas is:
   \[
   64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost per Pizza for the Other Two**: Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify this solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding these fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish (16) is indeed twice the number of white fish (8).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy drives from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - For 5 days, the total distance driven is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of fuel consumed:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - Therefore, the amount of fuel consumed for 50 miles is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming **$15** per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters to the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount spent for lunch:

\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, we find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school has decided to cover half of the cost, so the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.
3. John has $50.

Now, we need to find out how much more money John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost after the school's contribution:

\[ \text{Remaining cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{School's contribution} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]

\[ \text{Money John still needs} = \text{Remaining cost} - \text{Money John has} = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

So, John is missing $100.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be overcome to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees, we calculate the temperature difference needed to reach 32 degrees:

\[ 45 - 32 = 13 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we know that each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 13 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 2.6 \text{ logs} \]

Since Carson cannot burn a fraction of a log, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to burn 3 logs to ensure the temperature does not fall below 32 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. So, we calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells:

\[
\text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for her regular hours and her additional hours.

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours on that day. Since her regular workday is 8 hours, she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Now, we calculate the payment for her regular hours and her additional hours separately.

For the 8 regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

For the 3 additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the payments for the regular hours and the additional hours to find the total payment for the day:

"To determine how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discounted price of the jeans is:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Mike will have left after buying the jeans. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the discounted price from $50:

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (3).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"
"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total duration of singing both ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice.
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Deck the Halls""} = 2 \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once.
- Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Jingle Bells""} = 1 \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:

\[
\text{Total caroling time} = 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is:

\[
\boxed{540 \text{ seconds}}

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's calculate Billy's hourly wage and his earnings for 20 hours.

1. **Initial Hourly Wage:**
   - Billy's initial hourly wage is $10.

2. **First Raise:**
   - After 2 months, Billy's hourly wage increases by $0.50, so his new hourly wage is:
     \[
     10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

3. **Second Raise:**
   - On his first anniversary, his hourly wage increases by another $1.00, so his new hourly wage is:
     \[
     10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

4. **Billy's Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - For the first 2 months (20 hours), his wage is $10 per hour:
     \[
     20 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the next 20 hours (after the first raise), his wage is $10.50 per hour:
     \[
     20 \text{ hours} \times 10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 210 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the final 20 hours (after the second raise), his wage is $11.50 per hour:
     \[
     20 \text{ hours} \times 11.50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 230 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total earnings for 60 hours:
     \[
     200 + 210 + 230 = 640 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Sally's hourly wage and her earnings for 20 hours.

1. **Sally's Starting Hourly Wage:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial hourly wage:
     \[
     10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Sally's Earnings for 20 Hours:**
   - Since Sally's hourly wage is the same as Billy's after the first raise, her earnings for 20 hours are:
     \[
     20 \text{ hours} \times 10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 210 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, let's determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally.

1. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - Billy's total earnings: $640
   - Sally's total earnings: $210
   - Difference:
     \[
     640 - 210 = 430 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Billy will earn \(\boxed{430}\) dollars more than Sally."
"To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and the total cost of 2 bagels, and then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. Calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 loaf of bread} = \$2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 loaves of bread} = 3 \times \$2 = \$6
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost of 2 bagels:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 bagel} = \$1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 bagels} = 2 \times \$1 = \$2
   \]

3. Find the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Cost of 3 loaves of bread} - \text{Cost of 2 bagels} = \$6 - \$2 = \$4
   \]

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it.

Pierson's score = 278 points

Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139 points

Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150 points

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150 = 428 points

The final numerical answer is 428."
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of students in the school:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

Now, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Finally, let's find the total number of trees planted by adding the trees planted by the students and the trees planted by the teachers:
- The total number of trees planted is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

The final numerical answer is:
1240"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. Therefore, the number of stuffed goats \( x \) should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100:
\[ 100x = 30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ 100x = 420 + 30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 30x \) from both sides:
\[ 70x = 420 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 70:
\[ x = \frac{420}{70} = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she has played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she has played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the number of miles that will separate the two cars is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- For third graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%
- For fourth graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%
- For fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed:

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \)

Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 680 \)

Total number of students tested: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is then calculated as:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.68 \times 100 = 68\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 68\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 68 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Order and Sales**: Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150 of them. Since he can't sell more than he has, he would have sold out of his initial order and would have 0 candies left from that order.

2. **Additional Order**: After selling out of the initial 100 candies, Dale ordered 100 more candies. This means he now has 100 candies from the new order.

3. **Total Candies**: Adding the candies from the new order to the remaining candies from the initial order, Dale now has a total of 100 candies.

4. **Candies to Sell**: Dale needs to sell all 100 candies he currently has to sell all of his candy.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell **0** candies to sell all of his candy.

"To determine the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then find the difference from the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students at the beginning of the year:** 10 students.

2. **Number of students at the end of each month:**
   - **End of January:** The number of students doubles from the beginning of the year.
     \[
     10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of February:** The number of students doubles from the end of January.
     \[
     20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of March:** The number of students doubles from the end of February.
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of April:** The number of students doubles from the end of March.
     \[
     80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of May:** The number of students doubles from the end of April.
     \[
     160 \times 2 = 320 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Number of additional students by the end of May:**
   - Number of students at the end of May: 320
   - Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
   - Additional students:
     \[
     320 - 10 = 310

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original bag contained 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total playtime and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the playtime for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
  \[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
  \[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
  \[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total playtime for all four friends:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes (Jack)} + 10 \text{ minutes (friend 1)} + 30 \text{ minutes (friend 2)} + 10 \text{ minutes (friend 3)} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for a total of 240 minutes, we need to determine how many 70-minute blocks fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240}{70} \approx 3.43 \]

Since they can only play in full 70-minute blocks, they can play for 3 full blocks:
\[ 3 \times 70 = 210 \text{ minutes} \]

The remaining playtime is:
\[ 240 - 210 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the number of quarters used for the 210 minutes:
\[ \frac{210}{20} = 10.5 \]

Since Jack and his friends can only use whole quarters, they will use 11 quarters for the 210 minutes.

Next, we calculate the number of quarters used for the remaining 30 minutes:
\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \]

Again, since they can only use whole quarters, they will use 2 quarters for the remaining 30 minutes.

Adding these together, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 11 + 2 = 13 \]

Thus, the total amount of money used is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = 2C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( \frac{S}{2} \) in the equation for fragrance:
\[ F = \frac{S}{2} \]

Now, we know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total mixture equation:
\[ S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + S = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + S = 10 \]
\[ S + 2S + S = 10 \]
\[ 4S = 10 \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil \( O \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Thus, the total amount of money John spent is:

\[
\boxed{4500}

\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide $125,000 by 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she spent walking each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. 

Next, we are told that on the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she spent walking on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to convert the total time spent walking over the two days from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

The total time spent walking in hours is:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}
\]"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot at the start of the lunch break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he noticed that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]
4. **Cars Remaining During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, calculate the daily earnings:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.

   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00
   \]

So, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars if he works a full 7-day week."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs:
\[ 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the refund amount from Amazon. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the net loss by subtracting the refund amount from the shipping cost:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the negative value indicates a loss, the amount of money Milly will lose is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has before making any purchases. She starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100.

\[
40 + 100 = 140
\]

Next, we need to account for the cost of the items she buys. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20.

The cost of the two pairs of jeans is:

\[
2 \times 30 = 60
\]

Adding the cost of the bag:

\[
60 + 20 = 80
\]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount of money Mulan had initially.

\[
140 - 80 = 60
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is:
\[
\boxed{14000}

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \( 72 \times 4 = 288 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \( 120 \times 4 = 480 \) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, the time spent on makeup is \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \( 90 \times 4 = 360 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{1128}{60} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{18.8} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost of the installation:
- The base cost is $129.00.

Next, we need to calculate the additional cost for the items Angela needs:
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

The cost for the additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, we calculate the cost for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures:
- Cost for 6 mirrors: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars
- Cost for 2 chandeliers: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
- Cost for 20 pictures: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars

Now, we sum up the additional costs:
\[90 + 30 + 300 = 420\] dollars

Finally, we add the base cost to the additional cost to find the total cost:
\[129 + 420 = 549\] dollars

"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{42.00}

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the second part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to complete the journey.

First, let's establish the relationship between the number of kangaroos and the time it takes for them to travel across the highway. We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance. If we let \( D \) be the distance across the highway, and \( v \) be the speed of each kangaroo, then the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). Let \( t \) be the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \). The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t \]
\[ D = 2vt \]

Since the distance \( D \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]
\[ 54 = 2t \]
\[ t = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ t = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by identifying the number of dishes each person made based on the information provided.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Rory's Dishes:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, we calculate Rory's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Dishes:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, we calculate Jada's dishes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Dishes:**
   To find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we sum the dishes each person made:
   \[
   \text{Total dishes} = \text{Jada's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Kora's dishes} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
   \]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = \text{total money} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total money she has is $400 - $50 = $350. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently.
2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters.
3. Calculate how many more cows are required to produce the additional milk needed.

First, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

Next, the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into this equation, we get \( 60 = 2S \), which means \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so together Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so together Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we need to consider those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the total number of students good at math is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The annual interest rate \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) percent per year,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ I = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 675 \]
\[ I = 202500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 202500 \]
\[ A = 202800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{202800} \]"

"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Sum the remaining goats from both farms.

First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm:
- From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Next, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm:
- The number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- The number of goats left in Farm Y is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we sum the remaining goats from both farms:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- However, you get a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

2. Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms: Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required to clean 45 rooms is \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, the number of hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms is 15 hours."
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. In the third year, the town builds double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   Then, the number of homes built in the third year is:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144
\]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( S \) be my age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( B = S + 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( S = M - 2 \).
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( S + B + M = 87 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[ M = 3(S + 3) - 1 = 3S + 9 - 1 = 3S + 8. \]

Next, we substitute \( M \) and \( B \) in terms of \( S \) into the fourth equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (3S + 8) = 87. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ S + S + 3 + 3S + 8 = 87, \]
\[ 5S + 11 = 87. \]
Subtract 11 from both sides:
\[ 5S = 76. \]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[ S = \frac{76}{5} = 15.2. \]

Since age is typically expressed as a whole number, and given the context of the problem, it seems there might be a need to recheck the problem constraints or assumptions, but based on the given equations and the arithmetic, the age of the person is:
\[ \boxed{15.2} \]

However, typically in such problems, ages are whole numbers, so there might be a need to re-evaluate the problem constraints or assumptions."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the given changes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water After the First Day:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Amount of Water After the Second Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges Claire earns in a year:
- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges in a year.

Next, let's determine how long it takes Amber to earn a badge:
- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.
- Claire takes 1 month to earn a badge.
- Therefore, Amber takes \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \) months to earn a badge.

Now, let's calculate how many badges Amber earns in a year:
- Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges in a year.

Finally, let's determine how many badges Wendy earns in a year:
- Wendy earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns.
- Claire earns 12 badges in a year.
- Therefore, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges in a year.

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns:
- Wendy earns 36 badges.
- Amber earns 6 badges.
- The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the banana bread slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.**
Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the banana bread slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ \text{Gold coins} = \text{Silver coins} + 30 \]

Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = \text{Gold coins} + \text{Silver coins} \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, so the difference is:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is given as $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have left after selling the rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total revenue from selling the rope is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah will use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

The amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope is:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age first. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Kelly is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bacon} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since each pack of bacon costs $10, each pack of chicken costs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so the total cost of chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, each pack of apples costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 196 = -131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the items. She is short by:
\[
\boxed{131}
\]"
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we need to break down the information given:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
2. The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
3. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

First, we need to find the runtime of the part of the final concert that is not the encore. We subtract the encore time from the total runtime of the final concert:

\[ 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

This 50 minutes represents the part of the final concert that is twice the length of her usual concert. Let's denote the usual concert runtime by \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, so:

\[ 2x = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the original number of toys he had.

Initially, Argo has 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

First, we calculate the total number of toys given away:
\[ 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:
\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys left.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

1. On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

\[
\boxed{500}

"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we first need to calculate how many microphones were left without a pair.

Given that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, we can calculate the number of microphones that won't be paired as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, the number of birds flying overhead is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
3. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, the number of birds feeding is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we can add up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

\[
\boxed{34}

"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of flowering plants:**
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   \[

"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

First, let's identify the cost of the items Ellen consumes daily:
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the salad and the yogurt:
\[ \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \$6 + \$3 = \$9 \]

Ellen's total daily expenditure is $11. Therefore, the cost of the two carrots she eats every day is:
\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} = \$11 - \$9 = \$2 \]

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\$2}{2} = \$1 \]

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6. Since she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the payment for mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's lawn and the other lawns:
\[ 6x + 6x = 12x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 12x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 12x = 12 \times 1 = 12 \]

The earnings from lemonade sales is the total earnings minus the earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 80 - 12 = 68 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 74 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so his profit is:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we start by calculating the distance Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the distance Dijana rowed gives us the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance rowed on that day:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read by Denise today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, so Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

3. **Total pages read by Denise:**
   - Yesterday: 10 pages
   - Today: 18 pages
   - Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

4. **Total pages read by Daniel:**
   - Yesterday: 13 pages
   - Today: 0 pages
   - Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:**
   - Denise read 28 pages.

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. This leaves 3 adult's bowls of soup. We need to determine how many child's bowls these 3 adult's bowls can fill.

Since 4 adult's bowls are equivalent to 8 child's bowls, 3 adult's bowls are equivalent to:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Calvin's adult wife and their two children will each eat one bowl of soup. This means there are 3 bowls of soup left (one for Calvin's wife and two for the children).

We already calculated that 3 adult's bowls are equivalent to 6 child's bowls. Since there are 3 child's bowls left, each child can have one bowl of soup. Therefore, each child can have one bowl of soup for lunch.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To calculate the total amount William spent, we need to multiply the cost of the notebooks by the number of notebooks he bought and then add the cost of the ballpen.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen. So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).

Now, we calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Material for 20 small masks = \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Material for 8 large masks = \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

The total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is \( 16 \) yards."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies that Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total amount of time he spends on various activities and then subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours. Therefore, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. However, Joseph lost 2 of his books. Therefore, the number of books Joseph currently has is:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean has 30 marbles and he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Now, let's calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving 6 to Jamie:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. We subtract these 10 marbles from the 24 marbles he has left:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[
14
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
14

"To solve this problem, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( 52 = 2(A - 4) \).

We need to solve for \( A \) first:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
1. Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.
2. Adding 100 acres to this gives \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Next, to find the total number of acres for both farms together:
1. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
2. Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.
3. Adding these together gives \(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres.

\[
\boxed{700}

"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in total for the eight-hour workday, we multiply the total number of packages by the amount he earns per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink one bottle of water for each half-hour interval. Therefore, he will drink:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Thus, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, we need to determine the total distance Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, the total distance driven in a month is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups Jon will need. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance driven by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon will need 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing each sport and then sum them up.

1. **Tennis Players:**
   - There are 6 students playing tennis.

2. **Volleyball Players:**
   - The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of students playing tennis.
   - Number of volleyball players = \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

3. **Soccer Players:**
   - There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer.
   - Total number of soccer players = \( 16 + 22 = 38 \).

Now, we sum up the number of students playing each sport:
- Total number of students = Number of tennis players + Number of volleyball players + Number of soccer players
- Total number of students = \( 6 + 12 + 38 \)

Adding these together:
- Total number of students = \( 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \)

Thus, the total number of students is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students combined. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Adding these together:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, each row has \( 2x \) cups of tea.

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of tea in the rows is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

This means:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

So, in each row, there are \( x = 2 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( x = 2 \) cups of mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the total time for each trip is 4 hours, we can calculate the time spent on each part of the trip:
- Time spent picking berries = 4 hours (total trip time) - 2 hours (climbing up) = 2 hours.

Next, we need to determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
- Number of trips in 8 hours = 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips.

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of berries he picks up per trip:
- Number of berries per trip = 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip.

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10,000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from his total monthly budget of $150:
\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10. We need to find out how many tickets he can buy with $126:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{126}{10} \right\rfloor = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, which totals:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ movies} \]

Since he has $126 left and each ticket costs $10, he can see 12 more movies. Adding these to the 13 movies he has already seen:
\[ 13 + 12 = 25 \text{ movies} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins:
\[ \text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already had from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 \text{ (total toys now)} - 48 \text{ (toys before)} = 14 \text{ bouncy balls} \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"First, let's determine the initial number of water balloons each person had:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so each friend received \(2\) balloons.
- Maria herself received \(1\) water balloon.

So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding Maria's balloon:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons.

So, the total number of additional balloons given by her mom is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then calculate the revenue from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ \text{Remaining Money After Gas} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of Gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining Money After Bank Deposit} = \text{Remaining Money After Gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:

\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = \text{Number of Pencils} \times \text{Cost per Pencil} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining Money After Pencils} = \text{Remaining Money After Bank Deposit} - \text{Cost of Pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \text{Number of Pens} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money After Pencils}}{\text{Cost per Pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled out by Craig and his brother, we start by calculating the total number of letters Craig has spelled out.

Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the number of letters Craig spelled out to the number of letters his brother spelled out:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice she can get from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Fee**: Patty charges $40 for the visit.
2. **Labor Cost**: Patty charges $35 per hour for labor. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = 2.25 \times 35 = \$78.75
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts is given as $60.

Now, we sum up all these costs to find the total charge:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost} = \$40 + \$78.75 + \$60 = \$178.75
\]

Therefore, Patty charged \(\boxed{178.75}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for them:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time for initial swim} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time for remaining swim} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for initial swim} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time for remaining swim}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."
"First, let's determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery had based on the information provided.

We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ \text{Number of loaves in the bakery} = 7 \times (\text{Number of loaves Sam had}) - 40 \]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[ \text{Number of loaves in the bakery} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication and subtraction:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem with equations.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, substitute Deanna's age into the second equation to find Marcus's age:
\[ M = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Now, substitute Marcus's age into the first equation to find Leo's age:
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To solve for \( L \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
42"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \), by Bahati as \( B \), and by Dinar as \( D \).

According to the problem, Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored. This gives us the following relationships:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

Since the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, we have:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We can substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D + 20 = 45 \]
\[ 2A + D = 25 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the total points equation:
\[ (D + 10) + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + 2D + 10 = 45 \]
\[ A + 2D = 35 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 2:
\[ 4A + 2D = 50 \]

Now we subtract the second equation from this result:
\[ (4A + 2D) - (A + 2D) = 50 - 35 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. To find the points scored by Bahati and Dinar, we substitute \( A = 5 \) back into the equations:
\[ B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

We can verify the total points:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he worked and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours = 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes = 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can now calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Total reports stapled = 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Total sleep time**: Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time spent sleepwalking**: Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. The duration of sleepwalking is:
   \[
   2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time woke up early**: Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she woke up at:
   \[
   6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
   \]
   The time she was awake before waking up early is:
   \[
   5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 6:00 \text{ a.m.} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total time awake**: Adding the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early:
   \[
   23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time slept on the bed**: Subtracting the total time awake from the total sleep time:

"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. We know he has two dozen measuring cups, and since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons he has left:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the length of each episode.
2. Determine the total number of episodes.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Given:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

First, let's find the total number of episodes. Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can express this relationship mathematically:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Minutes per episode}}{2} \]

Substituting the given minutes per episode:
\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know there are 10 episodes. Each episode is 20 minutes long. To find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Minutes per episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. **Brownies made for herself:**
   Greta made one dozen brownies for herself.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies sent to her from the office party:**
   Greta received half a dozen brownies from her office party.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Brownies given to her by her friends:**
   Greta received four dozen brownies from her friends.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total brownies received:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies left over:**
   Subtracting the brownies eaten from the total brownies received:
   \[
   66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes this represents, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes of oranges. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 100 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S_{USA} \). Therefore, \( S_{USA} = 50 \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's denote the number of states in India as \( S_{India} \). Therefore, we can write the equation for \( S_{India} \) as:
\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} S_{USA} + 4 \]

Substituting the value of \( S_{USA} \):
\[ S_{India} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 + 4 \]
\[ S_{India} = 25 + 4 \]
\[ S_{India} = 29 \]

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S_{USA} + S_{India} \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 50 + 29 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

The final numerical answer is:

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**

"Let's denote Emil's current age as \( E \), his dad's current age as \( D \), and his brother's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E = 19 \)
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.

First, let's determine the age difference between Emil and his dad. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now (since \( 24 - 19 = 5 \)). At that time, his dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice the age of his brother. At that time, his brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old. According to the problem:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:
- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plants in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost per basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations, and then find out how much soil is left for the roses.

First, calculate the soil used by the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the soil used by the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtract the total soil used from the total soil available to find the remaining soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find out how many minutes it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
  \[
  \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30:
  \[
  \frac{90}{30} = 3
  \]
- Since each set of 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
  \[
  3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to sauté the shrimp:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling on low: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling on high: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the cooling and warming effects:
- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).

The net change in temperature is:
\[ 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the room is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the time interval between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

Now, we calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- The time interval between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
- Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

The final numerical answer is:
52"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Adam received from his parents and the amount he spent on the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents is:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the amount he spent on the trousers:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[A + B + H + W = 20\]
Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
This simplifies to:
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
So,
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]
According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
So,
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[\boxed{3}\]"
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

The total amount collected from these two sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"To determine how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.
3. Calculate the number of people in the church next door based on the number of cookies given.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.**

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.**

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door.
\[
\text{Cookies given to the church} = \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church next door.**

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.
\[
\text{Number of people in the church} = \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people}
\]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the proportion of the watermelon that each adult and each child gets, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Let the volume of each child's slice be \( x \). Then, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:

\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume of the watermelon \( V \) is equal to \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the watermelon each adult gets. Since there are 2 adults and each adult's slice is \( 2x \), the total volume of the slices for the adults is:

\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is:

\[ \frac{4x}{8x} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and there are 9 inpatients, so the total time spent on inpatients is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatients from minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

We also need to convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on inpatients and appointments gives us the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we subtract the 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter combined.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Adding these together gives:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, as well as the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Weeks in a Month**: Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the studio is rented for 4 * 3 = 12 sessions in a month.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Cost per Session} \times \text{Number of Sessions} = \$40 \times 12 = \$480. \]

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Now, we add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population of porcupines to find the total population after a year:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks.
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled. Using the same formula:

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:

- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that for the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after each hour, the power bank retains 91% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, meaning it retains 93% of its charge from the previous hour. So, after the next 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \times C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the left side of the equation:
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]
\[ 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

So, we have:
\[ 0.536 = 0.28 \]

This indicates that the initial charge \( C \) must be scaled to fit the given final charge. Since the equation holds true with the given values, we can conclude that the initial charge \( C \) is consistent with the problem's conditions. Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is:
\[ C = 1 \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank was:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.
3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.**

The cost of the car is $10000. Therefore, 20% of $10000 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2000.

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \times 40 + 15 \times 40 = 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, Janet earns $1000 per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000.**

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits he has already bought, he has:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

This means the number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Albums**: She divided these pictures into 8 albums.
3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 albums were for selfies only.
   - 2 albums were for portraits only.
   - The remaining albums were for other categories.

First, calculate the number of albums that were not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Next, we know that the 3 albums for other categories were equally distributed among selfies and portraits. Since there are 3 albums for other categories, and they are split equally between selfies and portraits:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ other albums}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ selfies albums} \]
\[ \frac{3 \text{ other albums}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ portraits albums} \]

However, since the number of albums must be whole numbers, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let's assume the problem meant to imply that the 3 other albums were split into 1.5 each, which is not possible in practical terms. Instead, let's assume the problem meant to imply that the 3 albums for other categories were split into 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1) for selfies and portraits.

Let's assume the split was 1 album for selfies and 2 albums for portraits (or vice versa):
\[ 1 \text{ album for selfies} \]
\[ 2 \text{ albums for portraits} \]

Now, calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
- Total selfies: \( 1 \text{ album} \times 8 \text{ pictures per album} = 8 \text{ selfies} \)
- Total portraits: \( 2 \text{ albums} \times 8 \text{ pictures per album} = 16 \text{ portraits} \)

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 8 \text{ selfies} + 16 \text{ portraits} = 24 \text{ portraits and selfies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). This means 30 new guests checked in.
5. After dinner was served, 7 more guests checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial guests: 100
- After 24 guests checked out early: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
- After 15 guests checked out late: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
- After 30 new guests checked in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
- After 7 more guests checked in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the current number of guests in the hotel is 98.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{number of large stuffed animals sold} \times \text{price of a large stuffed animal}) + (\text{number of small stuffed animals sold} \times \text{price of a small stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Add this to the 12 pounds: \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a day:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day:**
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of dwarves: \( 40 \times 18 = 720 \) pounds per day.

4. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of days: \( 720 \times 30 = 21600 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is \(\boxed{21600}\) pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price should be the same for all packages.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5. Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:

\[
\text{Cost of the package with 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after using the $1000 from selling his old bedroom set.

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000. Tom received $1000 from selling his old bedroom set, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

1. **Probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\) or 20%

2. **Probability that the normal teacher comes in but no extension is given:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of no extension: \(1 - 0.4 = 0.6\)
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.6 = 0.3\) or 30%

3. **Probability that the substitute teacher comes in:**
   - Probability of the substitute teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of available seats for guests is calculated as follows:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to split these 5750 available seats equally among the graduates. There are 950 graduates, so each graduate will receive:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}\).

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to go from one bottle to the next = 5 seconds.
   - Number of intervals = 7.

"To determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese she buys and then subtract this total from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \).

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of mozzarella cheese
- Total cost = \$22 + \$18 = \$40.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the $50 Amor started with to find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
- Money left = \$50 - \$40 = \$10.

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim took 4 years to finish college.
- He borrowed $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total amount borrowed is \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- He would have worked for 4 years.
- Therefore, the total income he would have earned is \( 4 \times 25,000 = 100,000 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During his college years, he would have earned $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total income he would have earned during college is \( 4 \times 50,000 = 200,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college, but instead worked the entire time:
- The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $100,000.
- The total income he would have earned during college is $200,000.
- Therefore, the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is \( 100,000 + 200,000 = 300,000 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school:
- The total amount of money Jim borrowed is $200,000.
- The total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college is $300,000.
- Therefore, the total amount of money Jim needs to earn is \( 200,000 + 300,000 = 500,000 \) dollars.

Since Jim earns $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college, we need to calculate how many years it would take to earn $500,000:
- The number of years required is \( \frac{500,000}{25,000} = 20 \) years.

Thus, it would take Jim 20 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. **Length of each piece of fabric:**
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Width of each piece of fabric:**
   \[
   8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}
   \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"

- Total cost for chicken salad = 10 * $6.50 = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6.00
- Total cost for pasta salad = 6 * $6.00 = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for both salads:
- Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"To determine how much Johnny lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Amount lost in the first race: $5
   - Twice the amount lost: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Therefore, Johnny lost $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - 1.5 times the amount won: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Therefore, Johnny lost $16.5 in the third race.

Next, we calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
\[
5 + 11 + 16.5 = 32.5
\]

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\frac{32.5}{3} = 10.8333\ldots
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average amount lost per race is:
\[
10.83
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10.83}

"To find the total population in South America, we need to calculate the total number of people living in all the cities combined.

Given:
- There are 26 countries in South America.
- Each country has 5 cities.
- Each city has 1000 people.

First, we calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[ \text{Total number of cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Number of cities per country} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cities} = 26 \times 5 = 130 \]

Next, we calculate the total population by multiplying the total number of cities by the population of each city:
\[ \text{Total population} = \text{Total number of cities} \times \text{Population per city} \]
\[ \text{Total population} = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000 \]

Therefore, the total number of people in South America is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.**

There are 3 weeks of work, and each week has 7 days. Therefore, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.**

Each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all painters in 21 days is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.**

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{\frac{63}{8} \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = \frac{63}{8 \times 4} \text{ hours/painter} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours/painter} \]

To convert this to a decimal:
\[ \frac{63}{32} \approx 1.96875 \text{ hours/painter} \]

Therefore, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{1.96875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The depreciation rate is 21% per year, which means the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price of the car at the end of each year:

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9,830.18."
"To determine the number of Spanish books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books:
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]

2. Calculate the number of German books:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to determine how far she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers over 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how much farther Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance.

\[
\text{Distance remaining} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km}
\]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the additional cost as follows:
\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this to the normal monthly cost gives the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads per week = 2 (twin beds) + 1 (king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all the cats.
2. Determine how many days the total amount of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much cat food the cats consume in one day. Since each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

With 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days 720 grams of cat food will last is:

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony is sending.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \) of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under the promotion:
- For the first 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the next 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.
- For the last 2 pounds, Dennis pays the full price.

The cost per pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the cost for each 2-pound segment is:
- \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to purchase 3 segments of 2 pounds each:
- Total cost = \( 3 \times \$8.00 = \$24.00 \)

Thus, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[

- Guests who could not come: 4
- Guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

The base rental fee for the theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. Since 41 guests are attending, we need to calculate the additional fee:

- Additional guests: 41 - 20 = 21
- Additional fee: 21 * $6 = $126

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party:

- Base rental fee: $125
- Additional fee: $126
- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{85}

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in one day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \left\lceil \frac{15}{12} \right\rceil = 2 \text{ dozens} \]
The cost for 2 dozens of roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she is short:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny needs to get the remaining $5 in change. Since the florist only has quarters (25 cents each) for change, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} = 5 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]
Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the number of quarters Jenny will receive is:
\[ \frac{500}{25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**

\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total money Terry makes is **162 dollars**."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

The total time Paul will wait for his train is \(\boxed{85}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - In 4 hours, one spring creates \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs would create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."

"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance from home to halfway point: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the first segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance from halfway point back to home: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for the second segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Third Segment:**

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each bunch costs $0.80.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Therefore, the total cost if bought individually is:
  \[
  10 \text{ bunches} \times \$0.80 \text{ per bunch} = \$8.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Therefore, the total cost if bought in bunches is:
  \[
  10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00
  \]

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings:
\[
\$30.00 - \$8.00 = \$22.00
\]

Thus, Jenny saved \(\boxed{22}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years by multiplying the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The final numerical answer is:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Number of Trekking bikes sold: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
   - Number of BMX bikes sold: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - Number of MTB bikes sold: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Price of one Trekking bike: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent in class each week is 1600 minutes.
   - The extra learning time is 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child's height in inches is:

The second child is two inches taller than the first child:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag, we first need to find out how many bags were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, and this amount is given as 270 kilograms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north and south walls, and two east and west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Number of shaken sodas left: 2
   - Total number of sodas left: 4
   - Probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda: \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)
   - \(0.5 \times 100\% = 50\%\)

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train.
   - Half of 60 miles per hour is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles.

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles.

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

Thus, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we need to calculate the total number of days he works and then multiply that by the number of people he can help per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to determine how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days Billy works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he can help per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Finally, the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works is:
\[ 40 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ people/day} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two quantities.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

\[
12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

Now, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[
420 + 60 = 480
\]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is \(\boxed{480}\)."

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of descent: 60 feet/minute

Time to ride the biggest slide:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of descent: 80 feet/minute

Time to ride the second biggest slide:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Next, we need to find out how much time this adds up to over 5 days:
- Total time over 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. 

The final numerical answer is:
5"

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.
5. Add the discounted costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.
6. The final result will be the new balance on her credit card.

Let's go through each step in detail:

3. Cost of the frying pan after a 20% discount:
   - Original price of the frying pan: $20.00
   - Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
   - Discounted price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels after a 10% discount:
   - Original price of the set of towels: $30.00
   - Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
   - Discounted price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Adding the discounted prices to the remaining balance:
   - Remaining balance after return: $70.00
   - Total cost of the frying pan and the set of towels: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
   - New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = \$20,000 \).

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary after retirement:
- Her current annual salary is $100,000.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current salary after retirement.
- Therefore, her annual living expenses after retirement will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = \$40,000 \).

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:
- She needs to save $40,000 per year for 20 years.
- Therefore, the total amount she needs to save is \( 40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000 \).

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000:
- She saves $20,000 per year.
- Therefore, the number of years she needs to work is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Thus, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \).

Since 40% of the total students are boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ N = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Megan = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior did laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Dior = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 8 hours = 12 hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 4 hours, we assume the minimum additional time is 4 hours, and the problem states ""well over"" so we take the minimum of 8 hours).

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, this distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we have:
\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2B \]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by all four workers in one 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all four workers in one shift is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys in one shift, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for a 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he gave away, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, we get \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we multiply both sides by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know from the problem that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]

"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can get is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's monthly salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's monthly salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Since she walks at a certain rate on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent walking on both segments:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks.

\[
4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[
60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[
\frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[
7

"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Number of marbles after losing 10} = 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the water in the other mug as \( T \) degrees.

After pouring, the temperature of the water in his water bottle is a weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. Since he poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the mug at temperature \( T \), the average temperature of the water in his water bottle is:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

According to the problem, this temperature must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}

"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then multiply by the number of days in three weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added per day:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added per day:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Now, let's determine the total number of days in three weeks:
- Three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of cows added over three weeks:
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Then, we calculate the total number of chickens added over three weeks:
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total number of cows and chickens added:
- Initial number of cows = 50 cows.
- Initial number of chickens = 20 chickens.

Total number of cows after three weeks:
- Total cows = Initial cows + Total cows added = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
- Total chickens = Initial chickens + Total chickens added = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
- Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final numerical answer is:
700"
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
   \[
   0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is the total cost after the discount divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the cost per bagel is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 1 less than 3 scoops is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days and then convert that into dozens, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert total eggs to dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of green jellybeans.
2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

First, we know that there are 17 green jellybeans. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans}) = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

Next, we are told that 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:
\[

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day and then extend that to 3 days.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - From the sunflower sales: Faraday earns $2 per sunflower.
   - From the bouquet sales: Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers, so the cost per sunflower from the bouquet is $8 / 12 = $2/3 per sunflower.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of sunflowers sold per day and \( y \) be the number of bouquets sold per day.
   - The total earnings from sunflowers per day is \( 2x = 26 \), so \( x = 13 \).
   - The total earnings from bouquets per day is \( \frac{2}{3}y = 56 \), so \( y = 56 \times \frac{3}{2} = 84 \).
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is \( 84 \times 12 = 1008 \).
   - Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is \( 13 + 1008 = 1021 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is \( 1021 \times 3 = 3063 \).

The final numerical answer is:
3063"

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first establish the probabilities of each ticket being a winner.

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket being a winner is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket being a winner. This is because the events are independent.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \), which simplifies to \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \), which simplifies to \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.**

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.**

Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.
\[ \text{Total cost} = (2 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.**

The total number of devices sold is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Isabel's height:**
   Isabel is 7 feet tall.

2. **Determine Ned's height:**
   Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine Carl's height:**
   Carl is one foot taller than Ned.
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the length of Carl's cane:**
   Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - If 1 person needs 5 bottles, then 2300 people would need \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, subtract the current production from the total required:
     \[
     11500 - 4200 = 7300
     \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce \(\boxed{7300}\) more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 66.67 \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of land sold:**
   - Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
   - He sold half of the land: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He then sold another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) square meters.
   - Therefore, the total area sold is \( 40 + 10 = 50 \) square meters.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the first sale:**
   - He sold 40 square meters for $50.
   - Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \times 50 = 2000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the revenue from the second sale:**
   - He sold 10 square meters for $30.
   - Revenue from the second sale: \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the remaining land and its value:**
   - Total land sold: 50 square meters.
   - Remaining land: \( 80 - 50 = 30 \) square meters.
   - He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   - Revenue from the remaining land: \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Revenue from the first sale: $2000.
   - Revenue from the second sale: $300.
   - Revenue from the remaining land: $90.
   - Total revenue: \( 2000 + 300 + 90 = 2390 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \(\boxed{2390}\) dollars."
"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age, so:

Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, for each day, he uses \(3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ masks/outing} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - Since he uses 6 face masks per day, in 2 days he will use \(6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Thus, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs that Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll determine how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we'll determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard by subtracting the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
2. Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.
3. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.
4. Calculate his weekly earnings based on the number of collections and the payment per collection.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.**

Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
\[ 200 \text{ apartments/complex} \times 2 \text{ complexes} = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined total of the first two complexes.
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ additional apartments} \]
\[ 400 \text{ apartments} + 240 \text{ apartments} = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex.
\[ 400 \text{ apartments/complex} \times 3 \text{ collections/week} = 1200 \text{ apartments/week} \]
\[ 640 \text{ apartments/complex} \times 3 \text{ collections/week} = 1920 \text{ apartments/week} \]
\[ 1200 \text{ apartments/week} + 1920 \text{ apartments/week} = 3120 \text{ apartments/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate his weekly earnings based on the number of collections and the payment per collection.**

John gets paid $0.40 per collection.
\[ 3120 \text{ apartments/week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars/apartment} = 1248 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2350}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we calculate:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) and the length of the red rope as \( R \). According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write:

\[ R = 4B \]

We are also given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The combined length of the red, blue, and yellow ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write:

\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:

\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope \( B \) is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope \( R \):

\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa was given as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so we have:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

This means Rissa was given $15. Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as \( N \). Since the problem does not specify the amount Ronnie was given, we can assume \( N = 5 \) based on the information given about Rissa's money.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of red paint used in the mural. Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal.
3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we can find the total area of the house by summing the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box of dishwasher pods, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12.
   - The new box contains 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles that can be run for $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

"First, we determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

- Number of girls in the class: 12
- Number of boys in the class: 12

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

- Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Finally, we find the total number of students not on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled by the dentist:**
   James' dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped by the dentist:**
   The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
   \[
   4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
   \[
   4 + 11 = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   To find the percentage of James' teeth that are fixed, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
   \]

"To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin is indeed 20 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books he can buy with $27,000 by dividing $27,000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

So, Bob can buy 54 books with $27,000. Since he is distributing this amount among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:

\[
\frac{54}{3} = 18
\]

Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school. The final numerical answer is:

\[
18

   - Apples put in pocket: 5 - 1 = 4
   - Apples on the ground: 5 - 1 = 4

4. **Fourth Apple**: Newton picked up the remaining apple and threw it at the tree.
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 4 + 1 = 5
   - Apples on the ground: 4 - 1 = 3

5. **Fifth Apple**: Newton picked up all the remaining apples (3 apples) and went home to make a pie.
   - Apples put in pocket: 3
   - Apples on the ground: 0

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 3.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices of each type of pizza that her friends eat.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices.

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required to meet this demand.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \div 12 = 3\) cheese pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \div 8 = 3\) pepperoni pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas and both types require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[3 + 3 = 6\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we need to determine Jim's age at that time.

Let's denote Jim's age when the show came out as \( J \). According to the information given, John's age at that time was \( 2J \). Since John is currently 28, the difference in their ages remains constant over time. Therefore, when the show came out, John was \( 28 - J \) years older than Jim.

Given that John was \( 2J \) years old when the show came out, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - J \]

To solve for \( J \), we add \( J \) to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3J = 28 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ J = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \]

Since age is typically expressed as a whole number, and considering the context of the problem, we can conclude that Jim was approximately 9 years old when the show came out. However, if we are to provide the exact numerical answer without rounding, it would be:

\[ J = \frac{28}{3} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{28}{3} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces.
2. Doxa ate 1 slice.
3. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
4. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:
- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 3 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Given that they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25 more, and they ended up with 78 bandages, it means they used 3 bandages more than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final numerical answer is:
62"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost for the color is $40.

Adding the cost of the haircut and the color, we get $60 + $40 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

The total hours she works in a week is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \]

The total pay for a week is:
\[ 45 \text{ hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total regular pay for April is:
\[ \$67.5/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. For 4 weeks, the total attendance bonus is:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40 \]

Adding the regular pay and the attendance bonus gives us Jen's total earnings for April:
\[ \$270 + \$40 = \$310 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to sum up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice this number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times this number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all these numbers to get the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with 6 colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors. Therefore, the number of colors left after the theft is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[\boxed{19}\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the first floor, which is 180 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]
   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

\[ 66 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 66 \]"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Shelley has in terms of Samantha's paintings:
\[ 27 = (K + 8) - 12 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 27 = K + 8 - 12 \]
\[ 27 = K - 4 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 27 + 4 = K \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we need to follow the sequence of price changes step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

2. **Price Increase in December:**
   In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January:**
   In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Thus, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both his standard lessons and his discounted lessons for veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total earnings from these lessons are:
  \[
  4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80/\text{lesson} = \$320
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the discounted lessons for veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 25% off his standard rate.
- The reduced rate is:
  \[
  \$80 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$80 \times 0.75 = \$60/\text{lesson}
  \]
- The total earnings from these lessons are:
  \[
  2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60/\text{lesson} = \$120
  \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[
\$320 + \$120 = \$440
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[
\boxed{440}
\]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the total sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sum all the scores**:
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

   So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

2. **Count the number of scores**: There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{630}{9} = 70
   \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many pomelos Eve gave away, we start by noting that Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount. 

First, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos after giving some away. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]
Thus, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

After eating 24 apples, the number of apples remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples remaining is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). According to the problem, 3 quarters of \( x \) is equal to 9 novels. This can be written as:

\[ \frac{3}{4} x = 9 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know the total number of hours he travels. Assuming he travels every day without stopping, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of hours he travels each day, we assume he travels for 24 hours each day (a full day). Therefore, in 3 days, he travels:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that 3600 km represents:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline.
2. Calculate the number of grapes used by her brother.
3. Calculate the number of grapes used to make the pies.
4. Sum up all the grapes used and the grapes remaining to find the initial number of grapes.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, and their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Let's denote the total number of grapes at the beginning as \( G \). The number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \]
So, the number of grapes remaining for the pies is:
\[ G - 36 \]
Since the pies used up the remaining grapes, we have:
\[ G - 36 = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]
Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate it:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ \boxed{520.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, which is within the given timeframe.

Now, to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning per day and then find the percentage of that time relative to the 8-hour workday.

Since the total time required is 20 hours and they have 5 days to complete it, the average time spent cleaning per day is:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ 50\% \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf.

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we sum the capacities of all the shelves:
\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey gets 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

Next, we need to find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement for the total number of questions. The second test has 40 questions, so she needs to answer 70% of 40 questions correctly:
\[ 40 \times 0.70 = 28 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach a total of 28 correct answers. She has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, but since we are only concerned with the second test, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach 28 correct answers. Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly, she has already exceeded the requirement for the second test. However, the problem is asking for the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test to meet the 70% requirement for the total number of questions, which is 28.

Thus, the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that one. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to ensure he meets or exceeds the 15 car sales goal).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

1. **Number of Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the house (Brianna and her 3 family members).
   - There are 2 flashlights for each room.
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is calculated as:
     \[
     4 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ flashlights/person} = 8 \text{ flashlights}
     \]

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is calculated as:
     \[
     (4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room}) + (4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room}) = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
     \]

3. **Total Number of Candles and Flashlights:**
   - Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together:

   - Water per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water needed: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

Now, we sum up the total water needed for all the plants:
\[2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}\]

Therefore, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. The total distance is 200 yards, with half of the distance being on land and the other half in water. Therefore, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His hopping speed is 20 yards per minute. The time taken to hop 100 yards is:
\[
\text{Time to hop} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His swimming speed is 10 yards per minute. The time taken to swim 100 yards is:
\[
\text{Time to swim} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time for the entire journey is the sum of the time taken to hop and the time taken to swim:
\[
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. Identify the cost of the main phone. According to the problem, the main phone costs $20.
2. Determine the cost of each additional phone. The problem states that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. Calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are four additional phones, each costing $10. So, the total cost for the additional phones is $10 * 4 = $40.
4. Add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the phone plan. This is $20 + $40 = $60.

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"

Now, we add these amounts to find the total weekly cost:
\[
\$25.00 + \$6.00 + \$16.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\boxed{235}\) dollars on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. Therefore, his new speaking speed is:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so for 10 pages, the total number of words is:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then find the total for the week.

First, let's find the number of people at the beach each day:
- On the first day, there were 50 people.
- On the second day, there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
- On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Let's denote the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days) is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over these three days is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]
This means:
\[ x + x + x = 180 \]
\[ 3x = 180 \]
\[ x = 60 \]
So, the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days is 60 each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people seen over the entire week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 400 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we need to break down the problem into the different time intervals and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that pop: 20

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that pop: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that pop: \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - Number of kernels that pop: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\)

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop due to residual heat. Therefore, the number of additional kernels that pop due to residual heat is:
   - Additional kernels that pop: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

Now, we sum up the total number of kernels that popped:
   - Total kernels that popped: \(20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 190\)

The final numerical answer is:
190"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

Next, determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart:
\[ 1 \text{ cup} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon to the lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed to get 6 cups of juice is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we need to calculate the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs, and then extend that to a weekly total.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

Next, let's calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Total weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day \(\times\) 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Thus, the Kennel house will need \(\boxed{147}\) kilograms of dog food in a week."

   \]

3. **Total Number of Blue and Yellow Blocks:**
   Adding the number of blue and yellow blocks together:
   \[
   4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} = 12 \text{ blocks}
   \]

4. **Total Number of Blocks:**
   The problem states there are 32 blocks in total.

5. **Number of Red Blocks:**

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To determine the number of pink candies, we first need to calculate the number of orange and yellow candies based on the given information.

1. **Red Candies:**
   - Given: 54 red candies.

2. **Orange Candies:**
   - Given: Twice the amount of red candies.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) orange candies.

3. **Yellow Candies:**
   - Given: Half the amount of red candies.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) yellow candies.

Next, we sum the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[ 54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189 \text{ candies} \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the sum of the red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

Thus, the number of pink candies is:

"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost for one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the bus travels. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs for the hotel and the bus travels:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, he originally had:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

Mazie initially had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla combined is:

\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \text{ marbles} \]

Let \( D \) be the number of marbles Dallas received and \( D_L \) be the number of marbles Darla received. We know that:

\[ D + D_L = 27 \]

We also know that Dallas received \( D \) marbles and ended up with 25 marbles after dropping 4. So, the number of marbles Dallas received initially (before dropping 4) is:

\[ D = 25 + 4 = 29 \]

Now, substituting \( D = 29 \) into the equation \( D + D_L = 27 \):

\[ 29 + D_L = 27 \]

Solving for \( D_L \):

\[ D_L = 27 - 29 = -2 \]

Since the number of marbles cannot be negative, it indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the problem constraints and calculations. The correct interpretation should be:

\[ D = 25 \text{ (after dropping 4)} \]
\[ D_L = 27 - 25 = 2 \]

So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of adult tickets: $24
- Cost of child ticket: $8
- Cost of popcorns: $6

Total cost = \(24 + 8 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Given that Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

\[ \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56 \]

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can calculate the average of their ages. The average of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

So, the average of their ages is 48.

"To determine how much Avery will spend on the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of one complete place setting and then multiply by the number of people.

A place setting consists of:
- 1 dinner plate
- 1 salad plate
- 1 bowl

The costs are:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

First, we calculate the cost of one place setting:
\[ \text{Cost of one place setting} = \text{Cost of dinner plate} + \text{Cost of salad plate} + \text{Cost of bowl} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one place setting} = 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

Avery is having 12 people over, so she needs 12 place settings. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of one place setting} \times \text{Number of place settings} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00 \]

Thus, Avery will spend \(\boxed{180.00}\) on place settings."

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Since there are five pigs, the total feed consumption per day is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption in a week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
- The amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.
2. Determine the number of packs of hot dogs required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.**

John invited 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Additionally, he has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.

Total hot dogs needed = (Number of guests) × (Hot dogs per guest) + (Hot dogs left over)
Total hot dogs needed = 20 × 2 + 4
Total hot dogs needed = 40 + 4
Total hot dogs needed = 44

**Step 2: Determine the number of packs of hot dogs required.**

Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't buy a fraction of a pack).

Number of packs needed = Ceiling(44 ÷ 6)
Number of packs needed = Ceiling(7.3333)
Number of packs needed = 8

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.**

Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = Number of packs needed × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × 2
Total cost = 16

So, John needs to spend $16 on hot dogs.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

For the cupcakes:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
- Total revenue from cupcakes = 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40.

For the cookies:
- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
- Total revenue from cookies = 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both cupcakes and cookies:
- Total revenue = $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the trays of cupcakes:
- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
- Total cost for trays = 5 trays * $4/tray = $20.

Now, let's calculate the net amount of money Frances has left after accounting for the cost of the trays:
- Net amount = Total revenue - Total cost = $80 - $20 = $60.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

At this point, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract the 5 original children from the 30 children that are following the truck on the third street.

Thus, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[25\]"

\[ 94 + 48 = 142 \]

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the number of meals given out from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute:
\[ 1360 - 142 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 1360 - 142 = 1218 \]

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is:
\[ \boxed{1218} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin into cents and then sum them up.

1. A quarter is worth 25 cents.
2. A nickel is worth 5 cents. Since James has two nickels, the total value of the nickels is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.
3. A dime is worth 10 cents. Since James has seven dimes, the total value of the dimes is \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, we add the values of the quarters, nickels, and dimes together:
\[25 + 10 + 70 = 105\]

So, the total amount of money James has is 105 cents. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{105}

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the activities and their durations.

1. **Meditation:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
   - Total meditation time per day = 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
   - Since she meditates 5 days a week, the weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

2. **Yoga:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) every day.
   - Since she practices yoga 5 days a week, the weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
   - Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks = Total meditation time + Total yoga time = 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum these values.

For the small t-shirts:
\[ 11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet} \]

For the medium t-shirts:
\[ 8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]

For the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we sum the square footage from all the t-shirts:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is:
\[ 101 \text{ square feet} \]

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower:

\[ 36 \text{ (small sunflower seeds)} + 54 \text{ (large sunflower seeds)} = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"To determine how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pens Timothy has.
2. Use the number of pens Timothy has to find out how many pens Sarah has.

First, we know that George has 18 pens. According to the problem, Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Therefore, we calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pens George has} = 3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Next, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27

"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in one week.
3. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

**Step 1: Number of bars produced in one day**
The company produces 5000 bars per day.

**Step 2: Number of bars produced in one week**
There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the number of bars produced in one week is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total original price for 2 T-shirts is \(2 \times 8 = $16\).
- The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, so for every T-shirt Jake buys, he gets another one at 50% off. This means he pays full price for one T-shirt and half price for the other.
- Therefore, the cost for the first T-shirt is $8 and the cost for the second T-shirt is \(8 \times 0.5 = $4\).
- The total cost for the 2 T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = $12\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount amount is \(40 \times 0.40 = $16\).
- The final price of the shoes after the discount is \(40 - 16 = $24\).

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
- Total cost for T-shirts: $12
- Total cost for shoes: $24
- Total amount spent: \(12 + 24 = $36\)

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each. The total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \text{ cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left for the movie tickets:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide $13 by $6.50:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole movie tickets, the number of movie tickets he can buy is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in total, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases separately and then add them together.

- Photo frame: $5
- Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Next, let's calculate Lani's total spending:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so $100 * 2 = $200
- Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's totals together:
- Total spent by Ellen: $105
- Total spent by Lani: $230
- Combined total: $105 + $230 = $335

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is $335."
"To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

Now, let's find the total cost for one jar:
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$44/\text{jar} = \$440
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500
\]

Finally, we determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$500 - \$440 = \$60
\]

Thus, Tim's profit from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:

\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount her parents gave her:

\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days Josh works in a week.
2. Calculate the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Calculate his earnings for 2 weeks.

First, let's find out how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works on 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in a week he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, we calculate his earnings for 2 weeks:

- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.

Total holes dug by the dog:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over time when Nate returns:
- Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day.
- The dog digs 6 holes per night.

Net holes filled per day:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( 2V \), we can express the distance he ran as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = 2V \times 16 = 32V \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \) and the distance Vanessa ran as \( D_V \). We know that \( D_V = 4 \) miles. The distance Aaron ran is \( D_A = 32V \). Since the total distance of the race is the sum of the distances run by Aaron and Vanessa, we have:

\[ D_A + D_V = \text{Total distance} \]
\[ 32V + 4 = \text{Total distance} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( 2V \), the time \( t_A \) it took Aaron to run his distance is given by:

\[ t_A = \frac{D_A}{A} = \frac{32V}{2V} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

This confirms that Aaron's time is indeed 16 minutes. Now, we need to find the time \( t_V \) it took Vanessa to run her distance. Since Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute and she ran 4 miles, we have:

\[ t_V = \frac{D_V}{V} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We know that \( D_A = 32V \) and \( D_V = 4 \), so:

\[ 32V = 2V \times t_V \]
\[ 32V = 2V \times t_V \]
\[ t_V = \frac{32V}{2V} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

However, we need to find the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles. Since \( D_V = 4 \) miles and \( V \) is the speed in miles per minute, the time \( t_V \) is:

\[ t_V = \frac{4}{V} \]

Since \( V = \frac{A}{2} \) and \( A = 2V \), we can substitute \( V = \frac{A}{2} \) into the equation:

\[ t_V = \frac{4}{\frac{A}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{A} = \frac{8}{A} \]

Since \( A = 2V \) and \( V = \frac{A}{2} \), we can use the fact that \( A = 2V \) and \( V = \frac{A}{2} \):

\[ t_V = \frac{4}{V} = \frac{4}{\frac{A}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{A} = \frac{8}{A} = \frac{8}{2V} = \frac{4}{V} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 8 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line he already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of reservations per night:**
   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.

2. **Determine the number of reservations per day:**
   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   Multiply the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[ \text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

Adding this profit to the original cost price gives us the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the current age of James. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, Dora's current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]
Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine how old John is currently. We know that John had a son James when he was 19, and James is currently 18. Therefore, John is currently:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]
In 3 years, the youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
