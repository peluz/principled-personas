"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and then multiply that by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has each day:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs to make muffins.

The total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for muffins)} = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

The number of eggs she sells is:
\[ 16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (used eggs)} = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it takes 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after Josh's repairs. The original value of the house is $80,000. The repairs added $50,000 to the house, so the total value of the house after repairs is:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the increase in value due to the 150% increase. A 150% increase means the value of the house is increased by 150% of its original value after repairs. To find 150% of $130,000, we calculate:

\[ 150\% \times 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the value after repairs gives us the final value of the house:

\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on repairs, so the total cost for Josh was:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the final value of the house:

\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters he runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters he runs in one week for all sprints:**
   James runs 180 meters in one week for one sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \]
In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 16 glasses, we can divide them into 8 pairs of glasses. Each pair costs $8.

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by determining the number of sheep in each city based on the given information.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update installation: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart and download of the remaining 60%: 60 minutes

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
- First segment: 180 miles
- Second segment: 0 miles
- Third segment: 15 miles
- Fourth segment: 120 miles

Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 315 miles."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, let's calculate the number of downloads for each month:

1. **First Month:** The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month:** The number of downloads was three times as many as the first month. Therefore, the downloads in the second month were:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
3. **Third Month:** The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month. To find the reduced number of downloads, we calculate 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]

Now, we sum the number of downloads over the three months:
\[
60 \text{ (first month)} + 180 \text{ (second month)} + 126 \text{ (third month)} = 366
\]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

Annual revenue from lemons:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit/year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year} \]

Carlos initially invests $90 to plant the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial investment.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial investment. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Total net profit} = n \times \$7.5 \]

We set this equal to the initial investment to find \( n \):
\[ n \times \$7.5 = \$90 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. 

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

\[ 2x = 36 \]

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

The calculations confirm that Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

18"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that this represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of hip-hop dance students} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the profit the merchant would make by choosing between the two purchase plans, we need to calculate the value of each item after the market increase and then find the difference between the two values.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[
\text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[
\text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we find the difference in value between the two options to determine the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Value of electronic gadgets} - \text{Value of jewelry} = 8096 - 5125 = 2971
\]

Therefore, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets over the jewelry is:
\[
\boxed{2971}
\]"

Then, they travel northwards for 150 miles.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of these two distances:
\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual teaching earnings are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$20/\text{hour} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual coaching earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's do the calculations:

For teaching:
\[ 35 \times 50 \times 20 = 3500 \times 20 = 70000 \]

For coaching:
\[ 15 \times 50 \times 30 = 750 \times 30 = 22500 \]

Finally, we add her annual teaching and coaching earnings to get her total annual salary:
\[ 70000 + 22500 = 92500 \]

So, Jill's annual salary is $92,500."

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**
   - Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time Marissa has:**

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters of liquid. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we are left with \( 25 - 1 = 24 \) liters of liquid.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of liquid:
- The amount of water from the orange drink is \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- The amount of water from the pineapple drink is 9 liters.

Adding these together, the total amount of water is:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is \( \frac{47}{3} \) liters. Let's express this as a decimal for clarity:
\[ \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \]

However, the question asks for the final numerical answer in a separate line:
\[ \frac{47}{3} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). Then, we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount paid:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:

- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = 3 * $16.50 = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = 3 * $42 = $126.

Finally, let's sum up the total cost for all the clothing items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $253.

Therefore, Mishka spent $253 on all the clothing items."

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

First, we know the total distance of Henry's bike trip is 60 miles. He first stopped after traveling 20 miles. This means the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

Next, his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ 25 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, the total time spent on one dog per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( G = S + 30 \) (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)
2. \( G + S = 110 \) (since the total number of coins is 110)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the first equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many jewels Aaron has:**
   - We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. **Determine how many jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 23."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate how many sets of 4 yogurts he needs to buy to meet his consumption.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set.

First, let's calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195
\]

Next, let's determine the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160
\]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. To find out how much money he spent on the video games, we subtract the amount he has left from the total amount he made from selling the lego sets.

\[
\$195 - \$5 = \$190
\]

This $190 is the amount he spent on the video games. We can verify this by checking if it matches the cost of the 8 video games:

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160
\]

Since the calculation is consistent, we can conclude that John spent $160 on the video games, leaving him with $5.

Finally, since John started with 13 lego sets and he has not sold or bought any lego sets, he still has all 13 lego sets.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets John still has} = 13
\]

\[
\boxed{13}

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide that by the total time he spends running.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day.

The total time spent running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone age**: We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   \[
   \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 1 \text{ year}
   \]

2. **Ben's iPhone age**: Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. This means Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone age**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. This means Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies into 8 pieces each, so the total number of pieces was:

The final numerical answer is 26."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can confirm that the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings as follows:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g, the amount of chips that can be eaten is:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday:** She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. She ended up with 23 post-it notes remaining after placing one on each of 220 cups of coffee and giving the rest to her friends.
3. Therefore, the total number of post-it notes she used and gave away is 80 - 23 = 57.
4. Since she used one post-it note for each of the 220 cups of coffee, she gave away 220 post-it notes.
5. The remaining 57 post-it notes were the ones she purchased in the store.
6. Thus, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is 57.

The final numerical answer is 57."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of a red tie} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"

"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly revenue from selling the eggs.

First, let's find out how many dozens of eggs are produced per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate the daily revenue. Since Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily revenue} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the weekly revenue, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \text{Weekly revenue} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this, we need to know the distance Tom traveled to get from 1 to 4 PM. Since the speed is given as 10 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM), we can calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 mph. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles at this speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. 

The final numerical answer is 5."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the days, I will first calculate the total revenue for Thursday and then for Friday, and finally find the difference.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each costing $60, so the revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160.
- The total revenue for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is $480.

Now, to find the difference in revenue between Friday and Thursday:
- The difference is $480 - $520 = -$40.

The mechanic earned $40 less on Friday compared to Thursday. Therefore, the day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is $40.

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

The original bill was $40.00. The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the total, and then charged an additional $3.00 in delivery fees. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.

First, let's calculate the 25% delivery fee on the original bill:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times \$40.00 = \$10.00 \]

Next, we add the delivery fee to the original bill:
\[ \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, we add the delivery fee to the total:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of $1300
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two different rates of pension payment: the initial rate and the increased rate after 20 years.

1. **Initial Pension Rate (Years 0-20):**
   - Marcy gets $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
   - After 20 years, her pension increases to 5% of the value of the pension.

2. **Pension Value After 20 Years:**
   - After 20 years, her pension is worth $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.

3. **Increased Pension Rate (Years 20-30):**
   - Starting from year 21, her pension increases to 5% of the value of the pension.
   - The value of her pension at year 21 is $1,000,000.
   - Her new pension rate is 5% of $1,000,000 = $50,000.

Therefore, after 30 years, Marcy's annual pension will be $50,000."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - The initial amount is $140.
   - The reduced amount is:
     \[
     140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756
     \]

3. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Adding the costs from both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{1596}

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip.

She started with 12 gallons and used 4 gallons to travel 100 miles. So, the amount of gas left in her tank is:
12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 8 gallons of gas. We know that 4 gallons of gas allows her to drive 100 miles. Therefore, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:
100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

With 8 gallons of gas, the distance she can drive is:
8 gallons * 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles

So, the final numerical answer is 200 miles."
"First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jim does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
- Level 3: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- Level 1: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet.
- Level 2: 4 square feet.
- Level 3: 8 square feet.
- Level 4: 16 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how much dog food the puppy will need for the rest of its life within the first year. Since the problem does not specify the puppy's lifespan, we assume the first year is the entire period we are considering.

For the rest of the first year, the puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day. There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days left in the first year is:
\[
365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days}
\]

Now, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
- The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
  \[
  2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Adding the dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days gives us the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
\[
180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}
\]

Finally, we determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags}
\]

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David does:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, Raymond does:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so the total cost is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so the total cost is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The savings by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves 6 dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To calculate the cost after the discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. The original cost is $100, and the discount is 30%.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**: 
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: A = J + 5
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: A = C - 2
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: 10 = C - 1

From the third piece of information, we can solve for Corey's age:
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now, using the second piece of information, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

And using the first piece of information, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles and then calculate his new time after a 10% improvement due to his diet.

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Determine the original time difference:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. Therefore, Gerald's original time is:
   \[
   38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement:**
   Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of his original time. We calculate this as follows:

2. **Number of Cats**: Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. **Number of Rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we calculate:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- 5 cars exited the motorway before the traffic jam started, so there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars left.
- In the first 15 minutes, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam.
- After the first 15 minutes, 5 cars exited the motorway, so 25 - 5 = 20 cars remained in the motorway.

Now, we know that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which means she has a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will remain with is \(80 - 40 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can calculate the total number of doorbell rings by adding the number of rings from each friend:

Total doorbell rings = First friend's rings + Second friend's rings + Third friend's rings + Fourth friend's rings
Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60

Let's calculate the sum:

Total doorbell rings = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

So, the final numerical answer is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first add up all the pages from his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading after reading 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the number of pages he needs to read in the remaining 4 days is:

39 pages (total) - 15 pages (read on Monday) = 24 pages

To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day over the next 4 days, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages/day

So, the final numerical answer is 6 pages per day."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks one glass of water with each meal:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner

He has three meals a day, so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day during weekdays.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of glasses of water he drinks during weekdays is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks one glass of water with dinner, but instead of soda, he relaxes and drinks a soda. So, he drinks 1 glass of water on each of the 2 weekend days.

The total number of glasses of water he drinks during weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks during weekdays and weekends, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 17 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 17 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Given that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate the total time required by dividing the total distance by the distance covered in 10 minutes and then multiplying by 10 minutes.

Here's the calculation:

1. Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
   \]

2. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time required to cover the entire city is:
   \[
   14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   So, 750 pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   So, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final numerical answer is 500."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is then:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 108 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (0.5 hours) = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours:
1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours we've calculated is the additional hours he watched on Wednesday:
7 - 6 = 1 hour

Since the additional hour is 1 hour, and we know that 1 hour is equivalent to 2 30-minute episodes, Frankie watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked \( x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, and he now has 110 cookies left. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, he baked \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) cookies. However, the question asks for the number of cookies he baked last year, which is the number he meant to bake, which is 100.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the final cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to determine the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback. The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the cost would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback reward. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the cashback would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

To find the final cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards is:

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-ups is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-ups is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-ups is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-ups is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both have together:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

Since they both ate their entire amount, the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 90. To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's determine how many seconds it took Julia to row 10 feet. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, it would take her 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Next, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in the 64-second rowing time. We do this by dividing 64 seconds by 8 seconds per 10 feet:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{8 \text{ seconds/10 feet}} = 8 \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the number of 10-foot segments by the amount of water taken on per segment:

\[ 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Let's denote the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1800 = 6B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. The problem also states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Thus, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \( D = 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons and cups of water combined.

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the sum of these quantities is 120:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, which is \(7x\):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of vehicles initially at the port.
2. Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Determine the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.40 = 56000

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

- Cost of 4 watermelons:
\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \]
- Cost of 20 peppers:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]
- Cost of 10 oranges:
\[ 10 \times 40 = 400 \]

Finally, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients seen in a day.

First, let's calculate the revenue the hospital receives from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- Therefore, the revenue from each patient is $200 * 0.4 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost the hospital incurs for each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour.
- Therefore, the cost for each patient is $150 * 0.4 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the profit for each patient:
- Profit per patient = Revenue per patient - Cost per patient = $80 - $60 = $20.

Finally, we calculate the total profit for the hospital from 500 patients:
- Total profit = Profit per patient * Number of patients = $20 * 500 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"To find out how many elves are left, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **Initial number of elves**: 60
2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) elves quit.
3. **Remaining elves after some quit**: \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) elves.
4. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 of the remaining elves quit, so \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) elves are left.

Therefore, the final number of elves left is 30."

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times, so she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, Pam used a total of \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used:

- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, Fred used a total of \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, let's add the tickets used by Pam and Fred:

- Pam used 24 tickets.
- Fred used 36 tickets.
- Together, they used \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

The final numerical answer is 60."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Miles on Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can use this information to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. Let's denote the miles he walked on Wednesday as \( W \). The total mileage can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4 + 24 + W = 41 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ 28 + W = 41 \]
\[ W = 41 - 28 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we first need to find out how many car washes he gets in a year and then multiply that by the cost of each car wash.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of car washes in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Each car wash costs $15, so the total cost for the year is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$720/\text{year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the items before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the items:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, adding the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, Rory's total delivery order cost is $29.00."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete on the first test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete on the second test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Finally, we add the incomplete questions from both tests to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"

\[ B = 12 \]

The problem also states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400."

"To calculate the profit, we first need to determine the total expenses and then subtract them from the total income.

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of 8 clients.

Each client requires:
- 2 bottles of bleach
- 1 pack of cloths

The cost for each bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost for each pack of cloths is $5.

Therefore, the total cost for bleach for 8 clients is:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = \$32 \]

And the total cost for cloths for 8 clients is:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} \times \$5/\text{pack} = 8 \times 1 \times 5 = \$40 \]

So, the total expenses for 8 clients are:
\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125. 

The final numerical answer is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** 
   - Initial population: 0 (assuming no bees initially)
   - After 30 bees leave: 0
   - After 15 bees return: 15
   - After 60 bees leave: 15 - 60 = -45 (This means there are no bees left, as the number of bees that left exceeds the number that returned).

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:** Since there are no bees left, and all bees that left in the last 6 hours (60 bees) have left, no bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 0."

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home.

The difference in their waiting time at home is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race."
"To calculate the total amount Shawnda made, we need to consider the cost of inflating the tires for each type of vehicle and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so there are 5 * 2 = 10 tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating the tires for the bicycles is 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating the tires for the tricycles is 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, so there is 1 * 1 = 1 tire to inflate.
- The cost for inflating the tire for the unicycle is 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, we sum the costs for all the vehicles:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
- Total cost in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is 5 dollars."

"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon stole the fries, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate the fries, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull stole the fries, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries that Dave bought originally had 45 fries.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours he spends each day and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours he spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.
- There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
- So, in one week, he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours on these days.

Next, let's calculate the hours he spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.
- There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday).
- So, in one week, he spends \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours on these days.

Now, let's add the hours spent on all days in one week:
- Total hours in one week = hours on Monday, Wednesday, Friday + hours on Tuesday, Thursday
- Total hours in one week = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours spent in one semester (16 weeks):
- Total hours in one semester = hours in one week \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total hours in one semester = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours."
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls. So, the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants. So, the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \text{ feet/baguette} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches/baguette}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly consumption of bananas by each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

First, let's calculate the monthly consumption:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we sum the monthly consumption:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper needs to order enough bananas to last for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, Blake's total distance is \(15 \times 200 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, Kelly's total distance is \(34 \times 80 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distances they run is:

"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the water depth on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the water depth on Wednesday based on the depth on Tuesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by each person and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we add up all the fish:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after each two-month period, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine the original price of the bag of marbles:
\[ \text{Original Price} = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the price increase every two months. The price increase is 20% of the original price:
\[ \text{Price Increase} = 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \]

So, the price after each two-month period is:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Price Increase} = 20 + 4 = \$24 \]

Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \text{Number of Two-Month Periods} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Now, we calculate the price after 18 two-month periods. Each two-month period, the price increases by 20% of the current price. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Price after } n \text{ periods} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^n \]

Substituting \( n = 18 \):
\[ \text{Price after 18 periods} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

We need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

Now, multiply this by the original price:
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{209.76} \]"
"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars**: There are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total value of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20
   \]

2. **Action Figures**: There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total value of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Doll**: The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
   \[
   \text{Cost of doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up the values of all the toys:
\[
\text{Total value of all toys} = \text{Total value of red cars} + \text{Total value of action figures} + \text{Cost of doll}
\]
\[
\text{Total value of all toys} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50
\]

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour in missed income for freelance work if she does her taxes herself. If she hires an accountant, she will not lose any income from freelance work.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income she would have lost if she did her taxes herself:

Missed income if she does her taxes herself = $35/hour
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Difference = Missed income - Cost of hiring the accountant
Difference = $35/hour - $90

Since the missed income is per hour and the cost of hiring the accountant is a flat fee, we need to consider the time it would take to do her taxes herself. However, the question does not specify the time it would take for her to do her taxes herself, so we assume the cost of $90 is the total missed income over the time she would have spent doing her taxes herself.

Therefore, the amount of money Jackie will have more if she hires the accountant is:

$90 - $90 = $0

So, Jackie will have the same amount of money if she hires the accountant as she would if she did her taxes herself, considering the given information. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

0"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories = €157 + €74 + €102 + €102 = €435

Elvira's budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €435 = €1065

Therefore, the final numerical answer is €1065."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs \(15 \times 3 = 45\) eggs. Since she receives 9 eggs every time she babysits, she needs to babysit \(45 \div 9 = 5\) times.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is $8 * 2 = $16. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked from Monday to Friday and the miles walked on the weekend, we get:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

For the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, we add them all together:
640 legs (from spiders) + 540 legs (from insects) + 30 legs (from invertebrates) = 1210 legs

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

Total age = Age of Caboose + Age of Sally Two + Age of Granny Red + Age of Sally Four
Total age = 0 + 19 + 16 + 8
Total age = 43

The final numerical answer is 43."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds:
1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to do this for 60 potatoes:
- Time for one potato: 95 seconds
- Number of potatoes: 60

Multiply the time per potato by the number of potatoes:
95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
5700 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total revenue and then the total cost to find out how much they spent on lemons.

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can calculate the total revenue by adding the profit to the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \$25 \]

The total cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons and sugar per gallon} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( x \). Then the total revenue is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10x \]

The total cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5x \]

So, we have:
\[ 10x = 5x + 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 10x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ 5x = 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Charity Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we subtract 4 from the number of crabs Bo has:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we add 10 to the number of crabs Monic has:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:**
   We add the number of crabs each person has:
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the second piece of information:
\[
200 = 5w
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's calculate Jan's age two years ago:
- Jan's current age is 30, so two years ago she was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Next, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
- Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

According to the information given, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:
- Mark's age two years ago was 14 - 5 = 9 years.

Now, we need to find Mark's current age:
- Since Mark was 9 years old two years ago, his current age is 9 + 2 = 11 years.

Finally, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age is 11 + 2 = 13 years.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 13."
"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time taken by the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in the total times taken by the two teams:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
4. The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

Let's denote the number of rats as \( R \). Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 = 18R \).

The total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).

The total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, hamsters, and rabbits, which is 160. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 18R + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 18R + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:

\[ 18R = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[ R = 5 \]

So, there are 5 rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{5}{3} \]

However, since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, and the problem setup suggests a straightforward distribution, we can conclude that the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{5}{3} = 1 \text{ rat per cage with a remainder of 2 rats} \]

"To calculate the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to consider the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

First, let's calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest for one month} = 100 \times \frac{2}{100} = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the total interest for 3 months would be:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the initial debt to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months."
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

Therefore, the total cost for the trader is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells all the bags at a rate of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
Each friend's share = Total cost / 3 = $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each of them paid $34."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect in 3 hours, given that he collects 2 peaches per minute.

First, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3 hours, there are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for all the ducks combined.

Given that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Insects per day for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects are needed per day for the entire flock of ten ducks, we multiply the amount needed per day for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Insects per day for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in trees each year.
2. Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the net increase.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

Step 1: Net increase in trees each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees would be:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die after 10 years, so:
0.30 * 130 = 39 trees die.

Step 4: Number of trees left after 10 years
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years:
130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."
"To solve this, let's break down the events step by step:

1. **Friday morning**: Sue's front yard has 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. **Saturday morning**: The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is 6 flamingos. So, they take back 6 flamingos and paint them white. This leaves 12 pink flamingos on the yard. The 6 white flamingos are then put back out.
3. **Sunday morning**: Another 18 pink flamingos are added to the yard. Now, the total number of flamingos on the yard is 12 (remaining pink) + 6 (white) + 18 (new pink) = 36 flamingos.

Now, we need to find out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.

- Pink flamingos: 12 (remaining) + 18 (new) = 30
- White flamingos: 6

The difference is 30 - 6 = 24.

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. 

The final numerical answer is 24."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she prepared:

\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds."
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, let's break down the problem month by month.

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month**: She collected three times the number she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the second month, she has:
   \[
   80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Third month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the third month, she has:
   \[
   120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:
\[
\boxed{320}

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total earnings from both publishers.

First, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A each week, his earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B each week, his earnings from Publisher B are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find Mark's total earnings for the week, we add his earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets and then multiply that by the number of liters each pail contains.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is:

\[ 5 \text{ pails} + 6 \text{ pails} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total number of liters of water he gets every day is:

\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the raise in his salary.

First, let's calculate the raise in his salary. John's current weekly salary is $2000. The raise is 5% of this amount.

\[ \text{Raise} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new weekly salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John makes in a year from his new weekly salary. There are 52 weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Total Yearly Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

Additionally, John received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

\[ \text{Total Yearly Earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year from Josie's farm.

Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and she has 10 acres.

So, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes.

Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

So, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Total slices of cheese = slices for sandwiches + slices for omelets + slices for macaroni and cheese
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 27 slices.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Therefore, the total sum of the six test scores needed is:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. We subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score needed on the sixth test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Thus, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in four weeks = 4 weeks * 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in three weeks = 3 weeks * 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride.

Let's calculate these:

For the first four weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

For the next three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods to get the total:
\[ 500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, let's find the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2600 \text{ grams} \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total after three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that on Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates:
- The cost of one plate is $6000.
- Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
- Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
- Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since there are twenty dozen cups, we have:
- Twenty dozen cups means \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is $34800.
- Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Let's calculate the cost of one cup:
\[
\frac{34800}{240} = 145
\]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. To find out how much more money she needs to earn, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
- The total cost is $70, and she already has $10, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

Now, we need to determine how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per mowing:
- $60 / $4 = 15.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Total eggs collected:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as that's the distance he walks around.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance and speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day. Since the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, and there were 100 customers on the first day, the number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the first two days. This is the sum of the customers on the first and second days, which is 100 + 150 = 250.
3. Given that the total number of customers over the three days is 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers over the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days. This is 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

Given \( B = 4S \) and \( B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \):
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify:
4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the setup again. The correct interpretation should be:
\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work, I'll first determine the total cost of her purchase and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is:
$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, I'll divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[
\text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \implies \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Now, determine their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

To find the average age of the three in three years, sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}

"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To calculate the total cost of their rentals, we need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours each person rents the equipment for and then add the two amounts together.

For Carlos:
- Hourly rate: $30
- Hours rented: 3
- Total cost for Carlos = $30 * 3 = $90

For Benji:
- Hourly rate: $18
- Hours rented: 5
- Total cost for Benji = $18 * 5 = $90

Now, we add the total costs for Carlos and Benji:
- Total cost = $90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card after the changes in James's collection.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, he has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

The total number of cards after these changes is:
30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 32 (water) = 82 cards

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100.

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{82} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this value.
```python
# Calculation

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces together.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark then pays $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000

"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats in a week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), he eats:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, she eats:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. 

First, Ram buys 25 pens. Since he can make one new pen from five empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens he initially bought. 

After using these 25 pens to make 5 new pens, he now has 5 new pens plus the 20 empty pens he has left from the original 25 pens (since 25 - 5 = 20). 

Now, he can use these 20 empty pens to make 20 / 5 = 4 more new pens. 

After using these 20 pens to make 4 more new pens, he now has 4 new pens plus the 16 empty pens he has left from the previous 20 pens (since 20 - 4 = 16). 

Now, he can use these 16 empty pens to make 16 / 5 = 3 more new pens, with 1 pen left over (since 16 / 5 = 3 with a remainder of 1).

After using these 16 pens to make 3 more new pens, he now has 3 new pens plus the 15 empty pens he has left from the previous 16 pens (since 16 - 3 = 13, and then 13 - 1 = 12, and then 12 - 1 = 11, and so on, until 15 -

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine the ages of each girl individually.

Given:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.

First, let's calculate Joan's age:
\[
\text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, let's calculate Mary's age:
\[
\text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
\text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
\]

Adding these together:
\[
23 + 25 = 48
\]
\[
48 + 20 = 68
\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of students**: 1000

2. **Students exiting through exit A**: 30% of 1000
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students left through exit A.

3. **Remaining students after exit A**: 
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

4. **Students exiting through exit B**: 3/5 of the remaining students
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students left through exit B.

5. **Remaining students after exit B**: 
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

6. **Students exiting through exit C**: The rest of the students
   \[
   280

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. Therefore, Robert has:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We already know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. Therefore, the difference is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has two books and reads them, so she reads 2 books. Additionally, Dolly reads Pandora's book, which is 1 book. Therefore, Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has one book and reads it, so she reads 1 book. Additionally, Pandora reads Dolly's books, which are 2 books. Therefore, Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people.
2. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.
3. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long.
4. Therefore, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week.
5. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all 3 people is 3 * 10 = 30 pages a week.
6. Mike responds in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week.
7. In total, Mike sends 30 pages to others and 30 pages back, which is 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.
8. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so to write 60 pages, he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.
9. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 360 minutes is equal to 360 / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 6 hours."
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his total plan.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason has used:
- Jason has a plan of 1000 minutes per month.
- He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he makes 30 * 15 = 450 minutes of calls to his boss.
- Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

So, the total minutes used is:
450 (to his boss) + 300 (extra) = 750 minutes.

Now, subtract the total minutes used from his plan:
1000 (total plan) - 750 (total used) = 250 minutes.

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means that Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

So, the number of fries that Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on her makeup over the course of the movie.

She requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. So, the makeup artist spends:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours spent on makeup is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \times \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$27,000 \]"
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses:

- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split the total cost evenly among her three parents. Therefore, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

So, each person paid $32.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply that by the cost per pound.

First, let's find the total weight of the onions:
- The chef bought 4 bags of onions.
- Each bag weighs 50 pounds.

Total weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Total weight = 4 * 50 = 200 pounds

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost of 1 pound of onions is $1.50.

Total cost = Total weight * Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 * 1.50 = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300.

"To solve this, let's first determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Sue's sister's total cookies:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Sue's total calories:
- \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Sue's sister's total calories:
- \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the total calories Sue's sister consumed from the total calories Sue consumed:

\(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls, which means 5 girls (20 - 15 = 5).
5. The second class has 12 girls, which means 8 girls (20 - 12 = 8).

Now, let's calculate the total number of boys and girls in the school:

- Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60.
- Therefore, there are 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the third class:

- The first class has 5 girls.
- The second class has 8 girls.
- So, the third class must have 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 girls.

Since each class has 20 students, and the third class has 17 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:

20 - 17 = 3 boys.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 3."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know from the problem that last night Rick killed ten wolves and fifteen cougars. So, the number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than the previous night. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( c \). Then the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).

According to the problem, the number of cougars killed today is three fewer than the number of cougars killed last night. Since last night Rick killed fifteen cougars, today he killed:
\[ c = 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is:
\[ 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals killed today:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

Finally, to find the total number of animals killed over the two days, we add the number of animals killed last night to the number of animals killed today:
\[ 25 \text{ animals} + 48 \text{ animals} = 73 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals killed by Rick is:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he now has is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 240 cows equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many cows each stall will have, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 12 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 12 \text{ cows/stall} = 96 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Brady has a total of **45.00 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"First, let's determine the total length of the redwood tree in 10-foot sections:

\[ \text{Total length of the redwood tree} = 200 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Length of each section} = 10 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before any damage:

\[ \text{Weight per section} = 400 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites, which ate 30% of the wood:

\[ \text{Percentage of wood eaten by termites} = 30\% = 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we calculate the remaining weight of the redwood tree:

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay, we need to consider both the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6.00 \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the information given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so if Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal has \( 52 - 8 = 44 \) apples.
2. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

Since Jamal has 44 apples, we can substitute \( J_a \) with 44:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, we know:
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

To find the total number of fruits, we add up all the fruits:
- Andrea's apples: 52
- Jamal's apples: 44
- Jamal's bananas: 48

Total number of fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 44 (Jamal's apples) + 48 (Jamal's bananas) = 144

So, the final numerical answer is 144."
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."
"Maddison originally has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, which totals to:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees:

\[ \text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference in number of trees} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to find the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Transfer fees**: 3% of $400,000
\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

2. **Brokerage fee**: 5% of $400,000
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

3. **Loan repayment**: $250,000

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds:
\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:** 40% longer than 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.4 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Time to cook the chicken:** 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The time to cook the chicken is \( 28 - 5 = 23 \) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** 
   - This is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = 20 minutes (to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (to cook) = 71 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 71 minutes."
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
Cost of newspaper ads = Number of newspaper ads × Cost per newspaper ad
Cost of newspaper ads = 50 × $5
Cost of newspaper ads = $250

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
Cost of television ads = Number of television ads × Cost per television ad
Cost of television ads = 15 × $75
Cost of television ads = $1125

Now, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1125
Total cost = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."

\[ 300 + 12 = 312 \]

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is:
\[ 762 \]"
"To find the total number of windows in both houses, I'll calculate the number of windows in one house and then multiply by two.

In one house:
- There are 3 bedrooms, each with 2 windows, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 windows from bedrooms.
- There are 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

So, in one house, there are 6 + 4 = 10 windows.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in both houses is 10 * 2 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Collar and rosette stitches} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. So, the stitches for the body and the sleeves together are:
\[ \text{Body and sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we can find the number of stitches for each sleeve by dividing the total stitches for the body and the sleeves by 2:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 765 stitches."

80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the costs together:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of these lines to memorize:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of these lines to memorize:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   Now, we sum the lines Sean has to memorize for the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene:

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first need to calculate the total time in minutes and then convert that to hours.

Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole. Therefore, for 30 small holes, the time taken is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole. Therefore, for 15 large holes, the time taken is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for both types of holes gives the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we can start by understanding the current sum of their ages, which is given as 20. 

In 10 years, each of their ages will increase by 10 years. Therefore, we can calculate the total increase in their combined ages by multiplying the number of years by 2 (since there are two individuals):

\[ 10 \text{ years} \times 2 = 20 \text{ years} \]

Now, we add this total increase to the current sum of their ages:

\[ 20 \text{ years (current sum)} + 20 \text{ years (increase)} = 40 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \text{Sam's current age} = 6 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots for all the cobras and mambas to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of the combined total spots:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we add up the totals for all three:

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to determine the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars, and then subtract that from the total number of stars on the flag.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars by 5 to find the number of rows:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so 80 flagstones will weigh:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

Next, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. The distance covered by both cars is 480 miles. We can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane as follows:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can start by determining the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 390 \]

- There are 8 packets.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \).

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The number of chocolate bars for the adults is 24.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left for the children is \( 40 - 24 = 16 \).

Finally, we need to share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 16 chocolate bars left.
- There are 8 children.
- Therefore, each child will get \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \) chocolate bars.

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, we subtract that from the total time:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to convert the working time into minutes because Susan earns money based on 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $75."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players get an extra point in the fourth round. According to the problem, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, we need to check each player:
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

Now, we add the extra points to each player's total:
- Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim's total remains \(18\) points.
- Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, we calculate the total points for all three players:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is the sum of their ages:
- Oldest son: 8 years
- Youngest son: 4 years

So, the total number of oranges washed is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons washed 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's determine the number of each exercise Darren does on the second day:
- On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups.
- On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, so he does \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups.
- On the first day, Darren does 50 squats.
- On the second day, he does 10 fewer squats than on the first day, so he does \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats.
- On the first day, Darren does 20 dumbbell presses.
- On the second day, he doubles the number of dumbbell presses, so he does \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each exercise he does in the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Finally, we add up all the exercises to get the total count:
\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Let's start with step 1:

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Next, step 2:

Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Then, step 3:

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total number of days the 42 kg will last:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, step 4:

To find out how many weeks 21 days is, we divide by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's determine the number of days Sam was open to sell bread. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he was open for 5 days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend).

Next, we add the crates sold on each of the days he was open:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum these amounts:
15 crates (Tuesday) + 12 crates (Wednesday) + 18 crates (Thursday) + 20 crates (weekend) = 65 crates

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
120 crates (target) - 65 crates (sold) = 55 crates

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Carmen wins the auction after her fourth bid. To find the total amount she spent, we sum up all her bids:

\[
200 + 300 + 350 + 400
\]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[
200 + 300 = 500
\]
\[
500 + 350 = 850
\]
\[
850 + 400 = 1250
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carmen spent on the antique desk is:

\[
\boxed{1250}

"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to consider the cost of miles driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles per week.
- He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver in a year:
- He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150 * 12 = $1,800.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $31,800."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

"To create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on the front and two pages on the back, totaling four pages per fold. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to determine how many folds are required. Since each fold doubles the number of pages, we can calculate the number of folds needed as follows:

- 1 fold: 4 pages
- 2 folds: 8 pages
- 3 folds: 16 pages
- 4 folds: 32 pages

Thus, we need 4 folds to create a 32-page tabloid. Each fold requires a new piece of paper. Therefore, we need 4 pieces of paper.

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To find out how much money Annika has left, we can follow these steps:

1. Annika started with $50.
2. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25.
3. After spending $25 on food and snacks, she has $50 - $25 = $25 left.
4. She then spent an additional $10 on rides.
5. After spending $10 on rides, she has $25 - $10 = $15 left.

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books: 250
- Unsold books: 50
- Books sold: 250 - 50 = 200
- Books sold in the current year: 45
- Books sold in the first year: 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65

Each book sells for $20.

To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:

\[ 65 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 1300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 1300 dollars."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage:
- Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

Weekly hours worked: \( 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \)

Weekly earnings from hourly wage: \( 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500 \)

Next, we add the weekly bonus:
- Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.

Total weekly earnings: \( \$500 + \$300 = \$800 \)

Now, we need to calculate his total earnings for the month of April. April has 30 days, and we assume it has 4 full weeks plus 2 extra days.

Number of full weeks in April: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \)

Total earnings for 4 full weeks: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \)

For the extra 2 days in April, we calculate the earnings for those days:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

Earnings for 2 extra days: \( 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$200 \)

Total earnings for the month of April: \( \$3200 + \$200 = \$3400 \)

Therefore, Watson made $3400 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To find out how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat.

John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. 

80% of 20 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 4."
"To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total loaves produced each day:** 60 loaves.

2. **Morning sales:** Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   \[
   \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves left after morning sales:** 
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and evening sales:** Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \text{Weight lost by Joey in one week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in one week), we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. 

The final numerical answer is:

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of 1 tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of 1 tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on 1 tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on 1 packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 3, which is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 5, which is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = number of extra arms + number of extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend is:
Total amount - Amount to save = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, to find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total costs from the amount he can spend:
Amount to spend on gifts = Amount he can spend - Total costs = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $2050."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we need to break down the daily consumption and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \times 7 = 91 \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age and then use that to find Trent's age.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.

So, Jane's age is:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

So, Trent's age is:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's first determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Also, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2, so we rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8. 

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his 20 marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by Solomon's father to the total number of marbles in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 156 \text{ kg} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 156 \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, 10 people left the party. If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is:

\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]

Since 10 people in total left the party, and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Therefore, the number of women who left is:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:

\[ 15 - 8 = 7 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Adding the 46 pencils that Meg has, we get the total number of pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, we need to consider that each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of the cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Therefore, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100% and then calculate the time required based on the given rate.

The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100%. Therefore, it needs to be charged by 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours:

\[ \text{Time required in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and receives an additional 10 from her mother, so she has a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. After giving 3 lollipops to Ella, she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left. 

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - Since the rewards used were $8, the coupon takes off $16 (twice the rewards).

4. **Calculate the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon:**
   - The original cost of the current shopping trip is $43.
   - Subtract the rewards: $43 - $8 = $35.
   - Subtract the coupon: $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

The final numerical answer is:
19"
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- State tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."

- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have together.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. Adding these together gives us the total number of guns:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Now, we need to divide this total number of guns equally among the four people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ). So we divide 24 by 4:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 6 guns. 

The final numerical answer is 6."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we first calculate the sugar required for the suckers and then for the fudge.

For the suckers:
- 1 batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, 8 batches of suckers will require \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

For the fudge:
- 1 batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, 1 batch of fudge will require 70 ounces of sugar.

Adding these together:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces
- Total sugar needed = 310 ounces

So, the final numerical answer is 310 ounces."
"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, I'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total value of Maria's shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

Step 1: Initial total value of Maria's shares
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
Initial total value = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

Step 2: Value of the shares after the first year's increase
The stock price increases by 50%.
Increase in value = 50% of $64 = 0.50 * $64 = $32
Value after first year = Initial total value + Increase in value
Value after first year = $64 + $32 = $96

Step 3: Value of the shares after the second year's decrease
The stock price decreases by 25%.
Decrease in value = 25% of $96 = 0.25 * $96 = $24
Value after second year = Value after first year - Decrease in value
Value after second year = $96 - $24 = $72

The final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:
\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month, given that he increases his daily distance by 1/5 of his original distance.

First, let's determine the new daily distance Tyson runs:
- Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters.
- The increase in distance is 1/5 of 5000 meters, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- Therefore, the new daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

Now, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June:
- Total distance = Daily distance \(\times\) Number of days
- Total distance = 6000 meters/day \(\times\) 30 days

Let's perform the multiplication:
- Total distance = 6000 \(\times\) 30 = 180,000 meters

The total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters.

"To calculate how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to determine the discount amount for one shirt and then find the total cost for two shirts.

The original price of one shirt is $30. A 40% discount on one shirt means Davos pays 60% of the original price (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

So, the price of one shirt after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.60 = 18 \]

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, the total cost for the 2 shirts is:
\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory makes per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

Now, let's find the difference in daily earnings:
- The difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

Finally, let's calculate the percentage increase:
- The percentage increase = (Difference / Original Amount) * 100
- The percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The percentage more they are making per day now is 10%."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.

Total time for shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The shows and boating/swimming together account for 30% of the total time spent. Let's denote the total time spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 9 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours.

\[ 0.30 \times T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

- She also wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.

Adding these costs together:
\[ 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Morgan's total budget is $90. After subtracting the cost of the activities she wants to do, the remaining budget is:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

This remaining $60 can be used to buy tickets for her friends. Since each ticket costs $5, the number of friends she can invite is:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the lollipops.
2. Determine the daily change Marisa saves.
3. Calculate the total savings over 5 days.

First, let's find the daily cost of the lollipops. Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. Therefore, the daily cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the daily cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 100 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Therefore, the daily change she saves is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

So, the total amount spent on gumballs is $2. This means the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 5.3333 pounds."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to determine how many miles the train travels before needing service. The train needs service every 18,000 miles.

We divide the total distance traveled in one day by the distance between services:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles/service = 0.0375 service days/day.

Since the train needs service every 18,000 miles, it will go 18,000 miles in 18,000 miles ÷ 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

Since the train cannot go a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number, which means the train goes between services every 27 days.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
27"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time John spent driving.

First, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to return home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time for detour} + \text{Time to return home} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So,

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip time is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we know that 5 girls were absent on Friday. Since the total number of absentees is 5 girls and 4 boys, the number of absent boys is 4. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, I'll first calculate the total points she has already scored on her first two tests and then find out how many more points she needs to reach the required total of 42 points.

Points scored on the first test: 15
Points scored on the second test: 18

Total points scored on the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many more points she needs, we subtract the points she has already scored from the required total:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Customers Refused to Wear Masks:**
   - Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks = 3.

2. **Shoplifting:**
   - Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 4 * (number of customers) - 5.
   - Substituting the number of customers: 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7.

3. **Physical Violence:**
   - Number of people kicked out for physical violence = 3 * (number of shoplifters).
   - Substituting the number of shoplifters: 3 * 7 = 21.

Now, let's sum up the number of people kicked out for each reason:
- Customers for masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence: 21

Total number of people kicked out for these reasons:
3 + 7 + 21 = 31.

Given that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
50 - 31 = 19.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 19."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the points Erin had before the additional 14 points.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate how many points Erin has now:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we know Erin has 24 points after scoring 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, we subtract the 14 points from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost, let's break down the expenses:

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 * 44 = 11 seniors will receive cords.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pieces of equipment purchased and then calculate the cost of the functioning pieces.

First, let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \). According to the problem, 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. Therefore, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces:
\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will have to pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to get the total amount she will pay back.

The formula for calculating the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Given:
- Principal = $3,650
- Interest Rate = 10% or 0.10
- Time = 5 months

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.5 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 1825 \]

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5475 \]

Since Karan has to pay this total amount back over five months, the amount she has to pay per month is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:

\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
x = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is made up of 52 members and 50% are girls, the remaining 50% must be boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

So, the choir has 26 girls and 26 boys, making a total of 52 members.

Next, the choir decides to perform with just its female members. Therefore, the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. This means that only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 \text{ (female members)} + 3 \text{ (teachers)} = 16

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets, we need to calculate the cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Therefore, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha would need 9 rides * $4 per ride = $36.

Now, we compare the total costs:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
- Savings = Dasha's cost - David's cost
- Savings = $36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to first find out the total number of gifts she is wrapping and then divide the total inches of ribbon by this number.

Monica has:
- 6 gifts to wrap for her family
- 4 gifts to wrap for her friends
- 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers

So, the total number of gifts is:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per gift

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each has:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will be getting:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. So, the savings per month for Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $10, which is $10 * 0.20 = $2.
- Therefore, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount is $10 - $2 = $8 per month each.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount:
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Adding the cost of Netflix:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8

Total monthly cost for streaming services:
$10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu) + $8 (Disney Plus) = $26

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. By cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services, he saves:
$60 (cable package cost) - $26 (streaming services cost) = $34

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. I'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that time recording it, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 120 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 90 \text{ minutes (editing)} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is:
\[ 20\% \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of spaces available in the shelving system.

The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in this shelving system. Let's denote the number of books Wendy wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x \) is 20 more than double the number of spaces, which is 36. So we can write:
\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]
\[ x = 72 + 20 \]
\[ x = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.
- Adding the cards Erica made and the cards her dad brought, we get \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She gave 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she has:

\[ 50 - 24 - 5 + 17 = 42 \]

So, Erica now has 42 Valentine's cards."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices in the pizza is 12. Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we first need to calculate how much more money he needs and then determine how many days it will take him to earn that amount.

Mark currently has $50 and the bike costs $300. Therefore, he needs an additional:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to work to earn $250, we divide the amount he needs by his daily earnings:
\[ \frac{250}{10} = 25 \text{ days} \]

So, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old, Beth, who is 5 years older than Erica, is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. Alice, who is 7 years older than Beth, is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 42 - 30 = 12 years. 

The final numerical answer is 12."

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour.
2. Determine the daily energy consumption after the reduction.
3. Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

First, the air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the air conditioner uses 0.9 kilowatts (kW) per hour.

Next, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage time is 8 - 5 = 3 hours. Therefore, the daily energy consumption after the reduction is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kW-hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how much energy is saved in 30 days. The original daily energy consumption was:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kW-hours} \]

So, the total energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kW-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} - 2.7 \text{ kW-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 216 \text{ kW-hours} - 81 \text{ kW-hours} = 135 \text{ kW-hours} \]

Therefore, the number of kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \text{ kW-hours} \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

135"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33 \]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is approximately 29.33."
"To solve this, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, let's determine how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. The number of corns is twice the number of cannolis, so initially, Allan has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. The number of corns he bought is 40 fewer than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) corns.
5. The new total of corns is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the new totals of corns and cannolis:

\[100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 100 \text{ (corns)} = 200\]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby starts reading 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he will be:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ minutes early} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[

     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of taffy: $4.50
Cost of seashells: $1.50
Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from the $10 she was given:
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $3.00."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days. 

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and that 100% of these dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are not dangerous, meaning 1% of the candles are dangerous.

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50000 = 500 \]

Next, we know that 5% of the dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"First, let's calculate the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price for each blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A \).

First, we calculate the number of apples Joanne gathers from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, Joanne gathers 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, Joanne gathers half of 30, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- From the average trees, Joanne gathers \( A \) apples.

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A = 45 + A \]

Next, we calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from each type of tree:
- From the tallest trees, her sister gathers twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- From the shortest trees, her sister gathers three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- From the average trees, her sister gathers 0 apples.

So, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (45 + A) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 45 + A + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A = 500 \]
\[ A = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A = 350 \]

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

We know that:
1. Each camel has 1 head and 2 humps.
2. Each dromedary has 1 head and 1 hump.
3. The total number of heads is 180.
4. The total number of humps is 304.

From the information given, we can set up the following system of equations:

\[ C + D = 180 \]
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):

\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):

\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, there are 56 dromedaries."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
- Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- Total distance for the first 4 days = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
- Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

Then, Tom didn't travel at all on the next day, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

For the remaining 2 days of the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day:
- Distance traveled in the last 2 days = 300 km/day * 2 days = 600 km.

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the next day + Distance for the last 2 days
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 600 km = 1640 km.

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 1640 kilometers."
"Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker size is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker size is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches.

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. 

\[
\boxed{40}

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is:

10,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 7,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"The second bank gave Mr. Josue twice the amount of the first bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000. 

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital, we get:

$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (initial capital) = $17000.

So, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is $17000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with the given pricing structure, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the different rates.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months:
- The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost for the next 2 months is $12 per month.
- Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the remaining 8 months (months 9 to 16):
- The cost for the remaining 8 months is $14 per month.
- Total cost for the remaining 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

Finally, let's add up all the costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
- Total cost = Cost for the first 6 months + Cost for the next 2 months + Cost for the remaining 8 months
- Total cost = $48 + $24 + $112 = $184.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $184."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine how much he saved from each. The total savings is $6, so 1/3 of $6 is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest, which is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

This $4 was saved from the tattered jeans. Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day. The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, while her own bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we multiply the number of feeders by the number of birds each feeder attracts:

\[ 6 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 180 \text{ birds per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. To find 25% of $4, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the soup is:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, which gives him:
\[ \text{Total money from selling cards} = \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 1x = x \]

He has $50 in spending cash, and the ticket costs $100, so the total amount of money he needs is:
\[ x + 50 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 100 - 50 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if only half of the guests had been expected to eat two hotdogs.

The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests, but 40 guests showed up. Half of 36 guests would be:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]
So, the caterer prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hotdogs each. This means the caterer prepared:
\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. The caterer only had 36 hotdogs prepared, so the number of guests who could not get a second hotdog is:
\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first need to calculate half the number of letters in Indras' name and then add 4 to that number.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Half of 6 is 3. Adding 4 to 3 gives us 7. So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7).

6 + 7 = 13

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $1."
"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.**
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Thaddeus} = 100

2. **Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.**
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

3. **Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.**
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]

4. **Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.**
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

"First, let's determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5. To find out how much money he spent, we calculate 99% of $5:

\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars.

Next, we know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents. Since George bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops among his four friends. Each friend would receive \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This makes a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

Oranges per person = 56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00 for the total ingredients.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

$12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater from his hotel.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- Therefore, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, he will arrive at the theater in \(4 + 4 = 8\) minutes after he leaves his hotel.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave her apartment 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's arrival time. Since Wayne will arrive 8 minutes after he leaves, Bernadette should leave 8 - 5 = 3 minutes before Wayne leaves.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 3 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the width of the room first, and then use that to find the perimeter.

Given:
- Area of the room = 360 square feet
- Length of the room = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:

"To determine the final temperature of the house, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Total temperature increase from baking = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.

   Therefore, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window**:
   - Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from opening the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.

   Therefore, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is:
\[

"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time for the run for James as \( R \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score: 214 points
Points scored by Joey: 26 points
Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Points scored by Marcy: 10 points
Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score:
Difference = Joey's new score - Marcy's new score
Difference = 240 - 235 = 5 points

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each.

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, let's find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

These 31 sneakers were sold to the department store for $25 each.

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both sales:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is $539."

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This can be expressed as:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the original cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20 \text{ balloons}} = \$45 \text{ per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \text{ per balloon} \]

Now, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \text{ balloons} \times \$65 \text{ per balloon} = \$11050 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 of them, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies she received in the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \]

Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the value of the 2 rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ 6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then add those amounts together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for his raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 is \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

4. **Total Cards**: To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
   - Total cards = Red cards + Green cards + Yellow cards
   - Total cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Thus, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we first need to determine the total number of Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate the number of Pomeranians as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

Next, we know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranians is:

\[ \text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia, I will first add up the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of locations.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, I will add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -28 degrees Fahrenheit

Next, I will divide the sum by the number of locations, which is 3:
-28 / 3 = -9.333333333333333 degrees Fahrenheit

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -9.33 degrees Fahrenheit."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

The child saves $2 daily. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To determine how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and then subtract the number of eggs Jaime has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. Therefore, the total capacity of the trays is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

Thus, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray is:
\[ 16 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, which costs $8, we can find the cost of the family-size pizza by multiplying $8 by 3:

\[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, to find out how much Sally spends in all, we add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the family-size pizza:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost of Razors:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 packs without any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Discount:**
   - The razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer.
   - This means for every 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount is:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon to the discounted price, the final cost is:
     \[
     4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Therefore, 2 packs contain:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - The total cost after all discounts is $2.00.
   - To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
     \[
     \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor}
     \]

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per razor in cents is:
     \[
     0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer in cents is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{(9 \times 64) + 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of girls in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of each cheerleader is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is:

\[
\boxed{53}
\]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she works. Since she works for 8 hours each day, the total minutes she walks each day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total minutes she walks is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To find Angela's current age, let's set up the problem with a variable. Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years Angela will be \( 14 \times 3 = 42 \) years old.

So, if \( A \) is Angela's current age, then in four years, her age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's determine the number of rides Paul took each day:
- Morning ride: 1
- Afternoon ride: 1

So, the total number of rides per day is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides over the 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ 224 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to determine how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 25n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 25:
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Next, Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.

Adding the gifts for her friends and the additional gifts:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[26\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Therefore, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final numerical answer is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Since she bought four packs of gum in total, and two of them were strawberry, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. And she bought a small pack of green apple gum, which she paid half as much as the grape gum, so the cost of the green apple gum is \( \frac{2}{2} = $1 \).

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of using 2 x 4 pieces of wood versus 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 4 piece of wood = $4
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 4 = 200
  - Cost per stick = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 8 piece of wood = $6
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 8 = 400
  - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should use as many 2 x 8 pieces of wood as possible within his budget of $24.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make:
- Total number of sticks = 4 pieces * 400 sticks per piece = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 8 pieces of wood) is 1600."
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of legs Mario's 6 sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs (and thus the total number of snowshoes needed) is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Since each dog needs one pair of snowshoes, Mario will need 6 pairs of snowshoes. The total cost is then:

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 72 \]"
"To calculate how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to determine how much she spends on bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the amount she would save by buying the pass instead of paying for each trip individually is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the question states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm).

The zoo has 20 sheep and 40 cows (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the question states the zoo has 20 sheep, which is consistent with the zoo having 40 cows).

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals at the farm and the zoo together:

Farm animals: 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals
Zoo animals: 40 cows + 20 sheep = 60 animals

Total animals: 45 (farm) + 60 (zoo) = 105 animals

The final numerical answer is 105."
"If Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, and Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following equations to find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought.

Let \( S_o \) be the number of onions Sophia bought and \( S_p \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought. According to the problem, we have:

\[ 4(S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 4(S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:

\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes combined. 

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and he knows that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his goal date, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. We count the days from December 31st to July 19th:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from January 1st to February 28th is 31 + 28 = 59 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to February 28th is 59 + 31 = 90 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to March 31st is 90 + 30 = 120 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to April 30th is 120 + 31 = 151 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to May 31st is 151 + 30 = 181 days.
- July has 19 days, so from July 1st to June 30th is 181 + 19 = 200 days.

So, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is 200 days.

To find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ days}} = 525 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal. The final numerical answer is:

1. Amount spent on clothes = 20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100
2. Remaining money after buying clothes = $500 - $100 = $400
3. Amount spent on CDs = 25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100
4. Remaining money after buying CDs = $400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

So, the final numerical answer is $288."

   Chris completed 12 problems on Monday. On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total problems completed by Tuesday} = 12 \text{ (Monday)} + 36 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Tuesday} = 100 - 48 = 52
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of problems completed on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Wednesday} = \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of problems completed by the end of Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total problems completed by Wednesday} = 48 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 13 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 61
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Wednesday} = 100 - 61 = 39
   \]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

The final numerical answer is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left, we need to subtract the number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold:
- In the morning, they sold 93 loaves.
- In the afternoon, they sold 39 loaves.

So, the total number of loaves sold is:
93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

Next, we add the loaves returned by the grocery store:
- The grocery store returned 6 loaves.

Now, we subtract the total number of loaves sold and returned from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (total baked) - 132 (sold) - 6 (returned) = 62 loaves.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 62."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows of red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.

The number of rows of red tulips is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips per row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of rows of blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.

The number of rows of blue tulips is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips per row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

Now, we sum the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows Jackson will plant:
\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to figure out how much raisins she will have for each of the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix) after dividing the bag of raisins equally.

The total amount of raisins is 27 cups. If she divides the raisins equally among the three items, each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. Therefore, the number of batches she can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \(12 \times 1.50 = 18\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity after adding the new device:
- The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(12 + 2 = 14\) kilowatts per hour.
- The daily cost is \(14 \times 1.50 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly cost before adding the new device is \(18 \times 7 = 126\) dollars.
- The weekly cost after adding the new device is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference between the weekly costs:
- The difference is \(147 - 126 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is 21 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints a house.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is one-fourth of a house. Therefore, the rate of one person is 1/4 of a house per day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint 5 * (1/4) = 5/4 of a house in one day.

To paint a whole house, they would need to paint 4/4 of a house. Since they can paint 5/4 of a house in one day, we can calculate the number of days it would take for them to paint a whole house by dividing 1 (the whole house) by their combined rate (5/4 of a house per day):

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{1}{5/4} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ days} \]

To convert this into hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[ \text{Number of hours} = \frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she also has 22 sofas.
5. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so the total for Ophelia is \(20 + 22 = 42\).
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so the total for Jenna is \(64 + 66 = 130\).

Adding these totals together, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is \(42 + 130 = 172\).

The final numerical answer is 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $48. Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could have bought with $48. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom would have been able to buy is:
\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week, taking into consideration the exceptions.

First, let's calculate the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to account for the exceptions:
- He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which adds:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
- He spent 6 hours in one week, which adds:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add these exceptions to the total:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 48 \text{ hours} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on than those who got off (which is 21). So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 in 8 years, which means:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

So, Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is 22 years old now, and his cousin is 47 years old now. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of years separating the age of Jame and his cousin now is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + 2M + P = 2400 \)
2. \( C = 1100 \)
3. \( P = C - 400 \)

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the third equation:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substituting the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( \$300 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl.

First, let's establish the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we know that each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The problem states that each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, each girl brought:
\[ 60 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 60 \text{ seashells} = 60 \text{ seashells} + 240 \text{ seashells} = 300 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 10 \text{ girls} \times 300 \text{ seashells/girl} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

However, the question specifically asks for the number of seashells brought by each girl, which is:
\[ 300 \text{ seashells} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

"To find Anne's age, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now that we know Alyana is 6 years old, we can find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, I will calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, I will add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[ 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 \]

Let's perform the addition step by step:

\[ 31 + 50 = 81 \]
\[ 81 + 45 = 126 \]
\[ 126 + 62 = 188 \]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To calculate the total amount I ended up paying, I first need to calculate the tip and then add it to the original dinner bill.

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount I paid is the original dinner bill plus the tip:

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share: $6 + $5 = $11.
   - The following day, he adds another $10: $11 + $10 = $21.
   - He then spends $8: $21 - $8 = $13.

3. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - After spending $8, he has $13.
   - He triples the amount he has left: $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's denote the number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. This means that if he saves \( x \) dollars per day in the first half, he will save \( 2x \) dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month can be expressed as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. The first half of April consists of 15 days, and the second half consists of 15 days.

The total savings for the month can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total savings} = 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis has to save $25 per day in the first half of the month. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he has to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $7.00."

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 80 \]"

   - Commission earned: \( 1500 \times 0.10 = $150 \)

3. **Total commission earned:**
   - Total commission: $300 (first $1000) + $150 (over $1000) = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 from selling goods worth $2500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case contains 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles Bill needs for his 70 guests, with each guest receiving 2 bottles of water:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles Bill currently has from the total number of bottles he needs:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water.

1. **Cold Water:**
   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Warm Water:**
   - It is stated that Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it takes in cold water.
   - Twice the time it takes in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this, we get \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

3. **Cold Water for 3 Miles:**
   - Time for 1 mile = 16 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Warm Water for 3 Miles:**
   - Time for 1 mile = 34 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water.

5. **Difference in Time:**
   - Time for 3 miles in warm water = 102 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles in cold water = 48 minutes.
   - Difference = \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. 

The final numerical answer is:
54 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can find this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ dollars}}{40 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. Since Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan's weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob's weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight of the three friends, we sum their weights and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

Let's calculate the sum of their weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \]

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[ 180 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much James spends on candles, we first need to determine the total number of candles he needs.

The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

So, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, which totals to 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate how many pages she reads in 105 minutes. First, we find out how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 105 minutes:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she reads 2 pages in each 1.5-minute interval, the total number of pages she reads in the first week is:
\[ 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

"To solve this, let's set up an equation based on the information given:

Shiloh's current age is 44 years. In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

Let's denote the nephew's current age as \( x \). In 7 years, the nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So we can write the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 30 = 3x \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old. 

The final numerical answer is 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for these three teeth, she received a total of $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. So, for these two teeth, she received a total of $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we sum up all the money Sharon received:
- $5.00 for the first tooth
- $3.00 for the next three teeth
- $1.00 for the last two teeth

Adding these amounts together:
$5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

Therefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and he wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate:
\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he spends money on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for wooden action figures is:
\[ \text{Cost of wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $20 on wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:
\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

Therefore, the total cost for Leah so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for 10 sandwiches:

- Cost of bread: $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, for 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread, which costs $3.00.
- Cost of cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- For 10 sandwiches, the total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this starting value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Let's denote the number as \( N \). So, the first operation can be written as:
   \[
   \frac{S + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting \( S = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. So, the second operation can be written as:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times (20 - 12)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**: To find the final value, we need to know the value of \( N \). However, since \( N \) is not specified in the problem, we assume \( N \) is the same as the starting value \( S \), which is 20. Substituting \( N = 20 \) into the expression:
   \[
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{20}{2}}{5} \right) \times 8
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

So, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature. Now, we need to apply this same 4% error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

To find the actual temperature that corresponds to 520 degrees, we need to account for the 4% error. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 520 \times (1 + 0.04) = 520 \times 1.04 = 540.8 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees in her recipe.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 540.8 \]"

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial 24 dishes, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12\) (initial) + \(28\) (friend) = \(40\) cups.
Judy's total dishes: \(24\) (initial) + \(44\) (friend) = \(68\) dishes.

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\(40\) cups + \(68\) dishes = \(108\) utensils.

The final numerical answer is:

To find the discount amount:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is $90.00.

Next, we need to find the total cost for 2 boxes at the discounted price:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- We divide the total calories burned by the calories per 100 ml of water.
- Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories per 100 ml) * 100 ml
- Water needed = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we get:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we calculate:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we first need to determine the typing speed for the third test. The initial speed is 47 WPM, and after the first increase, it becomes 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words per minute, the third test speed will be:

\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

First, we calculate the sum:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Then, we divide the sum by 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[ 52 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference in weight is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain twice as much protein, which is:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake by multiplying the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
13"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one gumball:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate Marissa's hourly rate as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, I'll break it down into two parts: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- He sold 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, the earnings for the first 4 hours were 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- He sold 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, the earnings for the next 2 hours were 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Adding the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = $30 (first 4 hours) + $12 (next 2 hours) = $42.

Therefore, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

Total rotations per month = (400 miles / 2 miles per rotation cycle) * 725 rotations
Total rotations per month = 200 * 725
Total rotations per month = 145,000 rotations

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

Months the tires can last = 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month
Months the tires can last = 72 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can now calculate how many years the tires can last:

Years the tires can last = 72 months / 12 months per year
Years the tires can last = 6 years

So, the final numerical answer is 6 years."
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the directions say that 2 pumps give 120 washes, we can calculate the number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since the bottle gives 120 washes and each pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \text{Number of pumps} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is also a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

\[ \$65,560 \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - Therefore, the funding per month for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars.

3. **Total Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Cost for the extended 45 months: \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding: 
   \[
   100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add the meat consumed by the first three players:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the number of days in March and then multiply it by the average number of posts per day per member.

March has 31 days.

Given that each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 posts per day, the total number of posts per day for the entire group is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry he does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.
2. Determine the total amount of meat from the bull.
3. Calculate the number of days it will take to sell the total amount of meat.

First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we know that Bill's bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:

3. Calculate the number of seats remaining after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. The number of seats remaining after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights available.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:
\[ 4 \text{ intersections} \times 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Given that 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving some to his sister:
   \[
   20 - 4 - 1 - 1 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Half of 14 pieces is:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister, leaving him with:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
\[
\boxed{7}

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, on each of the remaining days, the tow truck pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Since there are 4 remaining days in the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), the total number of cars towed on these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will need 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

10 cars * $25,000 per car = $250,000

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost the company paid for the cars is:

30% of $250,000 = 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

The profit James made from selling the cars is the total sales minus the cost the company paid:

$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

So, the final numerical answer is $17,500."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a diamond jewel:**
   Given as $2000.

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \]

Then, we calculate the number of rose stamps. The problem states that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of stamp to find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can follow these steps:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is calculated as follows:

\[
x = \frac{60}{10} = 6
\]

According to the parents' condition, if the cost per class exceeds $10, they will not sign him up again. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can miss any number of classes without the parents deciding not to sign him up again.

Thus, Manny can miss all 10 classes and still meet the parents' condition.

The final numerical answer is:

\[

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) it will take him to dig the hole is:

Given that a bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms."
"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked individually and then add those distances together.

Alisa's distance:
Speed = 12 miles per hour
Time = 4.5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Stanley's distance:
Speed = 10 miles per hour
Time = 2.5 hours
Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together:
Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Finally, we sum the times to get the total time:
- Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 10 hours."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the sales from green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from red hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find the total sales in the second month. According to the problem, the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total sales in the first month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we can calculate the total sales over the two months by adding the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales over two months} = \text{Total sales in the first month} + \text{Sales in the second month} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is:

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - Total time hired = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Effective paid time = Total time hired - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours:**
   - The first hour is $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour.
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum the costs for the paid hours:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first hour + Cost for the second hour + Cost for the third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine the difference between the amount in her bank account at the end of the week and the amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage.

The amount in her bank account at the end of the week is $420.
The amount she should have in her bank account if she had received her full weekly wage of $300 is $300.

The difference, which represents the amount withheld, is calculated as follows:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total time it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork.
   - Total time = time for rice + time for beans + time for pork
   - Total time = \(30 + 40 + 50 = 120\) minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we first need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

1. **Cost of the first mixture:**

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep,
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads is 20.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, substitute \( g \) in the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
1. Calculate 20% of $5:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]
2. Add this amount to the original price:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \]
So, the more expensive brand costs $6 per pound.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost is the sum of the coffee cost and the donut cost:

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day if she works 3 hours. We do this by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes as \( x \).

The proportion can be written as:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]
\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]
\[ x = 6 \times 96 \]
\[ x = 576 \]

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ \text{Katarina's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ 68 = \text{Max's cookies} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ 298 \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation for the final length as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode, we need to find the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

For ""turtle"" mode:
- Half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it would take \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode.

For ""rabbit"" mode:
- Half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it would take \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, we add the time spent in each mode to find the total time:
- Time spent in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. They have 30 minutes in total.
2. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
3. It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

First, we add the time they have already spent walking:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write the equation:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total time he has before dinner:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of the five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.

Therefore, the total number of coins Rong has saved in ten years is:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil has saved in ten years. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. 

First, we calculate how many more coins Neil saves per month compared to Rong:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ coins/month} \]

So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Neil has saved in ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, to find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have together after ten years, we add the coins saved by each:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price for a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum them up.

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Finally, we sum these costs to find the total price for the crate:
\[5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0\]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:

"To find the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used for industrial purposes by the city.
2. Subtract this percentage from 100% to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by the city is:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\% \]

Next, to find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes by the city, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

\[ 100\% - 32\% = 68\% \]

So, the percent of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is:

\[ 68\% \]

Now, we calculate the total production for 48 hours for both types of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The total production in 48 hours is:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]

For vanilla ice cream:
- The total production in 48 hours is:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to find the total production in 48 hours:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $49.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $49.00 = 0.10 * $49.00 = $4.90

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $49.00 - $4.90 = $44.10

So, Marcus' total bill is $44.10."
"To solve this, let's first understand the deal: for every 2 scoops of ice cream bought, Erin gets 1 scoop for free. This means for every 3 scoops of ice cream, she only pays for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 2 scoops, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. We need to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00.

First, we divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger and Amy have left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\) pieces.

Therefore, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total bathroom area.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's start with step 1:

The total area of the bathroom is 36 sq ft. Two thirds of this area is:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, for step 2:

Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost James paid for picking the blueberries. He paid a flat fee of $20 plus $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds of blueberries.

The cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost James paid for picking the blueberries is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound.

The cost of buying 30 pounds at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost he paid for picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store.

The savings are:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original planned price for each computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]
So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. The total amount of money they paid is:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, I'll add up the calories from each ingredient:

- Eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories each = 450 calories
- Cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories per ounce = 240 calories
- Ham: 2 oz * 40 calories per ounce = 80 calories

Now, I'll add these up:

450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories

The total number of calories in the omelet is 770 calories."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

The cost of one pencil is $0.50, so the cost of 6 pencils is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

The cost of one eraser is $0.25, so the cost of 8 erasers is:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the pencils and erasers. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change you would get is:
\[ 5.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, we have:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these interviewees receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

Now, we know that a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position. Therefore, we calculate the number of people who accept the position as follows:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, the number of people who accept the position is 2."
"Goldy gave away a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which sums up to 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

So, the total number of boxes bought this week is:
3 + 5 = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:
8 - 4 = 4 boxes

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she dances.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

For 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 minutes):
- Total taps = 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

For 2 minutes (since her arms are raised for 2 minutes):
- Total taps = 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:
- Total taps = 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

The final numerical answer is:
2450"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then compare it to the potential damage to his car.

1. **Damage to the car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - The damage is $450.

2. **Cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75
   - Total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195

3. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**
   - Money saved = Potential damage - Cost of fixing the pothole
   - Money saved = $450 - $195 = $255

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the number of normal chairs left and the number of baby chairs left to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:
- Normal chairs left: 150
- Baby chairs left: 10
- Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of friends including Bryce**: 1 (Bryce) + 4 (friends) = 5 friends.
2. **Total number of pizzas**: 5 friends * 1 pizza each = 5 pizzas.
3. **Total number of pizza slices**: 5 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices.

Now, let's calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends:

- **Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas**:
  - Each of these 3 friends ate 2/3 of their pizza.
  - Each pizza has 12 slices, so 2/3 of a pizza is 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.
  - Therefore, each of these 3 friends ate 8 slices.
  - Total slices eaten by these 3 friends = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

Next, let's calculate how many slices were eaten by the remaining two friends:

- **The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas**:
  - Each of these 2 friends ate 3/4 of their pizza.
  - Each pizza has 12 slices, so 3/4 of a pizza is 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices.
  - Therefore, each of these 2 friends ate 9 slices.
  - Total slices eaten by these 2 friends = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the total number of slices eaten by all friends:

- Total slices eaten = 24 slices (by Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (by the remaining two friends) = 42 slices.

Finally, to find out how many slices are left:

- Total slices initially = 60 slices.
- Total slices eaten = 42 slices.
- Slices left = 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18."
"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we have the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages:
- Cat: 30 minutes
- Dog: 20 minutes

To find the average time, we add the two times and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of Topher's shoe as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we have:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight of the math and science books is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the weight of her history book is:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]

Adding this to candidate A's votes:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. The votes received by candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes received by candidates A and B from the total votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to update the number of apples each person has after this exchange:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[
\text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3

"To determine how much water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is 2."

\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, 1/3 of the 12 birds were scared away. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, I'll follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

Step 1: Determine the number of students in each class.
- The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
- Since each class has the same amount of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.
- Number of students in each class = 80 / 2 = 40.

Step 2: Calculate the number of girls in each class.
- In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
- Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40 = 0.40 * 40 = 16.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boys in each class.
- Number of boys in each class = Total number of students in each class - Number of girls in each class.
- Number of boys in each class = 40 - 16 = 24.

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate, so the total number of slices became:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she had:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices, so the number of slices left was:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend then stole 5 slices from the plate, so the number of slices remaining was:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals ÷ 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1100}
\]"
"To calculate the savings, we first need to determine the total cost for Jake's family at each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $26 = $52.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $12 = $24.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $14 = $28.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $10 = $20.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

Now, to find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28.

So, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily cost from the new vendor:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The old vendor sold tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor sold 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily cost from the old vendor:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, we find the daily savings by subtracting the new vendor's cost from the old vendor's cost:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"To solve the problem, let's start by determining the number of marbles each person has based on the information provided.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, Cal has \( 56 \times 2 = 112 \) marbles.
3. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Carl has \( 56 \times 4 = 224 \) marbles.

Now, to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 336."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. We need to divide these students into 12 groups of equal size. To find the number of students per group, we perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, it's clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups of equal size. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, implying we need to find out how many groups are needed to accommodate all students.

To find out how many groups are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

\[ 54 \div 4.5 = 12 \]

This calculation shows that 54 students can be evenly divided into 12 groups of 4.5 students each. Since the question asks how many more groups are needed to form, and we already have 12 groups, no additional groups are needed.

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental numbers for weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Candy rents 60 chairs each weekday.
- Therefore, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekend:
- There are 2 days in a weekend.
- Candy rents 100 chairs each day of the weekend.
- Therefore, in one weekend, the number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- In one month, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(4 \times 300 = 1200\) chairs.
- The number of chairs rented on weekends is \(4 \times 200 = 800\) chairs.
- Therefore, in one month, the total number of chairs rented is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- In two months, the total number of chairs rented is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\) chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1200 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Since there are 4 roommates and they divide the cost equally, each roommate will pay:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ dollars/year}}{4 \text{ roommates}} = 300 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is \(8 \times 12 = 96\).
- He sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

Next, let's account for the broken items:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, we can calculate the number of glasses and plates that are still usable:

- The number of usable glasses is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- The number of usable plates is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, we add the usable glasses and plates together to find the total number of usable items:

- Total usable items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128.

So, the final numerical answer is 128."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are traded for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - After trading 27 small stickers, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, 20 large stickers are traded for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - After trading 20 large stickers, Lorraine has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, 20 large buttons are traded for \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is \(20 + 60 = 80\).

The final numerical answer is 80."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first need to find out how much the discount is in dollars.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the big race. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 people is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}P = 6 \]
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ P = 3 \times 9 \]
\[ P = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we add this amount to the $70 Jayden already had:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books Ahmed read as follows:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we are told that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. We add the number of books each of them read:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's total books} + \text{Ahmed's books} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the earnings from teaching:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 - 3 = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5/\text{day} = 1 \times 5 = \$5 \]

Now, add the additional earnings to the base earnings:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the earnings from teaching:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on soccer:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we find the percentage of the weekend spent on soccer:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer is:
\[ 50\% \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer in a separate line:

"To find out how many pencils Anthony kept, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Anthony initially had 50 pencils.
2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. So, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony had left after giving some to Brandon is:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25
   \]
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. So, the number of pencils given to Charlie is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]
   Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony had left after giving some to Charlie is:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10
   \]

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils. The final numerical answer is:

10"
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance back is the same, the time taken to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To find out how many wheels Henry will have left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He has 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He has 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has 650 wheels in his box. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels he has:
- Wheels left = total wheels in the box - total wheels required = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

So, the number of wheels left is 276."

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mike has 600 movies in total.
- A third of the movies are in various series, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
- The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, which means \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older.
- The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, which are normal movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost of replacing the movies:

- The cost of the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
- The cost of the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
- The cost of the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking.

First, let's calculate the distance covered by driving. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance covered by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. First, we find half of their driving speed:

\[ \text{Half of driving speed} = \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Then, we find the hiking speed:

\[ \text{Hiking speed} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

Now, we calculate the distance covered by hiking:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances covered by driving and hiking to find the total distance to the vacation spot:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \).

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T_A = T_E + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times (T_E - T_A) \)

Substituting the given differences:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \)

Now, we can calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma.

Ava's total score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 80 + 15 + 120 = 215 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times (E_E - E_E) + 5 \times (B_E - B_E) + 30 \times (T_E - T_E) = 0 \]

The difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} = 215 - 0 = 215 \]

The difference between their two scores is 215."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. 

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. If two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, then the combined cost of these two pizzas is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from the total cost of the four pizzas gives us the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on regular days.
   - Twice the usual times on the other two days means they ride their bikes six times a day on those days.

2. **Number of Regular Days and Other Days:**
   - There are 5 days in a week.
   - Two of these days are the ""other days"" where they ride six times a day.
   - The remaining three days are the ""regular days"" where they ride three times a day.

3. **Calculating Biking Frequency for Regular Days:**
   - On regular days, they ride 3 times a day.
   - There are 3 regular days in a week.
   - Total biking on regular days = 3 times/day * 3 days = 9 times.

4. **Calculating Biking Frequency for Other Days:**
   - On other days, they ride 6 times a day.
   - There are 2 other days in a week.
   - Total biking on other days = 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

5. **Total Biking Frequency for the Week:**
   - Total biking in a week = Biking on regular days + Biking on other days
   - Total biking in a week = 9 times + 12 times = 21 times.

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 21."
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify this equation:

\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):

\[ o = 17 - w \]

Substitute this expression for \( o \) into the second equation:

\[ 17 - w - 2w = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3w = 5 \]
\[ -3w = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3w = -12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o + w = 17 \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \( 4 \). 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the hours Kris has already played:

1. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days):
   \( 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \)

2. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week (7 days):
   \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \)

Adding these together gives the total hours played so far:
\( 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \)

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\( 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \)

So, the final numerical answer is 9 hours."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we first need to calculate the cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

This is the cost of the ring before the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find the premium, we calculate 30% of $900:

\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost of the ring to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long he can make his mosaic, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many more candies he needs to sell to have all of his candy, we subtract the number of candies he already has from the total number of candies he ordered and received:

200 (total candies now) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- At the end of February, the number of students is \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- At the end of March, the number of students is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- At the end of April, the number of students is \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- At the end of May, the number of students is \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who have joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Since this was the total for the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Branches per day} = 60 \text{ branches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 60 branches per day."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

First, she picks:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together, the total number of petals she picks is:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

When she drops 1 of each type of flower, she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals she drops is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the total, the number of petals remaining in the vase is:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they use 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows lost is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the 14 marshmallows left. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person in minutes. Jack and his two worse friends can each play for 20 minutes, while the better friend can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

The total play time for Jack and his two worse friends is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The better friend plays for 30 minutes. So, the total play time for all four friends is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Since they play for 4 hours, we need to convert 4 hours into minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 20-minute intervals fit into 240 minutes:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 12 \text{ games} \]

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. To express this as a decimal, it is approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer in fractional form is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially:**
   - We know that Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate how many cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Therefore, he remains with \(40 - 8 - 16 = 16\) cars.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide $125,000 by 20:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, the number of hours she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Sandy walked over the two days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the earnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00.
   - Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00/day.

2. Calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = $180.00/day * 7 days/week = $1,260.00/week.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins.

Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins.

Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total tins of dog food from the total tins of cat food.

Difference = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is 153."
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the book's purchase price Milly can get back. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

Now, we calculate how much Milly will lose by subtracting the refundable amount from the shipping cost:
\[ \$3.00 - \$2.40 = \$0.60 \]

"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is:
\[ \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we add the production from the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production in the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equals \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, the time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs based on the items she needs installed.

First, let's calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:

- Additional mirrors: Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors.
- Additional chandeliers: Angela needs 2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier.
- Additional pictures: Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures.

Now, let's calculate the cost for these additional items:

- Cost for additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Cost for additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Cost for additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Adding these costs together gives us the total cost for the additional items:

$30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Now, we add this to the base installation cost:

Base installation cost: $129.00
Additional items cost: $195.00

Total cost: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $324.00."

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches.

Now, to convert 480 inches to feet, we know that 1 foot = 12 inches. Therefore:

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 40 feet."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, which means he covers \(8 \times 4 = 32\) miles. After resting, he continues to travel for another 6 hours at the same rate, covering \(8 \times 6 = 48\) miles. Therefore, the total distance he has traveled is \(32 + 48 = 80\) miles. 

The final numerical answer is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the speed of the turtles.

Let's denote the speed of the kangaroos as \( v \) (in units of distance per hour). Since the kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \( D \) of the highway can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). We need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cover the same distance \( D \).

The time \( t \) it takes for four turtles to cover the distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} \times \text{number of turtles} \]
\[ t = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2}} \times 4 \]
\[ t = \frac{54v \times 2}{v} \times 4 \]
\[ t = 108 \times 4 \]
\[ t = 432 \]

So, it will take 432 hours for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 432 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Kora made 20 dishes.
- Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
- Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

Total dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80
Total dishes = 140

So, the final numerical answer is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to buy the laptop is $350, and she has $230, so the amount in her purse must be $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and Adam decides to slice 3 large apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and Adam decides to slice 5 small apples. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ slices} + 15 \text{ slices} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows. Since each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, the total milk production from 3 cows is:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many additional cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day. Each cow provides 5 liters of milk a day, so we need to find out how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time for the concert:
- Total time for the concert: 2 hours
- Convert hours to minutes: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \)

Subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 3/4 of the original amount = 3/4 * $300 = $225 per year
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times \frac{225}{100} \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

Now, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325."

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, let's calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm after the sales.

Initially, Farm X has 55 goats and Farm Y has 45 goats.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required for the 27 students. Each student needs 2 glue sticks, so:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. 

To ensure he has enough glue sticks and some extra, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

   - The difference is \(36 - 6 = 30\) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige baked:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours:
- Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour.
- Therefore, in 5 hours, she baked \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) banana bread loaves.

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from the 10 loaves:
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices is \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) slices.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 80 slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
- Therefore, the total revenue in cents is \( 80 \times 50 = 4000 \) cents.
- Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total revenue in dollars is \( \frac{4000}{100} = 40 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

Given that \( G = 70 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins \( S \), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = G + S \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total number of books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. We know that one box of jello makes 10 small jello cups:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of 12 boxes of jello. Each box costs $1.25:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month.

Given that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 per month, we can calculate her monthly payment as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces on the first day.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Remaining Pieces After First Day:**
   After eating 24 pieces on the first day, the remaining pieces are:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Second Day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

4. **Third Day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces on the third day.
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Total Pieces Eaten:**
   To find the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we add the pieces eaten on each day:
   \[
   24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is 48."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00.

First, we calculate the cost of one bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to know how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter and the total cost is $40, she will have:

\[
\text{Money left after selling the rope} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since she has no money left after selling the original rope, she cannot buy any new rope. Therefore, the amount of money she will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bacon} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10, a pack of chicken costs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so the total cost of chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 196 = -131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the items. She is short by:
\[
131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}

"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual concerts run for 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

Now, I'll add these numbers together:

\( 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \)

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones won't be paired. Since 20% of the microphones won't find space, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are to be arranged in pairs, we divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
- There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, the number of birds flying overhead is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, the number of birds feeding is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, let's add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \( 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \).

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \( 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \( 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \).

So, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for her daily diet is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original wage was $10 per hour, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month. We need to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

From the problem, we know that Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

Next, we know that Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total number of lawns mowed is the sum of the lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba:
\[ x + 3x + 5x = 9x \]

We are also given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn. Since Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6x \]

We know that the total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade add up to $80. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 6x + \text{earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade, we need to determine \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn, so we can only use the information about Joe's lawn to find \( x \). Since the problem does not give us the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn, we can assume that the earnings from mowing lawns are the only information we need to find the earnings from lemonade.

Given that the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 6x \), we can solve for \( x \) by assuming the simplest case where \( x = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the exact number of times mowed, we can use this to find the earnings from lemonade):
\[ 6 \times 1 = 6 \]
So, the earnings from mowing lawns is $6. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 6 = 74 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can find Carl's weight by adding 16 kg to Martin's weight:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from the total earnings:

$750 (total earnings) - $500 (car payment) = $250

So, the profit John makes on his car is $250."
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally did, he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. Therefore, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph. 

The final numerical answer is 1."
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel was not able to read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages read by each:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot and how it is divided among the family members.

Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult's bowls. This means the pot can fill 8 child's bowls (since 4 adult's bowls = 8 child's bowls).

Calvin, his wife, and their two children make a total of 4 people. Each person will have one bowl of soup. Therefore, 4 bowls of soup will be consumed in total.

Since the pot can fill 8 child's bowls, and 4 bowls are consumed, the leftover soup will be enough for:
\[ 8 \text{ child's bowls} - 4 \text{ child's bowls} = 4 \text{ child's bowls} \]

Each child can have one bowl of soup, and there are 2 children. Therefore, the leftover soup will be enough for each child to have one bowl, and there will be 2 bowls left over.

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and the number of times each child can have a bowl is:

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 1.50 \times 5 = 7.50 \]

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1 = 0.50 \]

Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

The final numerical answer is 16 yards."
"To find the average price Isabelle paid per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets she has purchased. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Isabelle has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Isabelle paid per ticket is $8. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and then subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
Free time = Total hours in a day - Total time spent on activities
Free time = 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.
2. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the remaining blue shoe boxes are \(7 - 3 = 4\).
3. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(9 \times \frac{1}{3} = 3\).
4. Therefore, the remaining red shoe boxes are \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is \(4 + 6 = 10\).

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the ages of Duncan and Adam in the past.

Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Let Adam's current age be \( A \). Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. In 8 years, Adam will be:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Therefore, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 acres:

\[ 2 \times 200 \text{ acres} = 400 \text{ acres} \]
\[ 400 \text{ acres} + 100 \text{ acres} = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:

\[ 200 \text{ acres} + 500 \text{ acres} = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres that the two farms have together is 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the question, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. 

So, the number of packages he completes per hour is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday, he completes:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, his earnings for the day are:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We are given that \( R = 20 \) and the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total pieces of bologna thrown can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting the value of \( R \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first need to calculate the total distance he drives in that period.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total distance driven is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups are needed:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, I'll calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, I'll sum the hours worked over the three days:

"Let's break down the expenses and the money they spent:

1. **Cake Cost**: $11
2. **Balloons Cost**: 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. **Ice Cream Cost**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice Cream: $14
- Total expenses: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received half of the total amount:
- Each one received: $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows, with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that each row has the same number of chamomile tea cups and the same number of mint tea cups.

Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \) (since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is equal). Therefore, the total number of chamomile tea cups is \( 3x \) and the total number of mint tea cups is also \( 3x \).

The total number of cups of tea is the sum of the chamomile tea cups, the mint tea cups, and the cinnamon tea cups. We know that the total number of cups is 27, and she brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea. So, the equation for the total number of cups is:

\[ 3x + 3x + 15 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6x + 15 = 27 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 12 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, the number of chamomile tea cups in each row is 2, and the number of mint tea cups in each row is also 2. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. We do this by dividing the total time available by the time per trip:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

\[

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water removed from the initial capacity of the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total cost for popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total cost for candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from the total amount of money he has:
- Colby has $150 initially.
- After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, he has \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars left.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10 per movie. We need to find out how many $10 tickets he can buy with $126:
- The number of movies he can see is \( \frac{126}{10} = 12.6 \).

Since he can only see whole movies, we take the integer part of the division, which is 12.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories from all the pastries:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40000 + 45000 = 85000

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance it travels is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance it travels is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spat their seeds.

Zoey's total distance:
Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.
\[ \text{Total distance for Zoey} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney's total distance:
Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet.
\[ \text{Total distance for Sydney} = 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney to find the combined total distance:
\[ \text{Combined total distance} = 400 + 420 = 820 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

- Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

Revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find the difference in revenue:
\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 12-hour and the 24-hour options, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The base cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 24 hours, which is exactly 24 hours, so there are no additional hours to pay for.

The cost for the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour option plus the additional hours:
- The base cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 24 hours, which means he has 12 additional hours.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours is 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The cost difference is 1840 pesos - 1600 pesos = 240 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 240 pesos by choosing the 12-hour option plus the additional hours instead of the 24-hour option."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \div 25 = 4 \]

So, John can buy 4 pens. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, and then sum these totals.

First, let's determine the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother to find the combined total:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice she can get from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the next whole hour to ensure Patty gets paid for the full hour. Thus, the labor cost is for 3 hours.
3. The parts cost: $60

Now, let's calculate the labor cost for 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Adding all these components together:
\[ \$40 + \$105 + \$60 = \$205 \]

Therefore, Patty charged:
\[ \$205 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original cost. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for them:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, I will multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, I will add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   Add the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17 \text{ hours}}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- He sells 6 copies.
- Each copy costs $5.
- His commission rate is 10%.

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from 6 copies of the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- He sells 10 copies.
- Each copy costs $15.
- His commission rate is 8%.

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission from 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ 15.00 \]"
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is:
\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, if Marcus is 21 years old, Leo's age is:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate the total number of reports he stapled.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

First, let's calculate the usual sleep duration:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- The total time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
- Converting 8 hours into minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time she was sleepwalking:
- She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
- The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

Then, let's calculate the time she woke up early:
- She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
- The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
- The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \( 5 \text{ hours } 40 \text{ minutes} \).
- Converting 5 hours and 40 minutes into minutes: \( 5 \times 60 + 40 = 340 \) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time she was not on her bed:
- Sleepwalking time: 23 minutes
- Early wake-up time: 340 minutes

Total time not spent on her bed: \( 23 + 340 = 363 \) minutes.

Finally, subtract this from her usual sleep duration to find the time she slept on her bed:
- Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
- Time not spent on her bed: 363 minutes
- Time spent on her bed: \( 480 - 363 = 117 \) minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 117 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining number of measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to find out how many patients are admitted into the hospital over a period of 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, we can calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days):

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can determine the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means Robyn sends six emails to her family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. We subtract the number of family emails from the total non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining three emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends one email to her boyfriend each day. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people:

\[ \text{Actual number of people} = \frac{\text{Reported number}}{1 + \text{Percentage over}} \]

Here, the reported number is 48 and the percentage over is 20%, or 0.20 in decimal form. Plugging in these values:

\[ \text{Actual number of people} = \frac{48}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, we perform the division:

\[ \text{Actual number of people} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they also filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that the island had four times as many holes by the end of the third day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Since the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over, let's calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number that were eaten.

First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta received:

- For herself, she made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
- At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies.
- At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she received:
12 (for herself) + 6 (from the office party) + 48 (from the friends' party) = 66 brownies.

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten:
18 brownies were eaten.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \(0.75 \times 8 = 6\) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, I will calculate the time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
\[ 3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, I will add up the total time:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break down the cost:

1. The first two phones cost $600 each.
2. The third phone is half the price of the first phone, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
3. The fourth phone is also half the price of the first phone, so it also costs $300.

Now, let's add up the total cost:

- Cost of the first phone: $600
- Cost of the second phone: $600
- Cost of the third phone: $300
- Cost of the fourth phone: $300

Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 = $1800

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Given that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:

12 boxes

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:

2 boxes to her mom + 2 boxes to her sister = 4 boxes

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so we need to find out how many boxes that represents:

1/4 of 12 boxes = 3 boxes

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:

12 boxes - 3 boxes = 9 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges she sold:

9 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 180 oranges

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 180 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
India has 4 more than this number, so:
Number of states in India = 25 + 4 = 29

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India to the number of states in the USA:

Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA
Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18

"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's dad's current age as \( D \) and his brother's current age as \( B \).

First, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, the difference in age between Emil and his dad will be \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years. At that time, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. So we can write the equation:

\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

To find \( D \), we solve the equation:

\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. So we can write the equation:

\[ 24 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:

\[ 24 = 2B \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:

\[ 43 + 12 = 55 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days:

- Total crawfish = Thursday's catch + Friday's catch + Saturday's catch
- Total crawfish = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

Given that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can now calculate the number of servings:

- Number of servings = Total crawfish / Crawfish per serving
- Number of servings = 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students, we get the total number of students leaving early:

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ new plants} \]

Each new plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for roses is:
- Remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
- Number of roses = Remaining soil for roses = 3.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \text{Total amount set aside per year} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we divide the total amount she can spend by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp and then multiply by the time it takes to sauté one set:

\[ \text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp in 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to sauté the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
- For 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on high for 4 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
- For 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was off for 2 hours:
- The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
- For 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Cooling on low: -6 degrees
- Cooling on high: -12 degrees
- Warming up: +4 degrees

The net temperature change is:
\[
-6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Since his father was 30 years old when he saw the comet, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

3. **Determine the age difference between the first and second sightings:**
   - The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting was 75 years after the first sighting.
   - Therefore, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, I'll add up the checks he writes for each category:

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter (which is 4 months)

First, let's calculate the total number of checks for each category per year:

1. Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
2. Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
3. Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Now, let's add them all together:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \), and the number of flights to France and Germany combined is \( \frac{1}{4}F \). Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{8}F \) and the number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France by the first plane. Since the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{8}F \), we substitute \( F = 88 \) into the equation:

\[
\text{Number of flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
\]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, let's first determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

Next, we sum the total howl duration of all three wolves:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds} \):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the average age of the group as \(A_{avg}\). The total age of the group is 20, so the average age is:
\[ A_{avg} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we have:
\[ H = 2 \times A_{avg} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by using the total age of the group:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 \]
\[ 17 + W = 20 \]
\[ W = 20 - 17 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice in relation to the others.

Let's assume the watermelon is divided into \( n \) slices. Since the family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide the watermelon, we have \( n \) slices to be divided among 6 people.

Given that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all slices. Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is \( 4x \). There are 2 adults, so the total size of the slices for the adults is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

Thus, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) slices, and there are 2 adults, so the total size of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total size of adult slices}}{\text{Total size of watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on the clinic rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he will spend on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time he will have left to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest time she can start making the cake, we subtract the total time required from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold three and a half boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold four and a half boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost of renting the studio per session: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we need to determine the number of sessions in a month. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. For simplicity, let's assume a month has 4 weeks.

- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total number of sessions in a month: 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total number of sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: $40 * 12 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:

1. \( 4p = 64 \)
2. \( 7m = 56 \)

To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the first equation by 4:

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the second equation by 7:

\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now we know that Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box and Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box. To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

8"
"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to determine the number of female porcupines and then calculate the number of babies born over the course of a year.

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Therefore, the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

2. **Calculate the number of babies born in a year:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, each female porcupine will give birth to \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) babies in a year.
   - With 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year is \( 30 \times 48 = 1440 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of porcupines after a year:**
   - The initial number of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of babies born in a year is 1440.
   - Therefore, the total number of porcupines after a year is \( 50 + 1440 = 1490 \).

The final numerical answer is 1490."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet, then convert that volume to gallons, and finally calculate the cost based on the given rate.

The volume of the pool can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: length × width × depth.

Given dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are 7.48052 gallons in a cubic foot.

Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 7.48052 gallons/cubic foot = 10,472.728 gallons.

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = 10,472.728 gallons × $0.10/gallon = $1,047.27.

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1,047.27."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color and then sum them up.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks.

Next, we calculate the number of blue sticks. According to the problem, there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the number of yellow sticks. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we sum up the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[ 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is:

"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Matteo}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Shandy}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda, so Ms. B's contribution on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Wanda's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Ms. B's contribution on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled in Two Days:**
   - Total water filled = 7875 (first day) + 4125 (second day) = 12000 gallons.

4. **Remaining Water to Fill the Tank:**
   - Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Remaining water = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.658 \times 0.817 = 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x \times 0.534 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \]
\[ x \approx 0.525 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.5%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save.

The cost of the car is $10000. She wants to save 20% of this amount for the downpayment:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, and she works 40 hours a week:
\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = 25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2000}{\$1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

Remaining amount = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each, so the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:

Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

She gave these 13 packs to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, each friend received:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Let's calculate the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. 

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. This means each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies and portraits can be calculated as follows:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

- Number of portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the two quantities together:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded is:

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is given as $4. Since large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 12L + 4S = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 12L + 4(2L) = 120 \]
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \)."

"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since there were 100 eggs hidden in total, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - One dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Add this to the original amount: \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the daily ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - 40 dwarves will mine \( 40 \times 18 = 720 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Multiply the daily capacity by the number of days: \( 720 \times 30 = 21600 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost of the sandwiches is directly proportional to the number of sandwiches in the package.

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches. We know that the cost per sandwich is $1.5, so for 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total cost Tom has to pay for the new bedroom set after selling his old one. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the cost of the new bedroom set after selling the old one is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this amount per month. 

To find 10% of $2000, we calculate:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[
\text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10
\]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[
\text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6
\]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[
\text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6
\]

Now, we sum up all the remaining balloons:

- Red balloons remaining: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons remaining: 6
- Blue balloons added: 6

Total number of balloons carried into the school:

\[
15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios and their outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.5
   - Therefore, the probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 50% or 0.5

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Therefore, the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6

3. **Personal Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.2
   - Therefore, the probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.5
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework: 40% or 0.4
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 60% or 0.6

To find the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where he has to turn in his homework:

\[ \text{Total probability} = (0.5 \times 0.5) + (0.5 \times 0.6) \]

\[ \text{Total probability} = 0.25 + 0.30 \]

\[ \text{Total probability} = 0.55 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 55%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This includes the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats available = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total tickets to be distributed = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty
Total tickets to be distributed = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, we need to split these 1250 tickets equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are \( G \) graduates. The number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Total tickets to be distributed}}{G} = \frac{1250}{G} \]

However, the question does not specify the number of graduates. If we assume the number of graduates is known or can be determined, we can calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate would receive. Without the specific number of graduates, we can't provide a numerical answer. 

If we were to assume a specific number of graduates, for example, if there are 1000 graduates, then:

\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{1250}{1000} = 1.25 \]

So, if there are 1000 graduates, each graduate would receive 1.25 tickets. But since the number of graduates is not specified, the final numerical answer cannot be provided without that information."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books at $16 each:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \]

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next one, he will need to make 7 trips (from the first to the second, from the second to the third, and so on, until the seventh trip to the eighth bottle).

Each trip takes 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time for all the trips is:

\[
7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds per trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[

"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we first need to calculate the total number of apples he has.

There are forty apples in one box, and he ordered two boxes. So, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of eight apples each can be made from the total of 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she buys and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.

\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.

\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18
\]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese:

\[
\text{Total cost of cheese} = \$22 + \$18 = \$40
\]

Amor started with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

\[
\text{Money left} = \$50 - \$40 = \$10
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During his college years, Jim would have earned $0 because he was in school.
- Therefore, the income lost from not working while in school is $0.

Finally, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college and subtract the total amount borrowed:
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $100,000.
- Total amount borrowed = $200,000.
- Income deficit = $200,000 - $100,000 = $100,000.

To find out how long it would take for Jim to earn the $100,000, we need to consider his post-college income:
- After college, Jim's income triples, so his new income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

Now, we calculate how many years it would take for Jim to earn $100,000 at his new income:
- Years to earn $100,000 = $100,000 / $75,000 = 1.3333 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 1.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total number of square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. Monday's delivery was 425 letters.

One-fifth of Monday's delivery is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

Adding 17 to this amount gives us Tuesday's delivery:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery. Since Tuesday's delivery was 102 letters, twice this amount is:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

Adding 5 to this amount gives us Wednesday's delivery:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ 736 \]"

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Therefore, the average amount Johnny's dad lost per race is approximately $7.17."
"To find the total population in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

The total population can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Population} = \text{Number of Countries} \times \text{Number of Cities per Country} \times \text{Number of People per City} \]
\[ \text{Total Population} = 26 \times 5 \times 1000 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 26 \times 5 = 130 \]
\[ 130 \times 1000 = 130000 \]

Therefore, the total population in South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, let's convert the fraction of a day into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days the painters worked over the 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the total hours of work for the team over these 21 days:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters working together, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need to combine the terms involving \( x \). To do this, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
5x = 30
\]
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = \$20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), would be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), would be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^2 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), would be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, we calculate \( P_3 \):
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

First, calculate \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.491099 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.491099 \approx 9821.98 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately \( \$9821.98 \)."
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 German books.

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego, California and New York City, New York.

The total distance is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has driven 325 kilometers.

So, the remaining distance is calculated as follows:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1 ft by 1 ft, the number of tiles needed will be equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet.

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Each tile covers 1 SqFt, so we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\$2400"
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60% due to the accident, we calculate the increased amount as follows:

\[ \text{Increased cost} = \text{Normal cost} \times \text{Percentage increase} \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times 0.60 \]
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 72 \]

Now, we add this increased cost to the normal cost to get the total monthly cost:

\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Normal cost} + \text{Increased cost} \]
\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 120 + 72 \]
\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 192 \]

Finally, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = \text{Total monthly cost} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = 192 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load.

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
- Total loads = 2 (for twin beds) + 1 (for king size bed) = 3 loads.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads Greg does in a year is:
- Total loads in a year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

The final numerical answer is:
156"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply that by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

In 4 weeks, they watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so his collection increased to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means he collected 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Therefore, his collection increased to 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The final numerical answer is 250."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed by all the cats in one day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]
So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes, which is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by the number of days in a work week.

First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day. Since 20% of the emails do not require a response, 80% of the emails do require a response. James gets 80 emails a day, so the number of emails that require a response each day is:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday, which is \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

\[
192 + 30 = 222

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we first need to calculate the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out and then the cost for each type.

1. **Number of small coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons.

2. **Number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

3. **Cost to mail small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. The total cost for mailing 700 small coupons is:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Cost to mail big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. The total cost for mailing 1400 big coupons is:
   \[
   1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}

5. **Total cost of mailing all coupons:**
   Adding the costs for the small and big coupons gives:
   \[
   3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Convert total cost to dollars:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:
   \[
   \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney was left with:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches she had after the new order was:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

First, we calculate the total number of trucks dispatched:
- Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.

Next, we determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:
- A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.
- Therefore, the number of trucks with mechanical failures is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) trucks.

This means the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
- \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) trucks.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
- \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) tons.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Let's break down the purchase of 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:
- Dennis can buy 2 pounds of butter and get 1 pound of butter for half price.
- He can repeat this process twice to get 6 pounds of butter.

For each cycle of 2 pounds:
- Dennis pays full price for 1 pound: \( \$4.00 \).
- Dennis gets 1 pound for half price: \( \$4.00 / 2 = \$2.00 \).

So, for each cycle of 2 pounds, Dennis pays:
\[ \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need 3 cycles (each cycle providing 2 pounds):
\[ 3 \times \$6.00 = \$18.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Total guests who will attend = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Now, we calculate the cost based on the given pricing structure:

- The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests.
- The additional fee is $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20.

First, we calculate the additional fee for the 21st to 41st guests:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Additional fee = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we add the base rental fee to the additional fee:

- Total cost = $125 (base rental fee) + $126 (additional fee) = $251.

Therefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie had $60 and spent a quarter of her money. So, the amount Maggie spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Therefore, the amount Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza also had $60 and spent one-third of her money. So, the amount Riza spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Therefore, the amount Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and Jenny bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 times a dozen). However, since the florist only sells roses by the dozen, we need to consider the cost of 1.25 dozen roses. The cost for 1.25 dozen roses is:

\[ 1.25 \times \$15 = \$18.75 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the dozen roses from the total cost to find out how much more Jenny needs to pay for the remaining 0.25 dozen roses. Since 0.25 dozen is equivalent to 3 roses, and each rose costs $2, the cost for 3 roses is:

\[ 3 \times \$2 = \$6 \]

So, the total additional cost for the remaining roses is:

\[ \$30 - \$18.75 = \$11.25 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

After paying for the dozen roses, she has:

\[ \$25 - \$18.75 = \$6.25 \]

To cover the additional \$11.25, she needs to pay the remaining \$5.25. Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to determine how many quarters make up \$5.25. Each quarter is worth \$0.25, so the number of quarters is:

\[ \frac{\$5.25}{\$0.25} = 21 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 21 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. Earnings from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Earnings from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Earnings from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total earnings:

Total earnings = Earnings from milkshakes + Earnings from burger platters + Earnings from sodas
Total earnings = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00
Total earnings = $162.00

So, the total money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - This is the train Paul needs to board.

Now, we need to determine how long Paul will wait for his train. He will board the fourth train at 85 minutes, and since the fourth train arrives at 85 minutes, Paul will wait 0 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 0 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

**Step 2: Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch was $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
\]

The discount percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[
\boxed{10\%}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working simultaneously over a period of 4 hours.

First, let's understand the rate at which each spring creates jellyfish. Since each spring creates one jellyfish every second, we need to find out how many jellyfish one spring can create in 4 hours.

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are:
\[ 60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds in an hour} \]
Therefore, in 4 hours, there are:
\[ 4 \times 3600 = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]
Since each spring creates one jellyfish every second, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.

Now, if we have 5 springs working simultaneously, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours will be:
\[ 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72000 \]"
"To find Frankie's score, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so \( B = 90 \).

Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score, which can be written as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time James spent walking.

First, let's determine the total distance James walked. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, which is another 2 miles. So, the total distance he walked is 2 + 2 = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The time taken to walk a certain distance is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

The total amount of fence between them is 100 feet, so we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

"To find out how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold * Price of one MTB = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold * Price of one BMX = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold * Price of one Trekking bike = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

Thus, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour day, the farmer will make:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Over a 6-hour day, the truck will pick up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

The total number of bales made minus the total number of bales picked up will give us the number of bales left in the field:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the time John spends in class each week and then add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has each day:
- A normal student has 6 periods.
- John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time John spends in class each day is:
\[ 8 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total time he spends in class each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the total extra learning time he spends on these days is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, let's add the time spent in class and the extra learning time to find the total time John spends learning each week:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. The third-floor balcony is 3 stories high, and each story is 24 feet:

\[ \text{Height of third-floor balcony} = 3 \times 24 \text{ feet} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \text{Height on first bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[ \text{Height on second bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is:

6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. 

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors ate was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

According to the problem, the Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that the remaining meat after the velociraptors was exactly 270 kilograms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms. 

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To calculate the total cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then determine how many people he helps.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days:
- 80% of 50 days = 0.80 * 50 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help:
- 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps in the 40 days he works:
- 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 240 people."
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars, and then sum these two numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \( 12 \times 35 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \( 20 \times 3 \).

Finally, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to get the total number of people inside the church.

Let's do the calculations:
- Number of people in the buses: \( 12 \times 35 = 420 \)
- Number of people in the cars: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. Therefore, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of the frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Total cost of the frying pan and the set of towels: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
6. New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color under UV light is 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and the percentage of her salary she plans to live on in retirement.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = $20,000 \).

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement:
- Her retirement salary will be 40% of her current salary.
- Therefore, her retirement salary will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = $40,000 \).

Now, we need to calculate how many years it will take for her to save enough for her retirement. We know she plans to save for 20 years in retirement, and she needs to save $40,000 each year for her retirement.

Let's denote the number of years Lauren needs to work as \( y \).

The total amount she needs to save for her retirement is:
\[ 40,000 \times 20 = $800,000 \]

Since she saves $20,000 each year, the number of years \( y \) she needs to work to save $800,000 is:
\[ y = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Given that 40% of the total students is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned miles per day and the miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey on time.

First, we know that Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

Next, we calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day:
\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we know that Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ \text{Miles per day planned} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we subtract the planned miles per day from the miles per day she needs to hike:
\[ \text{Additional miles per day needed} = 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how much each person wants in terms of kilograms of apples.

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Peter wants a quarter of that, so:
\[ \text{Peter's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of that, so:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's add up the amounts that Peter and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Peter and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount left for James is:

1. Determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases.
2. Calculate the total amount spent on the books.
3. Divide the total amount spent on the books by the number of books bought.

First, Anna started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna has already spent $4 on other items, so the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Therefore, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

To find the rate of blinking, we divide the number of blinks by the time in minutes:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

Let's calculate the time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is 9 minutes."
"To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fishes after Tate buys more.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fishes, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia's chore was mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's chore. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's chore. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume Dior's chore took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption given the ""well over"" phrase).

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{22}

"To determine the total miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time in hours:**
   John takes 2 hours to drive one way.

2. **Calculate the round trip driving time in hours:**
   Since the round trip involves driving to his parents and back, the total time for the round trip is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (one way)} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours (round trip)}
   \]

3. **Determine the speed of the car:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

4. **Calculate the total distance driven in the round trip:**
   Distance is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 280 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, John drives a total of 280 miles each month when visiting his parents."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk a total of \(10 \times 7 = 70\) miles.

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. So, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is:
\[12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

However, we calculated that the first 4 workers produced only 200 toys in 10 hours. This discrepancy indicates that the fifth worker must have produced the difference:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

Since the fifth worker works for the entire 10-hour shift, the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[180 \text{ toys} \div 10 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight of both dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them, so the remaining stickers Kris received and gave to Rob were \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 \).
4. Kris gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob, so \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \).

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[
\frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
S = 64
\]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. 

\[
\boxed{64}

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms/bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 50 days."
"To find the speed of the faster car, we first need to determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given:
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
- The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
- The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

First, calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of average car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, calculate the speed of the faster car:
\[ \text{Speed of faster car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the faster car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first determine Liam's age two years ago. Since Liam is currently 16 years old, two years ago he was:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) (since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is \( S + (S + 12) = 2S + 12 \).

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of the boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of the crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of the crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write the equation for her speed on the beach as:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by the weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, I'll add up the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, I'll add these numbers together:

\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation gives:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the remaining amount of water in the 33-degree mug is \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees.

He also pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. This means the remaining amount of water in the second mug is \( T - 1 \) degrees.

Since the water in the water bottle is now drinkable (at least 40 degrees), the temperature of the water in the water bottle after the transfer must be at least 40 degrees. The temperature of the water in the water bottle is the sum of the temperatures of the water poured from both mugs. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 29 + (T - 1) \geq 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:

\[ 29 + T - 1 \geq 40 \]
\[ 28 + T \geq 40 \]

Subtracting 28 from both sides:

\[ T \geq 12 \]

So, the second mug of water must be at least 12 degrees to allow Donny to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, I'll calculate the total number of animals added to the farm over the course of three weeks and then add that to the initial number of animals.

First, let's calculate the number of animals added by Milkie Cows Limited:
- They bring 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(20 \times 7 = 140\) cows.
- For three weeks, they bring \(140 \times 3 = 420\) cows.

Next, let's calculate the number of animals added by Broilers Limited:
- They bring 10 chickens per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, they bring \(10 \times 7 = 70\) chickens.
- For three weeks, they bring \(70 \times 3 = 210\) chickens.

Now, let's add the initial number of animals to the total number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
- Total cows: 470
- Total chickens: 230
- Total animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 700."
"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is the total cost after the discount divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

So, the number of scoops Gomer ate is:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

1 less than 3 scoops is:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

3 less than 6 potatoes is:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio of potatoes to scoops:

If 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, then 18 scoops would require:
\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects from all his trees over a period of 10 years.

First, we know that Tim grows 5 trees and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. So, the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year is 6. 

Therefore, the number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade (10 years). We multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by 10:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to first determine how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply that by 3.

From the information given:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8 \text{ per bouquet}} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers per bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers were sold in 3 days:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 252 \text{ sunflowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, Adam loses $56."
"To determine the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
  \]

Now, we sum up the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:
\[
\boxed{22}

"To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, I'll follow these steps:

1. Determine the daily cost of food for all the fish.
2. Calculate the number of days in May.
3. Multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May.

Step 1: Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. Therefore, the total daily cost of food for all the fish is:
\[ 3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day} \]

Step 2: May has 31 days.

Step 3: To find the total cost for the month of May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May:
\[ \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93 \]

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food in the month of May."
"Patricia originally had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100: \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(12\%\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. Therefore, we can find out how many seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from the number of seashells Jim collected:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{59}{3} = 19 \frac{2}{3} \]

So, each person got \( 19 \frac{2}{3} \) seashells. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 19 \frac{2}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + (0.60 \times 5) \]

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the duration of the first song and the second song to find the total duration of the cassette:

\[ \text{Total duration} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Calculate the total cost of the mobile devices he bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: The selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price, which is $20 * 2 = $40.

Step 2: Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so he bought a total of 2 + 4 = 6 devices. The total cost is 6 * $20 = $120.

Step 3: The total revenue from selling all 6 devices at $40 each is 6 * $40 = $240.

Step 4: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $120."

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed. Each bottle can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know that Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to two decimal places for simplicity, we can consider it as 1 baby, as we can't have a fraction of a baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
- Total babies wearing bows: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the final numerical answer is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of land sold:**
   - Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
   - He sold half of the land: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After a month, he sold another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his land: \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.
   - The remaining land is: \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \) square meters.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from the sales:**
   - Revenue from the first sale: \( 40 \) square meters at $50 per square meter: \( 40 \times 50 = 2000 \) dollars.
   - Revenue from the second sale: \( 20 \) square meters at $30 per square meter: \( 20 \times 30 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Revenue from the remaining land: \( 20 \) square meters at $3 per square meter: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Sum up the total revenue:**

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs that Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
  \[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
  \[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( R \) into the third equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is:

"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa was given as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Ronnie was given $5, so the total amount of money Rissa had initially was $15 and Ronnie had $5.

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars each, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Now, we know that each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms and the living room, and then add the area of the rest of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms and the living room to find the total area of the bedrooms and the living room:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms and living room} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} = 2160 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cycles you can run with $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, we can calculate the number of cycles you can run with $1 by dividing the number of pods by the cost per pod:
\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ cycles per dollar} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

"First, let's determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially had 50 $20 bills.

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. The number of $20 bills remaining is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill. The number of $20 bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of $20 bills left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Now, we need to convert the remaining $20 bills into dollars. The total amount of money left is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Thomas then triples his money. The new total amount of money is:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money into $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals Scored:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, and he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can calculate the amount of chalk used as follows:

\[ \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 5 \times \frac{45}{100} = 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

So, the amount of chalk left after Monday is:

\[ \text{Chalk left after Monday} = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Now, the teacher will use only 20% of the chalk each day. We need to find out how many days he can continue using the chalk before it reaches 2 inches, which is the threshold for recycling.

Let's denote the number of days he can continue using the chalk as \( d \). Each day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk, so the amount of chalk left after \( d \) days can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Chalk left after } d \text{ days} = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20)^d = 2.75 \times (0.80)^d \]

We need to find the smallest \( d \) such that the chalk left is less than 2 inches:

\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^d < 2 \]

To solve for \( d \), we can divide both sides by 2.75:

\[ (0.80)^d < \frac{2}{2.75} \]

\[ (0.80)^d < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273 \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( d \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by trial and error or by using logarithms. Let's try some values of \( d \):

For \( d = 3 \):

\[ (0.80)^3 = 0.512 \]

Since 0.512 is greater than 0.7273, \( d = 3 \) is not sufficient. Now let's try \( d = 4 \):

\[ (0.80)^4 = 0.4096 \]

Since 0.4096 is less than 0.7273, \( d = 4 \) is sufficient. Therefore, the teacher can continue using the chalk for 4 days before he has to recycle it.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity.

Given:
- Total number of boys = 12
- Total number of girls = 12
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

First, calculate the number of girls on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, calculate the number of boys on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, calculate the total number of students on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (boys)} = 7 \]

Finally, calculate the number of students not on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. Then we calculate how many face masks Johnny bought, which is 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Mike bought 5 face masks.
2. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   3 \times \text{Mike's face masks} + 2
   \]
3. Substituting the number of face masks Mike bought:
   \[
   3 \times 5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17
   \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is 17."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

James has 30 teeth in total.

The dentist drills 4 teeth.
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

50%"
"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk sold to Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk sold:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon} = 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much milk was returned. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he purchased:
\[
\text{Milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the cost of the milk is $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount is:
\[
\text{Refund amount} = \text{Milk returned} \times \text{Cost per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations.

For Wendy's current age:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

For the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. 

To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ books}}{500 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{x \text{ books}}{27000 \text{ dollars}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \times 27000}{500} \]

\[ x = \frac{2700000}{500} \]

\[ x = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, Bob has $27,000 to distribute among 3 schools. To find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} \]

\[ \text{Books per school} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events and calculate the number of apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head, so he now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the two apples that had fallen, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
4. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
5. He picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
6. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.

In total, Newton has 1 + 6 = 7 apples. He put all but one of these in his pocket, so he brought home 7 - 1 = 6 apples.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[ 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the cheese pizza = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the pepperoni pizza = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Next, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take for him to have 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs. To express this as a fraction, it is exactly \( \frac{10}{3} \) hours.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, we can work backwards to find Jim's age at that time.

If John was 28 then, Jim would have been half that age, which is 14.

Since 20 years have passed since the show came out, we add 20 years to Jim's age at that time to find his current age.

So, Jim's current age is 14 + 20 = 34.

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which means her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add up the slices each person ate: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38, they had 12 bandages left (50 - 38 = 12).
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had 12 bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - They had 12 bandages left from the first day.
   - So, they had 12 + 12 = 24 bandages at the start of the second day.
   - After using 28, they had 24 - 28 = -4 bandages, which means they were short by 4 bandages and needed to order more.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had 50 - 4 = 46 bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used half a bulk pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - They had 46 bandages left from the end of the second day.
   - So, they had 46 + 100 - 25 = 121 bandages at the start of the third day.
   - At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.
   - So, they used 121 - 78 = 43 bandages on the third day.

Now, let's sum up the bandages used and ordered over the three days to find out how many they started with on the first day:

- First day: 38 bandages used.
- Second day: 28 bandages used.
- Third day: 43 bandages used.
- Total bandages used: 38 + 28 + 43 = 109 bandages.
- They ordered 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 bulk packs over the three days.
- Total bandages ordered: 4 * 50 = 200 bandages.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

So, the total number of bandages they started with on the first day is the total bandages ordered minus the bandages used:

200 - 109 = 91 bandages.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 91."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was initially 10 inches long and ended at 8 inches. So, the length of hair cut is:

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for a single day:
\[ \text{Regular pay per day} = 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate her regular pay for a single week:
\[ \text{Regular pay per week} = \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her regular pay for April is:
\[ \text{Regular pay for April} = \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an attendance bonus of $10 for each week she has complete attendance. Since she had complete attendance for all 4 weeks in April, her total attendance bonus is:
\[ \text{Attendance bonus for April} = \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Therefore, her total earnings for April are the sum of her regular pay and her attendance bonus:
\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to sum up the earnings from each task he completed.

1. For doing laundry: $3.00
2. For cleaning his room: $1.50
3. For taking the trash out: $0.75 per trip, and he took the trash out twice, so $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
4. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

So, Jason earned $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered the restaurant.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered the restaurant.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice the 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

   - Therefore, the number of fish with blue stripes is \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

5. **Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - We already know there are 22 fish with red stripes.
   - There are 20 fish with blue stripes.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes is \( 22 + 20 = 42 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. So, Amy loses four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up three colors. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

"First, let's calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Now, we can determine how many shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells:

The average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles per day. Since Bernie has 4 dogs, the total miles walked by all four dogs in one day is:
4 * 3 = 12 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
12 - 8 = 4 miles.

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles."
"First, let's calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

The cost price of the magazines is $72. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. Therefore, we calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day at each setting and then multiply by the number of days the dehumidifier was used at each setting.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Water removed per day: 1 liter
   - Number of days: 3
   - Total water removed at low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\)

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Water removed per day: \(2 \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 2 \text{ liters/day}\)

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it has increased by 150%. A 150% increase means the cost is multiplied by 2.5 (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original cost).

So, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is:
\[ 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of visits for the first 5 years. Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, the total number of visits in 5 years is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ visits} \]
The total cost for these 15 visits is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases to $5, and Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years. The total number of visits in these 3 years is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]
The total cost for these 9 visits is:
\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years to find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum:
\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply that by the time each group spends in the escape room.

First, we find the total number of students in the school:
- There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6).
- The 7th grade has 10 students as well.

So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ (grade 4)} + 10 \text{ (grade 5)} + 10 \text{ (grade 6)} + 10 \text{ (grade 7)} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students per group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group spends 45 minutes in the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes per group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ 225 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]
(There are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is 10.)

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify this by calculating the number of brownies:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:

3. Add the cost of nail art on each of her fingers.

First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and the basic pedicure:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we calculate the total cost of both services without the discount:
- Total cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Now, we apply the 20% discount:
- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art costs $3:
- Cost of nail art: 10 fingers * $3 per finger = $30

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the total cost after the discount:
- Total cost including nail art: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ K = 27 + 4 \]

\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this result is not realistic because it exceeds 100%. This indicates that the custodian is working more than one full day in the 5 days available. Let's recheck the calculation to ensure accuracy.

The total time required is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours. The percentage of the day spent cleaning is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

This result is indeed correct, but it implies the custodian is working more than one full day in the 5 days available. Given the constraints, the custodian would need to work more than 5 days to complete the cleaning. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 250\% \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf.

1. Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we can calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:
- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Adding these together, the total capacity of one bookcase is:
\[20 + 20 + 15 = 55\] books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[110 \div 55 = 2\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell. Since she sells 3 eggs for $1, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

Number of sets = 60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Finally, let's calculate her total revenue from selling the eggs. Since she sells each set of 3 eggs for $1:

Total revenue = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

To find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Skyler has a total of 100 hats.

1. Half of the hats are red:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

2. After removing the red hats, we have:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats remaining}
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

4. After removing the blue hats, we have:
   \[
   50 - 30 = 20 \text{ hats remaining}
   \]

The remaining hats are white. Therefore, the number of white hats is:
\[
20
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since each bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey got 60% of them correct. We can calculate the number of correct answers on the first test as follows:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in the four years is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3360 \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he actually had 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:
200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of people**: There are 4 people in the house, including Brianna.
2. **Number of flashlights**: There are 4 flashlights for the 4 people, and additionally, 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is:
   \[
   4 \text{ (for people)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (for rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights}
   \]
3. **Number of rooms**: There are 8 rooms in the house.
4. **Number of small candles**: Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each:
   \[
   4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ small candles}
   \]
5. **Number of medium candles**: The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each:
   \[
   4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ medium candles}
   \]
6. **Total number of candles and flashlights**: Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together:
   \[
   20 \text{ flashlights} + 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 56

If Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, then there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's convert Tim's daily work hours into minutes to make the calculation easier. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls Tim can handle in a day. Given that it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by the number of days in the week:

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

For the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish:

"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants:
\[ 20 \text{ plants} - 12 \text{ plants} = 8 \text{ plants} \]

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the groups of plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel half the distance on land and the other half in water.

First, let's determine the distance he needs to travel on land and in water:
- Total distance = 200 yards
- Half of the distance on land = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
- Half of the distance in water = 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each segment of the journey:
- Time to hop 100 yards on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes
- Time to swim 100 yards in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the times for both segments to find the total time:
- Total time = 5 minutes (on land) + 10 minutes (in water) = 15 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."

"Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs \( 2x \).

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone, there are four additional phones. Therefore, the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones, we get:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, I'll first calculate John's new speaking speed after training, then determine the total number of words in 10 pages, and finally calculate the time it would take him to speak those words at his new speed.

1. John's new speaking speed is 2.5 times his starting speed:
   \[
   150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
   \]

2. Each page has 450 words, so 10 pages have:
   \[
   10 \times 450 = 4500 \, \text{words}
   \]

3. To find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by his speaking speed:
   \[

   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the number of people Conor saw on the first day:
\[ \text{First day} = 50 \]

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day:
\[ \text{Second day} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day:
\[ \text{Third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day over the week was 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is:
\[ 5 \times 60 = 300 \]

The total number of people seen over the week can also be expressed as the sum of the people seen on each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 300 \]
\[ 260 + 3x = 300 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 300 - 260 \]
\[ 3x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \]

However, since the number of people must be a whole number, we can conclude that the value of \( x \) is indeed 13.33, but for the purpose of calculating the total number of people seen, we use the sum:
\[ 260 + 3 \times 13.33 = 260 + 40 = 300 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the initial rate, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves the previous rate, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat. The number of kernels that pop due to residual heat is:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 210 \]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we will first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required and then figure out how many lemons are needed for the extra tart lemonade.

1. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - For each gallon, he needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \( 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Tim needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - For this extra gallon, he needs \( 1 \text{ cup} \) of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed for all lemonade:**
   - Total lemon juice needed = \( 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed for the regular lemonade:**
   - For 4 gallons of regular lemonade, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 4 cups, he needs \( 4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons} \).

5. **Determine the number of lemons needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - For 1 cup of lemon juice, he needs 6 lemons.

6. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed:**
   - Total lemons needed = lemons for regular lemonade + lemons for extra tart lemonade
   - Total lemons needed = \( 24 \text{ lemons} + 6 \text{ lemons} = 30 \text{ lemons} \).

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to find out how much food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume per day, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day \(\times\) 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."

\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the equation to find the number of red blocks:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

Pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
Pink candies = 232 - 189
Pink candies = 43

The final numerical answer is 43."
"To calculate the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel stay is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus travels:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- The cost of one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel stay and the total cost of the bus travels to find the total amount Helen paid:
- Total cost = Cost of hotel stay + Cost of bus travels
- Total cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Dallas originally had 21 marbles, and he dropped 4 of them:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

So, Dallas has 17 marbles after the drop.

Since Mazie initially had 52 marbles and Dallas ended up with 17 marbles after receiving some from Mazie, we can find out how many marbles Dallas received from Mazie by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas originally had from the number he had after the drop:

\[ 17 - 21 = -4 \]

This calculation shows that Dallas actually gave away 4 marbles, not received them. Therefore, the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie is:

\[ 21 - 17 = 4 \]

Since the total number of marbles Mazie had initially is 52, and Dallas received 4 marbles, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \]

Thus, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"

"To calculate the total cost of the place settings, we need to consider the cost of each piece of the 3-piece set (dinner plate, salad plate, and bowl) and then multiply by the number of sets Avery needs.

The cost of one dinner plate is $6.00.
The cost of one salad plate is $4.00.
The cost of one bowl is $5.00.

So, the cost of one 3-piece place setting is:
\[ 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, so she needs 12 sets of place settings. Therefore, the total cost will be:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total amount of feed each pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, each pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, calculate the total amount of feed all five pigs eat in a day:
- Since there are five pigs, the total feed consumption per day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, calculate the total amount of feed all five pigs eat in a week:
- There are 7 days in a week, so the total feed consumption in a week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
- The amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs left over} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of additional hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend:

"First, let's calculate the total money Frances earns from selling the cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so the total from cupcakes is:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so the total from cookies is:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

Adding these together, the total money Frances earns is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies. Each tray costs $4, so the total cost for the trays is:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals she was supposed to distribute:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the time spent each day and then multiply by the number of days in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation in the morning: 15 minutes
- Meditation before sleep: 15 minutes
- Total meditation time per day: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each day:
- Yoga practice: 1 hour (60 minutes)

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga each day:
- Total daily practice time: 30 minutes (meditation) + 60 minutes (yoga) = 90 minutes

Since Charisma practices 5 days a week, we calculate the weekly practice time:
- Weekly practice time: 90 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 450 minutes/week

Finally, we calculate the total practice time over 4 weeks:
- Total practice time over 4 weeks: 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Total practice time over 4 weeks in hours: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

First, let's find out how many bars are produced in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, in 14 days, they will produce \(5000 \times 14 = 70000\) bars.

Next, we calculate the total revenue. The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is \(70000 \times 2 = 140000\).

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts and the original prices of the items he bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

1. The first T-shirt costs $8.
2. The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.

The total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off.

1. The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16.
2. The discounted price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 5400 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's calculate the total number of items Igor actually placed on the lab bench:

- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Adding these up: \( 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \).

However, the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. This means that the difference between the total number of items he should have placed and the actual number he placed is the number of beakers he lost.

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is \( 31 - 29 = 2 \).

The final numerical answer is 2."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Tables**: James is putting together 4 tables.
2. **Legs per Table**: Each table has 4 legs.
3. **Total Legs**: Therefore, the total number of legs for 4 tables is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) legs.
4. **Screws per Leg**: Each leg needs 2 screws.
5. **Total Screws Needed**: Therefore, the total number of screws needed for 16 legs is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) screws.
6. **Screws Available**: James has 40 screws.
7. **Screws Left Over**: The number of screws left over after assembly is \(40 - 32 = 8\) screws.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs. 

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs. 

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each girl raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300. So:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we can sum up the total amount raised by all the girls:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Let's add these amounts:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by all the girls is:
\[ 2180 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means if Vanessa's speed is \( v \) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We are also given that Vanessa ran 4 miles. Since Aaron's speed is \( 2v \), we can calculate the time it took Aaron to run his part of the race. Aaron's time to run 4 miles is given as 16 minutes. Using the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, we can write:

\[ \text{Aaron's time} = \frac{\text{Distance Aaron ran}}{\text{Aaron's speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2v \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{4}{2v} = \frac{2}{v} \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Aaron's time is 16 minutes, so:

\[ \frac{2}{v} = 16 \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we know Vanessa's speed is \( v = \frac{1}{8} \) miles per minute. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can calculate the time it took her to run 4 miles using the formula for time again:

\[ \text{Vanessa's time} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Vanessa's speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The dock is 200 feet long.
- He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.

Therefore, the total line required for the dock is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the line he already has from the total line required:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Thus, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"To calculate the total earnings for Tom's restaurant in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's determine the number of reservations per night:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.

Next, we calculate the total number of reservations per day:
- Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total number of reservations per day is \(6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/day} = 12 \text{ reservations/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total earnings per night:
- Each reservation includes 2 meals costing $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
- The cost of meals per reservation is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- Adding the cost of the bottle of wine, the total cost per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total earnings per night are \(12 \text{ reservations/night} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 180\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total earnings for the week:
- Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total earnings for the week are \(180 \text{ dollars/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 360\) dollars.

Thus, the total earnings for the week are:
\[
\boxed{360}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we need to calculate 125% of the cost per watermelon (100% for the original cost plus 25% profit):

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00. 

\[
\boxed{2.00}
\]"
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. Therefore, James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.
4. James is 18 years old, and he is 3 years younger than John (since John was 19 when James was born).
5. This means John is currently 18 + 3 = 21 years old.
6. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 32 - 21 = 11 years old.
7. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 11 + 3 = 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $400 (since 100% - 80% = 20%):
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the discounted price of the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the cost for the mechanic's labor is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 320 + 150 = 470 \]

Thus, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 470 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's solve the first equation for \( K \):
\[ K = 20 - C \]

Next, substitute \( K \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]
\[ 2C + 80 - 4C = 70 \]
\[ -2C + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2C = 70 - 80 \]
\[ -2C = -10 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens. To find the number of cows, we substitute \( C = 5 \) back into the equation \( K = 20 - C \):
\[ K = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows. To verify, we can check the total number of legs:
\[ 2 \times 5 + 4 \times 15 = 10 + 60 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. The number of chickens is 5.

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
