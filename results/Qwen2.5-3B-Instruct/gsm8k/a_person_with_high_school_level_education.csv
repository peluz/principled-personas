"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.
4. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

To find out how many eggs are left for sale, we subtract the eggs used for breakfast and the eggs used for muffins from the total eggs laid:

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs eaten for breakfast} - \text{Eggs used for muffins} \]

\[ \text{Eggs left for sale} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Now, Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. To find out how much she makes in total, we multiply the number of eggs left for sale by the price per egg:

\[ \text{Total money made} = \text{Eggs left for sale} \times \text{Price per egg} \]

\[ \text{Total money made} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
   - It takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) bolts.

2. **Calculate the amount of white fiber:**
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) bolt.

3. **Calculate the total amount of fiber needed:**
   - The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.
   - Total bolts = bolts of blue fiber + bolts of white fiber.
   - Total bolts = 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.

So, the total number of bolts needed is 3.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the increase in value.

Josh initially bought the house for $80,000 and then added $50,000 in repairs. So, the total cost before the increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The problem states that the repairs and the subsequent increase in value increased the house's value by 150%. To find the new value, we need to calculate 150% of the total cost and add it to the total cost.

150% of $130,000 is:
\[ 150\% \times 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one week of sprints:**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs. So, in one week, he runs:
   \[
   3 \text{ sprints/week} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   James runs a total of 180 meters in a week.

So, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

She gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since she has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the whole flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of each type of glass:**
   - The first glass costs $5.
   - Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

2. **Determine the pattern:**
   - The first glass costs $5.
   - The second glass costs $3.
   - The third glass costs $5.
   - The fourth glass costs $3.
   - And so on...

3. **Calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:**
   - We can see that the cost alternates between $5 and $3.
   - In a set of 16 glasses, there will be 8 glasses at $5 and 8 glasses at $3.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 8 glasses at $5:**
   \[
   8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 8 glasses at $3:**
   \[
   8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Add the costs together to get the total cost for 16 glasses:**
   \[
   40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sheep each city has based on the information given.

1. We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse together:
\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"First, let's calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded before the restart. The file is 200 GB in total, and she has downloaded 40% of it before the restart.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 200 \text{ GB} = 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

So, she has 80 GB downloaded before the restart. This means she has \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\) left to download.

Now, Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute. To find out how long it takes to download the remaining 120 GB at this speed:

\[ \text{Time to download 120 GB} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

The restart took 20 minutes, so the total time to download the file is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes (restart)} + 60 \text{ minutes (download)} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total load to download the file is 80 minutes."
"First, let's break down the journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time for the fourth segment = 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, let's sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance John has traveled.

Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Since John started 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

Distance from home = Total distance traveled - Distance from home initially = 315 miles - 180 miles = 135 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 135 miles."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break it down into two parts: her earnings for the first 40 hours and her earnings for the additional hours (which are considered overtime).

1. **Regular Hours Earnings:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - So, her earnings for the first 40 hours are:
     \[
     40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400
     \]

2. **Overtime Hours Earnings:**
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (since she worked 45 hours total).
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Her overtime rate is:
     \[
     1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour}
     \]
   - So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60
     \]

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours:
     \[
     \$400 + \$60 = \$460
     \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are \$460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen donuts costs $68.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 dozen donuts is:
     \[
     3 \times 68 = 204
     \]
   So, the cost for the donuts is $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 dozen mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     2 \times 80 = 160
     \]
   So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.
   - Therefore, the cost for 6 dozen mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     6 \times 55 = 330
     \]
   So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

So, the total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find out when it becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the total cost each year:
- The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
- The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and he sells each lemon for $1.5.

The revenue from selling the lemons each year is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year:
\[ \text{Net profit/year} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90 and the net profit each year is $7.5, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Net profit/year} \times \text{Number of years} = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times \text{Number of years} = \$90 \]

Solving for the number of years:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
5. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Let's solve this equation step by step.

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
\]
So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this by going through the steps again with \( x = 18 \):

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, our solution is correct. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, the number of students in hip-hop dance is 12. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students that enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Current value of jewelry: $5,000
- Market growth rate for jewelry: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Jewelry} = 5125 \]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Current value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Market growth rate for electronic gadgets: 1.2%

Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Current Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} = 8096 \]

Now, we compare the future values to determine which purchase will yield a higher profit:
- Future value of jewelry: $5,125
- Future value of electronic gadgets: $8,096

The electronic gadgets will have a higher future value, so the merchant should choose to purchase the electronic gadgets.

To find the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Future Value of Electronic Gadgets} - \text{Current Value of Electronic Gadgets} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 8096 - 8000 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 96 \]

So, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Now, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
\[ \$35,000/\text{year} + \$22,500/\text{year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \$57,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day:**
   Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.

2. **Calculate how many eggs she uses in one week:**
   There are 7 days in a week. So, if she uses 3 eggs each day, in one week she will use:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:**
   If she uses 21 eggs in one week, in 4 weeks she will use:
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens of eggs 84 eggs is, we divide 84 by 12:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. To find the total time she should take to achieve this average speed, we use the formula for average speed:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]
Given that the average speed is 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can solve for the total time:
\[
4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking, so the remaining time she needs to hike is:
\[
3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

The remaining distance is:
\[
12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we can calculate the amount of water as follows:

\[ \text{Amount of water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \text{ liters} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we can calculate the amount of water as follows:

\[ \text{Amount of water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \text{ liters} = \frac{45}{5} \text{ liters} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the amounts of water from both drinks:

\[ \text{Total amount of water} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} + 9 \text{ liters} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 1 is 3, so we convert 9 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

\[ 9 = \frac{27}{3} \]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[ \text{Total amount of water} = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

We spill one liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of liquid:

\[ \text{Remaining liquid} = 10 \text{ liters} + 15 \text{ liters} - 1 \text{ liter} = 24 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we need to find out how much of this remaining 24 liters is water. Since the total amount of water is \(\frac{47}{3}\) liters, we can find the fraction of the remaining liquid that is water:

\[ \text{Fraction of water in remaining liquid} = \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{24} = \frac{47}{3 \times 24} = \frac{47}{72} \]

To find the numerical value of this fraction:

\[ \text{Amount of water in remaining liquid} = \frac{47}{72} \times 24 = \frac{47 \times 24}{72} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15.67} \]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is now 31 years old, Raymond is:

\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. So, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is now 25 years old, the number of years that have passed since Raymond's son was born is:

\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday.
2. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD. So, 3 customers * 1 DVD each = 3 DVDs.
3. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs. So, 2 customers * 2 DVDs each = 4 DVDs.
4. The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. So, 3 customers * 0 DVDs each = 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add up all the DVDs sold:
3 DVDs (from the first 3 customers) + 4 DVDs (from the next 2 customers) + 0 DVDs (from the last 3 customers) = 7 DVDs.

So, the final numerical answer is 7."

   - The candle starts burning at 1:00 PM and stops at 5:00 PM.
   - The time difference between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

2. Calculate the total melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the total melting would be \( 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \).

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid $19.50 which is 75% of the original price (since a 25% discount means he paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price).

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Given that 75% of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
243"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia will buy and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's find out how many servings of ice cream Cynthia eats in 60 days:
- Cynthia eats 1 serving per night.
- There are 60 days.

So, the total number of servings she eats in 60 days is:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs to buy to get 60 servings. Each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

First, we know the total distance of Henry's trip is 60 miles.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. So, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance to his first stop from the distance to his second stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, the second pair of heels costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

Now, we can find the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if the boots cost \(B\) dollars, then:
\[ B = 99 + 5 = 104 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the boots cost 104 dollars. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"

"To find the average guess, we need to first determine each friend's guess and then find the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The average is calculated by adding the guesses together and then dividing by the number of guesses.

The total of the guesses is:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

There are 3 guesses, so the average is:

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total time John spends on one dog per day.
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total time John spends on all 10 dogs per day.
   - Since John has 10 dogs, we multiply the time spent on one dog by the number of dogs:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

3. Calculate the total time John spends on all 10 dogs per week.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we can calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has as follows:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23

"First, let's find out how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. We know he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points scored in the first 20 minutes to the points scored in the second 20 minutes to get the total points.

Total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we know that each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00. To find out the total cost for 15 sets, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. To find out how much money he had initially, we add the money he spent on video games to the money he has left.

\[ \$160 \text{ (spent on video games)} + \$5 \text{ (left over)} = \$165 \]

This means John initially had $165. We can verify this by subtracting the money he spent on video games from the initial amount.

\[ \$165 - \$160 = \$5 \]

This confirms that John indeed has $5 left after buying the video games.

Since John started with 13 lego sets and he has not sold or bought any more lego sets, he still has 13 lego sets.

The final numerical answer is:

13"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in those 3 hours and then find his average speed.

First, let's determine the distance John runs each day:

- On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:

- Distance on the first day: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \)
- Distance on the second day: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \)
- Distance on the third day: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times \text{speed} \)

The total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{speed} + 1.5 \times \text{speed} + 1.5 \times \text{speed} = 60 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 3 \times \text{speed} + 1.5 \times \text{speed} + 1.5 \times \text{speed} = 3 \times \text{speed} + 3 \times \text{speed} = 6 \times \text{speed} \]

So, we have:

\[ 6 \times \text{speed} = 60 \]

Now, solve for speed:

\[ \text{speed} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, we can calculate her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much time Dana spends running and walking. The total time she spends is 6 hours. One-third of the time she spends running, and two-thirds of the time she spends walking. So, we calculate the time spent running and walking as follows:

\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she can travel while running and walking. The distance she can travel while running is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance she can travel while walking is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

We know her walking speed is four times her walking speed, and since her running speed is 6 miles per hour, her walking speed is:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the distance she can travel while walking is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels while running and walking:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

So, the distance outside the reach of the dragon's flames is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones cut each of the 5 apple pies into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"First, let's find out how many calories are in one serving of the bag of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.

So, the total calories in the 300g bag is:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.

So, the remaining calories you can consume for the day is:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Each serving of chips has 250 calories. To find out how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g, we can find out how many grams you can eat by multiplying the number of servings by the grams per serving:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

Next, we calculate the cost of the beeswax and the wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, then the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$40.00 - \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of articles written on each day:**
   - On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
     \[
     5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   \[
   5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased. Let's break down the information given:

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She purchased a package of Post-it notes.
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After placing the Post-it notes on the coffee cups, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

First, we need to find out how many Post-it notes she used in total. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. So, the total number of Post-it notes she used is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now, we know that the total number of Post-it notes she had initially (80) plus the number of Post-it notes she purchased (\( x \)) equals the total number of Post-it notes she used (243). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find out how much John spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is 4 feet long, which is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets from his chickens per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs per day by 12:

\[ \text{Dozens of eggs per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Lloyd makes from selling these eggs per day. Since he sells each dozen for $2, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times 0.25 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 7.5 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for Thursday and Friday separately, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, and each truck tire repair costs $60. So, the revenue from truck tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repaired 4 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40. So, the revenue from car tires on Thursday is:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday is:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:
- The mechanic repaired 12 car tires, and each car tire repair costs $40. So, the revenue from car tires on Friday is:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic did not repair any truck tires on Friday, so the revenue from truck tires on Friday is:
  \[
  0 \times 60 = 0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total revenue on Friday is:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out which day had the higher revenue and by how much:
- The revenue on Thursday is $520.
- The revenue on Friday is $480.
- The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
  \[
  520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.
2. We also know that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. So, if the adopted kittens are 7, then Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.
3. Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Now, let's add up all the kittens:

- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

So, the total number of kittens is \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:

\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \text{ lollipops left} \]

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:

\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \]

So, Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for one trip and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

The cost for one trip includes:
- A ticket for $7
- Popcorn for $7

So, the total cost for one trip is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times he can spend $14 from his $42. We do this by dividing $42 by $14:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. We know the following:

1. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
3. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

First, we need to find out how much weight the boxes can add to the truck without exceeding the bridge's limit. We do this by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

This means the boxes can add up to 1245 pounds to the truck. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we need to determine how many boxes can be added without exceeding 1245 pounds:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83. Let's verify this:

If 83 boxes are loaded, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 83 \times 15 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this to the weight of the driver and the empty truck:

\[ 3755 + 1245 = 5000 \text{ pounds} \]

This is exactly the bridge's weight limit, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is indeed 83.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the original total of the groceries, which is $40.00.
2. Add the 25% delivery fee to the original total.
3. Add the $3.00 delivery fee.
4. Add the $4.00 tip.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. The original total is $40.00.
2. The 25% delivery fee is calculated as 25% of $40.00:
   \[
   0.25 \times 40 = 10
   \]
   So, the delivery fee is $10.00.
3. Adding the delivery fee to the original total:
   \[
   40 + 10 = 50
   \]
4. Adding the $3.00 delivery fee:
   \[
   50 + 3 = 53
   \]
5. Adding the $4.00 tip:
   \[
   53 + 4 = 57
   \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries/cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters:

\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2
- Good oranges: rest of the oranges

Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges:

20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges are good:

Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17.

The final numerical answer is:
17"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance. Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. So, the total cost is:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of this total cost for insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the brooch to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

\[ 1430 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Pension**: Marcy gets a pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
   - So, for the first 20 years, her pension is $50,000/year.

2. **After 20 Years**: After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at this point is $50,000/year.
   - 5% of $50,000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \).
   - So, after 20 years, her pension becomes $2,500/year.

3. **Pension for the Next 10 Years**: Marcy works for another 10 years (total of 30 years) after the first 20 years.
   - For the next 10 years, her pension is $2,500/year.

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $2,500.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the monthly cost for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly cost is $140.
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - So, the total cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840
     \]

2. **Calculate the monthly cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The streaming company charges 10% less on the second half of the year.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     140 \times 0.10 = 14
     \]
   - Subtract this amount from the original monthly cost:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - So, the monthly cost for the second half of the year is $126.

3. **Determine the total cost for the second half of the year:**
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - So, the total cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the total cost for the first half of the year and the second half of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she used for the 100 miles she traveled. We know that she needed 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again after driving 100 miles. This means that the 4 gallons of gas she used is the amount of gas that was in her tank before she started driving.

Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, and she used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. We do this by setting up a proportion:

\[
\text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
\]

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full 12 gallons of gas, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:

\[
\text{Miles on full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does it.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV. So, the time he spends reading is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, each time he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He does this 3 times a week. Therefore, the total time he spends on TV and reading each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = \text{Number of diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. Since there are 140 rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is:

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate the total amount she received from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the $40 she received from her allowance. Let's denote the amount of money she started with as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and then multiply that by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, and she teaches 5 classes each day:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ classes/day} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Next, we know she teaches 8 classes on Saturday:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \]

Now, let's add the number of classes she teaches on weekdays and Saturday to find the total number of classes in one week:
\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students, so we multiply the total number of classes by the number of students per class to find the total number of students Judy teaches:
\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so we multiply the total number of students by the charge per student to find the total amount of money she makes in one week:

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars/brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ cheesecakes} \times 4 \text{ dollars/cheesecake} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount Tommy raises:

So, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest. Each cell phone costs $150, so:

\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit. So, for 5 cell phones, the total interest is:

\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Now, we add the interest to the original total cost to get the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

We know that the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16. Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

So, let's find the square footage of each level:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: half of Level 4 = 16 / 2 = 8 square feet
- Level 2: half of Level 3 = 8 / 2 = 4 square feet
- Level 1: half of Level 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 square feet

Now we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life in the first year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days.
- So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is \(1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since a year has 365 days:
- The number of days left in the first year is \(365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}\).

For the rest of the puppy's life in the first year, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is:
- \(2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}\).

Now, we add the dog food used in the first 180 days and the dog food used in the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
- Total dog food used in the first year = \(180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}\).

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to get 550 cups of dog food:
- Number of bags needed = \(\frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
5 bags"
"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much David does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, to find out how much Raymond does, we divide Sarah's laundry by 2:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price and then compare it to the cost of buying the same number of flowers at the other price.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Since each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50, we need to find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers.
- \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- So, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3 is \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Since each package of 2 flowers costs $1, we need to find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers.
- \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- So, the total cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2 is \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.
- The difference in cost is \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price (packages of 2 for $1 each).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the discount amount. The original cost of grooming is $100, and John gets a 30% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply $100 by 30% (or 0.30):

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount amount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost to find out how much John has to pay:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70."
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Water each girl got} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \text{ liters} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ \text{Total water for two girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we know that a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given out is:

\[ \text{Total water given out} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. So, the amount of water left is:

\[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Next, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister:
\[ 54 - 9 = 45 \]

Then, Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card:
\[ 45 - 28 = 17 \]

So, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"First, let's find out how many roses there are in total. Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. So, we multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush:

\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total. Each rose has 8 thorns, so we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be represented as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is given as 22. So we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has. Each quilt block is from a different vacation, and each vacation is represented by one shirt. Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.

First, let's find out how many years Gene has been vacationing:
- Gene is now 34 years old.
- Gene was 23 years old when he started vacationing.
- The difference in age is \(34 - 23 = 11\) years.

Since Gene goes on 4 vacations each year, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has been on over these 11 years:
- Number of vacations per year = 4
- Number of years = 11

Total number of vacations = \(4 \text{ vacations/year} \times 11 \text{ years} = 44 \text{ vacations}\).

Since each vacation is represented by one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the total number of vacations:
- Total number of quilt blocks = 44.

So, the final numerical answer is:
44"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we need to find the total number of times the alarm rang. We add the number of times it rang each time it went off:

\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is 22.

The final numerical answer is:
22"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate Sylvie's salary after three more years of service, given that her salary increases by 10% every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years.

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600.

2. **First Year of Salary Increase**: After one year, her salary increases by 10%.
   \[
   \text{Salary after 1 year} = 600 + 0.10 \times 600 = 600 \times 1.10 = 660
   \]

3. **Second Year of Salary Increase**: After another year, her salary increases by 10% again.
   \[
   \text{Salary after 2 years} = 660 + 0.10 \times 660 = 660 \times 1.10 = 726
   \]

4. **Third Year of Salary Increase**: After another year, her salary increases by 10% again.
   \[
   \text{Salary after 3 years} = 726 + 0.10 \times 726 = 726 \times 1.10 = 798.60
   \]

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{798.60}

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8000 \]"
"First, let's determine how many guests will actually attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, 1/4 of 16 is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags Christina needs. She plans to give .75 gift bags per invited guest. Since 12 guests will attend, the total number of gift bags needed is:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for 9 gift bags is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much potato salad the adults will eat. Since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad and there are 20 adults:

\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half as much as an adult, each child eats:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad the children will eat is:

\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for the adults and the children:

\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 225 \]"
"First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:

\[ \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

\[ \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together. We add the number of pets each of them has:

\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is:

\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how fast Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee runs it in 38 seconds.

Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how fast he can now run, we need to calculate 10% of his old time and then subtract it from his old time.

10% of 40 seconds is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald's new time is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the number of dogs is 60.
2. We are told that there are two cats for every dog. So, if there are 60 dogs, then the number of cats is \(60 \times 2 = 120\).
3. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). The number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).
4. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The final numerical answer is:
348"
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls there are in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. 

The number of boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total students:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Hours Harry slept} \]
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Hours Harry slept} - \text{Hours James slept} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of tomatoes before they were cooked. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice that of the sauce. So, the original volume of tomatoes is:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used. Since each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars left on the motorway is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
3. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam. Let's call the number of cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes \(x\).
4. After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
5. After all this, the number of cars left on the motorway is 25 - \(x\) - 20 = 5.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[25 - x - 20 = 5\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5 - x = 5\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 5 from both sides:
\[-x = 0\]

Multiplying both sides by -1:
\[x = 0\]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(0\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we multiply the number of ledges by the number of plants per ledge:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 2 \text{ plants/ledge} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ ledges} \times 1 \text{ plant/ledge} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, to find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she plans to give away from the total number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we need to add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

So, the total number of doorbell rings is \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\).

Pages from History textbook: 7 pages
Pages from Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday.

Pages left to read = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading.

To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left.

Pages per day = Pages left to read / Number of days left
Pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days."
"Let's break down John's water consumption:

- John drinks water with his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- So, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays.
- Therefore, in a week, he drinks \(3 \times 5 = 15\) glasses of water on weekdays.

- On weekends, he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water.
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- So, he drinks 0 glasses of water on weekends.

Now, let's add up the total:

- Water consumption on weekdays: 15 glasses
- Water consumption on weekends: 0 glasses

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(15 + 0 = 15\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

First, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

We can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to cover 42 miles. Let's call the time it takes to cover 42 miles \( T \).

The proportion is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{T \text{ minutes}} \]

To find \( T \), we can cross-multiply and solve for \( T \):
\[ 3T = 42 \times 10 \]
\[ 3T = 420 \]
\[ T = \frac{420}{3} \]
\[ T = 140 \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To solve this, let's break down the TV watching hours for each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 0.5 hour (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 4.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the remaining time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours (total) - 4.5 hours (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) = 2.5 hours

Since he watched 30 minutes (0.5 hour) on Wednesday, the remaining time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
2.5 hours - 0.5 hour = 2 hours

Since each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hour), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
2 hours / 0.5 hour per episode = 4 episodes

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry meant to bake \( x \) cookies this year.
2. He actually baked twice as many as he meant to, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He then realized he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually baked \( 2x = x + 15 \).
4. From this, we can solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = x + 15
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   x = 15
   \]
   So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies this year.
5. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, he baked:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ cookies}
   \]
6. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25 \text{ cookies}
   \]
7. We are told that now he has a total of 110 cookies. This means that the 25 cookies he has now plus the cookies he didn't drop (which is the same as the cookies he meant to bake) should add up to 110:
   \[
   25 + 15 = 40 \text{ cookies}
   \]
   But we know he has 110 cookies now, so the 110 cookies include the 25 he has now plus the 85 cookies he didn't drop (since \( 110 - 25 = 85 \)).

So, Henry meant to bake 15 cookies this year, and that is the number of cookies he baked last year as well, since he meant to bake twice as many as last year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

Cost per gallon = $3.00
Number of gallons = 10

Total cost without cashback = Cost per gallon × Number of gallons
Total cost without cashback = $3.00 × 10 = $30.00

Next, let's calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons:

Cashback per gallon = $0.20
Number of gallons = 10

Total cashback = Cashback per gallon × Number of gallons
Total cashback = $0.20 × 10 = $2.00

Now, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost without cashback to find the final cost after cashback:

Final cost after cashback = Total cost without cashback - Total cashback
Final cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, the final numerical answer is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each person.

For Marcell:
- He has a fruit roll-up that is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we multiply the width by the length: \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

For Beatrice:
- She has a fruit roll-up that is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we multiply the width by the length: \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Now, to find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups each ate and then divide by 2 (since there are two people).

So, the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten is \(42 + 48 = 90\).

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

The final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine how many seconds it took Julia to row 10 feet. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, it took her 8 seconds to row 10 feet.

Next, we need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in the 64-second rowing time. We do this by dividing 64 seconds by 8 seconds per 10 feet:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{8 \text{ seconds/10 feet}} = 8 \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Since Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the number of 10-foot segments by 2 liters:

\[ 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board costs $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board costs $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue if Sasha sells all the leftover lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's add up the total revenue from all the leftover lumber:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

First, let's denote the number of parts of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of parts of water as \(13x\). The total number of parts (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water) is therefore \(7x + 13x = 20x\).

We know that the total number of parts (teaspoons of sugar and cups of water) is 120. So, we can set up the equation:
\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoons of sugar. Since the number of parts of sugar is \(7x\), we substitute \(x = 6\) into the expression:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

So, the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he buys a total of:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times $60/\text{pair} = $360 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ $360 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of vehicles initially at the port.
2. Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Determine the number of containers imported on the second day.

First, let's find out how many vehicles were initially at the port. There were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since each pad has 30 sheets, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's determine how many fruits Kael brought.

Morisette brought:

- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette: \(5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits}\)
- Kael: \(10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits}\)

Next, we add the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:
\[ 13 \text{ fruits} + 14 \text{ fruits} = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to break down the problem day by day and then sum up the total hours.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 8 \text{ (Friday)} \]

Let's add these up step by step:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]
\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \]
\[ 27 + 8 = 35 \]

So, Sadie slept a total of 35 hours throughout the week.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The total time she runs is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate how far she can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts of her run:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. So, she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

This means that the 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters include the 20 letters that Jennie stamped plus some letters that were already stamped before Jennie started. 

So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Julia originally had \( x \) plastic spoons.
2. She bought a new package of spoons, which we'll call \( y \).
3. Her husband then bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
5. After all this, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of spoons Julia had after all the transactions:

\[ x + y + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + y + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x + y = 10 \]

We know that \( x \) (the original number of spoons) is unknown, but we need to find \( y \) (the number of spoons in the package Julia bought). Since the problem doesn't give us the original number of spoons, we can assume that the number of spoons Julia originally had is not relevant to finding \( y \). We can solve for \( y \) directly:

\[ y = 10 - x \]

Since \( x \) is not specified and we are only asked for the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can conclude that:

\[ y = 10 - x \]

But since we are only asked for the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, and we know the total number of spoons after the transactions, we can directly state:

\[ y = 10 - x \]

Given the problem's context and the fact that we are only asked for the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can conclude:

\[ y = 10 - x \]

Since the problem doesn't specify \( x \), we can assume \( x = 0 \) for simplicity, which gives us:

\[ y = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. To find the total number of sausages, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together:

So, the final numerical answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - **Watermelons:**
     Dillon buys 4 watermelons.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Peppers:**
     Dillon buys 20 peppers.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Oranges:**
     Dillon buys 10 oranges.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times \text{Cost of an orange} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total minutes by 60 to get the number of hours.

Total minutes seen per day = 500 people * 24 minutes per person
Total hours seen per day = Total minutes seen per day / 60

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from the patients and the hospital's charges.

Revenue from patients = Total hours seen per day * $200 per hour
Revenue from the hospital = Total hours seen per day * $150 per hour

Finally, the profit is calculated by subtracting the hospital's cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Revenue from patients - Revenue from the hospital

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total minutes seen per day = 500 * 24 = 12000 minutes
2. Total hours seen per day = 12000 / 60 = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate the revenue:

Revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200 per hour = $40000
Revenue from the hospital = 200 hours * $150 per hour = $30000

Finally, the profit:

Profit = $40000 - $30000 = $10000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10000 from these visits."
"First, let's determine how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we calculate:

\[

\]

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. This means the number of elves remaining after this is:

\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract these 10 elves from the 40 remaining elves:

\[
40 - 10 = 30
\]

Therefore, the number of elves left is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the number of tickets Pam used.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

Then, Pam rode the luge 2 times, so she used:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

So, the total number of tickets Pam used is:
\[ 12 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of tickets Fred used.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used:
\[ 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 24 \text{ tickets} \]

Then, Fred rode the luge 2 times, so he used:
\[ 2 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets/ride} = 12 \text{ tickets} \]

So, the total number of tickets Fred used is:
\[ 24 \text{ tickets} + 12 \text{ tickets} = 36 \text{ tickets} \]

Now, let's find the total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred.

The total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred is:

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chips:
- Rory orders 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each.
- So, the cost for the chips is \( 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the cookies:
- Rory orders 2 cookies for $1.00 each.
- So, the cost for the cookies is \( 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
- Total cost before delivery fee and tip is \( 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00 \) dollars.

Next, we need to add the 20% delivery fee:
- The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00.
- So, the delivery fee is \( 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00 \) dollars.

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost:
- Total cost before tip is \( 20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip:

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens (Q), we can find the number of baby bees (B):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees (W):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400."

- Tax on light bulbs = $3 * 10% = $3 * 0.10 = $0.30.
- Tax on roach traps = $4 * 10% = $4 * 0.10 = $0.40.

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items:

- Total cost for light bulbs including tax = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30.
- Total cost for roach traps including tax = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items. The food items are milk and eggs.

- Milk costs $2.
- Eggs cost $3.

The total cost of the food items is:

- Total cost for milk and eggs = $2 + $3 = $5.

Now, we add the total cost of the food items and the total cost of the nonfood items:

- Total cost = $5 (food items) + $3.30 (light bulbs) + $4.40 (roach traps) = $12.70.

So, the final numerical answer is:

$12.70"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the supplies for each client. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
The cost of 1 pack of cloths is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total cost for supplies for each client is:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ 92 - 72 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pineapples John can harvest from one hectare in a year.

John harvests every 3 months, so in a year (which has 12 months), he can harvest:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ times} \]

Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, in one hectare, he can harvest:
\[ 100 \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples} \]

Now, John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. So, the total number of pineapples he can harvest from all 10 hectares in a year is:
\[ 400 \times 10 = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, so it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125. 

The final numerical answer is:
2125"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   She sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. So, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours. So, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:**
   Every bee that left before had not already returned. From the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and from the next 6 hours, 60 bees left. So, the total number of bees that left is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Since all these bees had not returned by the end of the first 12 hours, they all return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change Brittany's mom received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ 30 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many friends Dorothy has first, and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to convert the distance Steve lives from the school into feet because his speed is given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Steve to bike to his house is:

\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 35.54545454545454 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the distance Tim lives from the school into feet:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for Tim to skateboard to his house is:

\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now we compare the times:
- Steve takes 35.54545454545454 minutes.
- Tim takes 40 minutes.

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 35.54545454545454 \text{ minutes} = 4.45454545454546 \text{ minutes} \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the difference is approximately 4.45 minutes.

So, the winner (Tim) will be waiting at their house for the loser (Steve) for:

\[ \boxed{4.45} \text{ minutes} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for all the people who came to Shawnda's place.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles.
- Total cost for the bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * 25 cents/tire = 5 * 2 * 25 cents = 250 cents.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles.
- Total cost for the tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * 25 cents/tire = 3 * 3 * 25 cents = 225 cents.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle.
- Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * 25 cents/tire = 1 * 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = 250 cents (bicycles) + 225 cents (tricycles) + 25 cents (unicycle) = 500 cents.

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. So, before the raccoon, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave ate 14 fries, and the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. This means that before the seagull ate, there were \(24 + 14 + 7 = 45\) fries.
4. The large pack of fries that Dave bought originally had 45 fries.

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up for the entire semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- So, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
- Therefore, the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- So, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday, Thursday).
- Therefore, the total hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's find the total hours Kimo spends on all days in one week:
- Total hours per week = Hours on Monday, Wednesday, Friday days + Hours on Tuesday, Thursday days
- Total hours per week = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly total by 16:
- Total hours in one semester = \(17 \times 16\).

Let's calculate \(17 \times 16\):
- \(17 \times 16 = 17 \times (10 + 6) = (17 \times 10) + (17 \times 6) = 170 + 102 = 272\).

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

The final numerical answer is:
272"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls = 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- Total length = 1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches.

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we use the fact that 1 foot = 12 inches:
- Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in one month:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months, we multiply the monthly total by 2:
\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1400 \]"
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs back and forth, he covers 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 200 yards, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each time she runs to the 40-yard line and back, she covers 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). So, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 of them come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 of them hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
2. Use the depth on Tuesday to find the depth on Wednesday.

First, we know the depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet. So, we calculate the depth on Tuesday as follows:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = \text{Depth on Monday} + 7 = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the depth on Wednesday. The depth on Wednesday is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday. So, we calculate the depth on Wednesday as follows:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Depth on Tuesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is the sum of the starfish, sea horses, and clownfish:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

"First, let's find out the price increase per two months. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20. A 20% increase on $20 is calculated as follows:

\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

So, the price increases by $4 every two months. 

Next, we need to determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months. Each time the price increases by $4, we can calculate the new price by adding $4 to the previous price. 

Let's denote the price after \( n \) two-month periods as \( P_n \). The initial price \( P_0 \) is $20. After the first two months, the price \( P_1 \) will be:

\[ P_1 = 20 + 4 = 24 \]

After the second two months, the price \( P_2 \) will be:

\[ P_2 = 24 + 4 = 28 \]

We can see that the price increases by $4 every two months. Therefore, after 18 two-month periods, the price will be:

\[ P_{18} = 20 + 4 \times 18 \]

Now, let's calculate \( 4 \times 18 \):

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

So, the price after 36 months will be:

\[ P_{18} = 20 + 72 = 92 \]

Therefore, the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of one red car. We know that one red car costs $4.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one action figure. The problem states that an action figure costs $5.

Now, we need to find out the cost of the doll. The problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures would cost:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
So, the doll costs $15.

Now we can calculate the total value of all the toys:
- The value of the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\).
- The value of the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- The value of the doll is $15.

Adding these values together gives:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."

So, the total loss if she does her taxes herself is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she would make if she hires an accountant. The accountant charges $90 for the service.

To find out how much more money she would have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the amount she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

So, the additional money she would have if she hires the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$15 \]"

"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many eggs are needed to make one flan.
2. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
3. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get the required number of eggs.

Step 1: Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan.

Step 2: To make 15 flans, we multiply the number of eggs needed for one flan by the number of flans:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/flan} \times 15 \text{ flans} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 3: Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \). Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age can be denoted as \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Next, we solve for \( B \):

\[ 3B + 4 - 4 = 28 - 4 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:

\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 51."
"First, let's calculate the amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
- Minimum payment: $300/month
- 50% more than minimum: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

For the credit card:
- Minimum payment: $200/month
- 50% more than minimum: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

For the mortgage:
- Minimum payment: $500/month
- 50% more than minimum: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Now, let's add up the monthly payments:
- Student loans: $450/month
- Credit card: $300/month
- Mortgage: $750/month

Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:
- Yearly payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $18000/year

So, the final numerical answer is:
18000"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato and the time it takes to cut one potato.

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time for each task by 60.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds

Now, let's calculate these values.

- Total time to peel 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:

- Total time to cut 60 potatoes in minutes: \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes

Now, we add the total time to peel and the total time to cut:

- Total time to finish prepping the potatoes: \( 90 \) minutes (peeling) + \( 5 \) minutes (cutting) = \( 95 \) minutes

So, the final numerical answer is:

95 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue from one gallon is:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons they sold to make a profit of $25. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar. Let's denote the number of gallons they sold as \( x \). The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:

\[ \$10 \times x \]

The total cost for \( x \) gallons is the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost is:

\[ (\$3 + \$2) \times x = \$5 \times x \]

The profit is given as $25, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \$10 \times x - \$5 \times x = \$25 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ \$5 \times x = \$25 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:

\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \$15 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. Let's write the final answer:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after these expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after these expenses.

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - (1500 + 2000) = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount after the donation.

\[ \text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.

\[ \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, let's find out how much money Zaid will have left after giving money to his daughter and wife.

\[ \text{Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

So, the final amount of money Zaid will have after all these expenses and donations is 350$."
"First, let's determine how many crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, we add up the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together:
\[ 46 + 36 + 40 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received.

The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes.

Next, we need to find out how many votes the loser received. Since the total number of votes is 80 and the winner received 60 votes, the loser must have received the remaining votes:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

According to the problem:
- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
- Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we need to find the value of \( w \) from the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

We need to find Jean's age.

From the information given, we know Jan's current age is 30. So, two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years.

Now, let's use the second piece of information. Two years ago, Mark's age was 28 - 2 = 26 years. According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 5 + \frac{\text{Jan's age two years ago}}{2} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 26 = 5 + \frac{28}{2} \]

\[ 26 = 5 + 14 \]

\[ 26 = 19 \]

This equation checks out, confirming our values for Mark's and Jan's ages two years ago.

Now, we need to find Mark's current age. Since Mark was 26 two years ago, his current age is 26 + 2 = 28 years.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 28 + 2 = 30 years.

So, the final numerical answer is:

30"
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, and there are four members.

\[
\text{Total time for faster team} = 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third).

\[
\text{Total time for slower team} = 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds}
\]

Let's add these times together:

\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in time between the faster team and the slower team:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, the faster team will win by:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"If Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked:

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Hamsters' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per cage} = 50 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Rabbits' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is:
     \[
     20 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Total Straw Distributed to Small Rodents:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed to the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - We already know that 50 pieces are given to the hamsters and 20 pieces are given to the rabbits.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Rats' Straw Distribution:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:
     \[
     3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats per cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces per rat} = 18r \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - We know this total is 90 pieces:
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]

5. **Solving for \( r \):**
   - To find \( r \), divide both sides of the equation by 18:
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
     \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months, including the interest.

First, let's find the interest for one month:
- The initial amount Mandy owes is $100.
- The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be written as 0.02 in decimal form.

The interest for one month is:
\[ \text{Interest for one month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for the second month is also 2 dollars, and the same for the third month.

Now, let's calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Next, we add the total interest to the initial amount to find the total amount Mandy owes after 3 months:
\[ \text{Total amount after 3 months} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 106 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The trader buys some bags of wheat at $20 per bag.
   - Let's say the trader bought \( x \) bags of wheat.
   - The total cost of buying the wheat is \( 20x \) dollars.

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
   - The total cost of transporting \( x \) bags is \( 2x \) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for buying and transporting the wheat is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The trader sells each bag at $30.
   - If the trader sold \( y \) bags, the total revenue is \( 30y \) dollars.

5. **Profit calculation:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, \( 30y - 22x = 400 \).

6. **Selling price and profit relationship:**
   - We know the trader sold all the bags, so \( y = x \).
   - Substituting \( y = x \) into the profit equation, we get:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost for rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect in 3 hours.

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much each duck needs to eat per week. We know that the total amount of insects needed by the flock of ten ducks is 3.5 pounds per week. So, we divide this by the number of ducks to find out how much one duck eats per week:
   \[
   \text{Insects per duck per week} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ ducks}} = 0.35 \text{ pounds per duck per week}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much each duck eats per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
   \[
   \text{Insects per duck per day} = \frac{0.35 \text{ pounds per week}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.05 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

3. Finally, to find out how much the entire flock of ten ducks needs per day, we multiply the daily amount for one duck by the number of ducks:
   \[
   \text{Total insects per day for the flock} = 0.05 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day."
"First, let's calculate the net increase in the number of trees Tom has each year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, considering the initial number of trees and the net increase each year. Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees would be:

\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130:

\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

So, the number of trees left after 30% die is:

\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Friday morning after the prank:**
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

4. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors put back the newly painted white flamingos:**
   - So, the number of white flamingos on Saturday morning is 6.

5. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - So, the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

6. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

7. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, let's break down the problem month by month.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month:**
   She collected three times the number she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
   So, after the first month, she has:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total each week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day.
2. Multiply the total number of pails by the number of liters each pail contains.

First, let's find out how many pails of water Baldur gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- So, the total number of pails in a day is \(5 + 6 = 11\) pails.

Next, we know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. Therefore, the total number of liters of water he gets in a day is:
- \(11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

So, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters."
"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise.

John's original salary is $2000 per week. A 5% raise means he gets an additional 5% of $2000.

\[ \text{Raise amount} = 2000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \]

So, his new salary after the raise is:

\[ \text{New salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]

Now, let's calculate how much he makes in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ \text{Total yearly salary} = 2100 \times 52 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

So, John made $109,200 that year.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{109200} \]"
"First, let's find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we can calculate the total tons of grapes as follows:

\[ \text{Tons of grapes per year} = \text{Number of acres} \times \text{Tons per acre} \]
\[ \text{Tons of grapes per year} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total barrels of wine as follows:

\[ \text{Barrels of wine per year} = \text{Tons of grapes per year} \times \text{Barrels per ton} \]
\[ \text{Barrels of wine per year} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total, we need to break down the problem into parts and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 10 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese used = 10 + 9 + 8 = 27 slices.

So, the final numerical answer is 27."
"First, let's calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens we bought, we get:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93. Here's how we can approach it:

1. First, we need to calculate the sum of the scores of the first five tests:
   - 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440

2. Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \).

3. The average of the six tests will be the sum of the scores of the six tests divided by 6. We want this average to be 93:
   \[
   \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93
   \]

4. To find \( x \), we can solve the equation:
   \[
   440 + x = 93 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   440 + x = 558
   \]
   \[
   x = 558 - 440
   \]
   \[
   x = 118
   \]

So, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
118"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike in two different periods and then add those totals together.

First, let's calculate the kilometers he rode in the first four weeks:
- He rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} = 125 \text{ km/week} \]

For four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is:
\[ 125 \text{ km/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the kilometers he rode in the next three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.

So, in one week, he rode:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} = 120 \text{ km/week} \]

For three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is:
\[ 120 \text{ km/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods to get the total:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

So, the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"First, let's find out how much each candied apple weighs. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple must weigh half of that:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

The total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

The total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2600 \]"
"First, let's determine how many cakes Rose bought on each day.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]
So, on Tuesday, she bought 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]
So, on Wednesday, she bought 60 cakes.

Now, to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 76 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts to understand it better.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - A dozen is 12, so half a dozen is 6.
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\).

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\).

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800, one dozen cups cost \(34800 \div 20 = 1740\).

4. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen is 12, so the cost of one cup is \(1740 \div 12 = 145\).

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

The final numerical answer is:
145"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes together:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also earns money from mowing the lawn. Let's say she mows the lawn \( x \) times. Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4:
\[ 4x \]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn \( x \) times is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs collected each day is given by:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

We are also given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

Now we can substitute \( w \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. Let's verify this by calculating the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:
\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, since that's the distance he walks. The park is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Let's calculate the perimeter:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find out how many customers were counted on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. So, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other since they both equal \( B \):
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's check the big pool's current amount of water:
\[ B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = -8 \) gallons, which is not possible, so we need to recheck the problem constraints. The correct interpretation is that the big pool had 16 gallons 4 minutes ago and the small pool had -8 gallons, which is not possible in reality, but the problem setup is consistent with the given equations.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of her purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in total.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: 
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages divided by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, half of Naomi's points is:
\[ \frac{68}{2} = 34 \]
Then Yuri scored:
\[ 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored:
\[ 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's points can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 54 \]"
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles together:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"First, let's determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters to water her garden.

The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. After using 90 liters, the remaining water is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of the water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank to find the total amount of water in the tank now:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's find out how many petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, the final numerical answer is 140."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount spent on advertising for the second year.
2. Add the amounts spent in the first and second years.

First, we know the company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, the company spends a third of that amount. So, we calculate the amount spent on the second year as follows:

\[
\text{Amount spent on the second year} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Now, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total amount spent over the two years:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:

\[
\boxed{20000}

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, he has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

He buys 14 more grass type cards, so the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the base burrito and all the additional items Chad added:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Chad also decided to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, so we add that to the total:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together in one minute:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. We know that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest after the first two months is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, Ashlyn came back two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we need to calculate 3/4 of 84:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = \frac{3 \times 84}{4} = \frac{252}{4} = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the two weeks. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, Mark has to pay a 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. To find the tax amount, we multiply the total cost by 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark also needs to pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars. To find the total registration cost, we multiply the registration fee by the number of cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is 25 * 2 = 50 shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"First, let's find out how many penguins jump in the ocean and how many go inside the cave.

There are 36 penguins in total.

One-third of them jump in the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third go inside the cave:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean and 12 penguins go inside the cave.

Now, let's find out how many penguins are left sunbathing. We start with 36 penguins and subtract the 12 that went to the ocean and the 12 that went to the cave:
\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 36 - 24 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's intake} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:

\[ \text{Steve's weekly intake} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Since Steve's girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, her weekly intake is:

\[ \text{Girlfriend's weekly intake} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

So, the total number of tomatoes they eat together in a week is:

\[ \text{Total weekly intake} = 42 + 21 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week. Since one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:

\[ \text{Number of vines} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices John needs. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, we calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[
20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many whole pizzas John needs to order. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[
\frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He can use the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new pen.

Now, let's see how many new pens he can make with the 25 pens he initially bought:

- He can make 25 ÷ 5 = 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens he has.

After making these 5 new pens, he will have used up 25 pens (the original 25) and made 5 new pens. So, the total number of pens he has now is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made:

- Total pens = 25 (original) + 5 (new) = 30 pens.

So, the final number of pens Ram has is 30.

The final numerical answer is:
30"
"Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so he had:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

He then invested this sum of $30, and it tripled in a year. So, the amount after a year is:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

The final numerical answer is 90."
"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:

\[ \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Mary is. We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:

\[ \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, we have the ages of all three girls:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is 25 years old.
- Mary is 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add these numbers together:

\[ \text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Let's calculate the sum:

\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After 300 students left through exit A, the number of students remaining in the hall is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining students went out through exit B. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = \frac{3 \times 700}{5} = \frac{2100}{5} = 420 \]

Now, the number of students who went out through exit C is the rest of the students after those who went through exits A and B have left. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

Given that John has 54 candies:

\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]

To find Robert's candies, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now we know Robert has 27 candies. Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]

Substituting Robert's candies:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count all the books they read.

Dolly reads:
- Her 2 books
- Pandora's 1 book

Pandora reads:
- Her 1 book
- Dolly's 2 books

Now, let's count the total number of books they read:
- Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books
- Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books

So, the total number of books they collectively read is 3 (Dolly's) + 3 (Pandora's) = 6 books.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being pen pals with 2, so he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Now, we need to calculate how long it takes Mike to write 30 pages. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so writing 30 pages will take:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used this month.

He has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day he has a 15-minute call with his boss. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes he uses for his boss's calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for other people.

So, the total number of minutes Jason has used this month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes Jason has left from his 1000-minute plan:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ 250 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 250 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries.
5. After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(27 - 7 = 20\).

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \(32 - 4 = 28\).
3. According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined.
4. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \(f\). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \(2f\).
5. So, we can write the equation: \(28 = 2 \times 2f\).
6. Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get: \(28 = 4f\).
7. To find \(f\), we divide both sides by 4: \(f = \frac{28}{4} = 7\).

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She requires makeup done 4 times a week and it takes 6 hours each time. So, the total hours per week is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/time} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours for the entire movie is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, she gives Jean a 10% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30000:
\[ 10\% \times 30000 = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27000 \]"
"First, let's find the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. We add up all the individual expenses:

- Ingredients for the cake: $12

- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on the party supplies.

Isabelle is splitting this cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost is being divided among three people (Isabelle and her two parents).

To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

So, each person pays $32.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find out how much the chef spent on these onions. We know that a pound of onions costs $1.50. So, we multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Now, let's calculate how many cookies Sue ate on each day.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies}\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies}\]

Now, we need to find out how many calories Sue consumed and how many her sister consumed. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Sue's total calories:
\[46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}\]

Her sister's total calories:
\[18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}\]

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
\[9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories}\]

"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the number of boys and girls in the school is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is 17. Let's confirm this with a final answer.

So, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know from the problem that last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, the total number of animals killed last night is:
\[ 10 \text{ wolves} + 15 \text{ cougars} = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( x \) cougars today. Then he killed \( 3x \) wolves. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so:
\[ x = 15 - 3 = 12 \]
So, today Rick killed 12 cougars and \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed today:
\[ 36 \text{ wolves} + 12 \text{ cougars} = 48 \text{ animals} \]

To find the total number of animals killed over the two days, we add the number of animals killed last night and today:

"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the water slide. We know that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{30}{100} \times 30 = 0.3 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Robert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

"First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections the redwood tree has. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide the total height by the length of each section:

\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the entire redwood tree before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, so 70% of the wood remains. To find the weight of the remaining wood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:

\[ \text{Weight after termites ate} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea should have \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas. But we know Andrea has 52 apples, not bananas, so this part is not directly relevant to the number of fruits Andrea has.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits Andrea has:
- Andrea has 52 apples.
- Andrea has 52 bananas (since the number of bananas is not specified, we assume it's the same as apples for Andrea).

So, the total number of fruits Andrea has is \(52 + 52 = 104\).

\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

Since 5.5 dozens of cookies require 5.5 times the amount of flour needed for 1 dozen cookies, we calculate the total flour needed:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. We know there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, so we calculate two thirds of 9,300:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in two thirds} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01 (one cent), the total dollar amount for 6,200 pennies is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{62}
\]"

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 50 \text{ marbles/box} = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is:

\[ 250 \text{ marbles} + 20 \text{ marbles} = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

The final numerical answer is 270."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we can calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. According to the problem, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we first calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We do this by subtracting the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = \text{Carmen's money} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = \text{Samantha's money} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to get the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 50 \text{ ads} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 15 \text{ ads} = 1125 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

"To find out how much change the mother gets, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. We do this by adding the cost of each item together:

Cost of cocoa = $4.20
Cost of laundry = $9.45
Cost of pasta = $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Let's add these amounts step by step:

First, add $4.20 and $9.45:
$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65

Next, add the result to $1.35:
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

Now, the mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $5.00."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches of the body, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:

- Body: 900 stitches
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

Total stitches for these parts:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 315 \]"

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Sean has to memorize 54 lines for his solo song.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. So, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, Sean has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines for the first scene.
4. The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. So, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. So, Sean has \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Lines for the solo song: 54
- Lines for the first scene: 36

"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This means the remaining cards are:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging both small and large holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time spent on small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes:
Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current ages of Mico and Marco:**
   - Let Mico's current age be \( M \).
   - Let Marco's current age be \( R \).

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The sum of their current ages is 20.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M + R = 20
     \]

3. **Determine their ages in 10 years:**
   - In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \).
   - In 10 years, Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \).

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages in 10 years:**
   - The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
     \[
     (M + 10) + (R + 10)
     \]

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20
     \]

6. **Substitute the known sum of their current ages:**
   - From the equation \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute:
     \[
     M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
     \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. And indeed, \( 45 = 3 \times 15 \), which confirms our solution.

"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has by dividing the number of spots a cobra has by 2:

\[ \text{Spots of a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas combined. We know there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots of cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

We also know there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots of mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots of the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

First, let's list the number of stories each person wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum the total number of stories written by each person over the two weeks:

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- There are three rows of 8 stars each.
- There are two rows of 6 stars each.
- The rest of the stars are in rows of 5 stars.

First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of stars in these rows:

\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, the number of stars that are in rows of 5 stars is:

\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we can find the number of rows of 5 stars by dividing the number of 5-star rows by 5:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"First, let's find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Medals Izzy has} = \text{Medals Ali has} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = \text{Medals Ali has} + \text{Medals Izzy has} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals Ali and Izzy have} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, she takes a 30-minute break. So, the total time she works is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Mike's points:**
   Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.

2. **Determine Jim's points:**
   Jim has 3 points less than Mike. So, Jim's points are:
   \[
   21 - 3 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine Tony's points:**
   Tony has 2 times more points than Mike. So, Tony's points are:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42
   \]

4. **Check if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

5. **Calculate the total points after the extra point is distributed:**
   - Mike's points remain 21.
   - Jim's points remain 18.
   - Tony's points increase by 1 to 43.

6. **Sum the points of all three players:**
   \[
   21 + 18 + 43 = 82

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is 82."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. So, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we'll calculate the number of each exercise Darren does on the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Next, we'll calculate the number of each exercise he does on the second day:
- Pushups: 20 more than the first day, so \(100 + 20 = 120\)
- Squats: 10 fewer than the first day, so \(50 - 10 = 40\)
- Dumbbell presses: Doubles the first day, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\)

Now, we'll calculate the total number of each exercise he does over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Finally, we'll add up all the exercises to get the total count:
\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"First, let's determine how much rice the household consumes in a day.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week.

He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he didn't sell any bread on those days. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, he sold 12 crates, and on Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

So, the total crates sold during the week are:
\[ 20 \text{ (weekend)} + 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} \]

Let's add these numbers:
\[ 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 55 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bidding Pattern**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people.
3. **Number of Bids**: Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, she makes 3 bids in total.
4. **Calculating Each Bid**:
   - First bid: $200
   - Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300

5. **Total Cost**: To find the total cost, we sum up all the bids Carmen made.
   \[
   200 + 250 + 300 = 750
   \]

So, the final amount of money Carmen pays for the antique desk is $750.

"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives in a year.

John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. So, the total distance he drives each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

He goes to work 5 days a week, so the total distance he drives in a week is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

There are 50 weeks in a year, so the total distance he drives in a year is:
\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. The cost is $2 per mile, so:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver per year. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the pages are arranged on a folded piece of paper. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two equal halves. Each half can be further divided into two sections: the left front and the left back, and the right front and the right back.

For a 32-page tabloid, we can think of it as having 16 folded halves. Each folded half will have 2 pages, so we can label the pages as follows:

- The first folded half will have pages 1 and 2.
- The second folded half will have pages 3 and 4.
- And so on, until the 16th folded half which will have pages 31 and 32.

Since each folded half uses one piece of paper, and there are 16 folded halves in a 32-page tabloid, we need 16 pieces of paper.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Now, let's subtract this amount from her initial $50:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Annika spent an additional $10 on rides. We subtract this amount from the remaining $25:

\[
25 - 10 = 15

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means that the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year. So, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold in the first and second years is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
7. The total number of books sold in the three years is 200, so the number of books sold in the third year is \(200 - 135 = 65\).

Now, we need to find out how much money she earned in the second year. Each book sells for $20.

So, the money earned in the second year is \(45 \times 20 = 900\).

The final numerical answer is 900."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate Watson's daily earnings:**
   - Watson works 10 hours a day.
   - He earns $10 per hour.
   - So, his daily earnings = 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day.

2. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings:**
   - Watson works 5 days a week.
   - His weekly earnings = 5 days/week * $100/day = $500/week.

3. **Calculate Watson's monthly earnings:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - If the company performed very well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
   - There are 4 full weeks in April (since 30 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks and 2 days).
   - So, his monthly earnings from his hourly wage = 4 weeks * $500/week = $2000.
   - And his monthly bonus = 4 weeks * $300/week = $1200.
   - Therefore, his total monthly earnings = $2000 + $1200 = $3200.

So, the final numerical answer is $3200."

\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up a proportion based on the weekly weight loss:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"First, let's calculate the discount on one tub of ice cream. The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. So, the discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]

This means each tub of ice cream is now $2 cheaper than its original price.

Next, let's calculate the total discount for 2 tubs of ice cream:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, buying 2 tubs of ice cream will save you $4.

Now, let's consider the packet of milk. The packet of milk was originally sold at a discount of $0.5. We need to find out how much you save by buying 4 packets of milk. Since each packet of milk is sold at a $0.5 discount, the total discount for 4 packets of milk is:

\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \]

So, buying 4 packets of milk will save you $2.

Finally, to find the total savings, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many extra arms and legs the serum will cause a person to grow in 15 days.

First, let's look at the growth of the extra arms:
- The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, we can calculate how many times 3 days fit into 15 days by dividing 15 by 3.
- \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
- So, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

Next, let's look at the growth of the extra legs:
- The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, we can calculate how many times 5 days fit into 15 days by dividing 15 by 5.
- \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \)
- So, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

Now, we need to find the total number of new limbs:
- The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
- Total new limbs = 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- Total cost for business suits = 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- Total cost for suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- Cost of one business suit = $100.
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
- Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for business suits = $600.
- Total cost for suitcases = $150.
- Total cost for the flight ticket = $1200.
- Total cost for all items = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the amount he can spend is:
- Amount he can spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount he can spend to find out how much he can spend on gifts:
- Amount he can spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The final numerical answer is $2050."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people eating different amounts of eggs:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the first group (three people):**
   - Each of the three people eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for the first group per day = 3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the second group (two people):**
   - Each of the two people eats 2 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for the second group per day = 2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the entire family per day:**
   - Total eggs per day = Eggs consumed by the first group + Eggs consumed by the second group
   - Total eggs per day = 9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs.

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago in terms of Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - So, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).
   - Simplifying, \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve this equation, we first need to combine the terms on the left side. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2. So we rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- She invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people with previous commitments} \]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

The final numerical answer is 156 kgs."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (or depth) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Now, let's calculate the volume:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]
\[ V = 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12.

2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. So, if there are 30 boys, the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
3. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys. So, the number of nongendered children is \(1/10 \times 30 = 3\).

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the given ratio and use it to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is given as 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as \( P \) and the number of electric wires as \( W \).

According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find the total number of people at the beginning of the party:

- Number of men: 25
- Number of women: 15

Total number of people = Number of men + Number of women
Total number of people = 25 + 15 = 40

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left the party. So, the number of people who left is:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * Total number of people
Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

This means that 10 people left the party. Since 22 men stayed at the party, we can find out how many men left by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of men:

Number of men who left = Total number of men - Number of men who stayed
Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women. Now, we can find out how many women are left by subtracting the number of women who left from the total number of women:

Number of women who left = Total number of people who left - Number of men who left
Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7

Number of women left = Total number of women - Number of women who left
Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The problem states that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

So, the pen costs $1.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
1

"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which add up to 26 pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). So, the total number of pencils Jam has can be expressed as:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 24 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes, which means she has:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ pencils} \]

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need to store all their pencils, we add the number of pencils Jam and Meg have:
\[ 24 + 46 = 70 \text{ pencils} \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 70 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{70}{8} = 8.75 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the two main factors that weaken the coffee: the cooling by ice cubes and the addition of cream.

First, let's determine how much the coffee is weakened by the cooling by ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and Shannon adds 15 ice cubes. So, the total cooling by ice cubes is:
\[ 15 \text{ ice cubes} \times 13 \text{ degrees per ice cube} = 195 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening due to the addition of cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters. 

Now, we add the weakening due to the cooling and the weakening due to the cream:
\[ 195 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 210 \text{ milliliters} \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is 210 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exchange rate and how many new records are given out for each old record brought in.

1. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.
2. 5 people leave with 7 new records.

To find out how many old records were brought in, we can set up a simple equation based on the exchange rate:

- For every 2 old records, 1 new record is received.
- If 7 new records are received, we need to find out how many old records were traded to get these 7 new records.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Number of old records traded} = 2 \times \text{Number of new records received} \]

Substituting the number of new records received:
\[ \text{Number of old records traded} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior and senior programmers there are.

We know that the total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees. So, the number of junior programmers is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to the junior programmers per month is:
\[ 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

We also know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the amount paid to each senior programmer per month is:
\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to the senior programmers per month is:
\[ 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the amounts paid to the junior and senior programmers:
\[ 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops. Adding these to the remaining lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"First, let's understand the rate at which the cell-phone recharges. The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. 

The phone is currently at 60% charged. To reach 100% charge, it needs to charge an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that it charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase.
   - So, for $80, they get $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After using the rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - The rewards used were $8, so the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - The final price after applying the coupon is $35 - $16 = $19.

So, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, so the gross pay is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30000 - 6000 = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there is a $6,000 property tax, so the net income after property tax is:
\[ 42000 - 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate on the net income after property tax is 10%, so the tax Nick has to pay is:
\[ 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36000 - 3600 = 32400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
\[ 32400 - 24000 = 8400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $8400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for the installments is:
\[ 6 \times 350 = 2,100 \]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is:
\[ 1,350 + 2,100 = 3,450 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

The total cost for the installments is:
\[ 9 \times 250 = 2,250 \]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is:
\[ 1,100 + 2,250 = 3,350 \]

Now, we find the cost difference between the two offers:
\[ 3,450 - 3,350 = 100 \]

The cost difference between the two offers is:

- So, for 8 batches, the sugar needed is \( 30 \times 8 = 240 \) ounces.

Next, let's calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- So, for 1 batch, the sugar needed is \( 70 \times 1 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase:
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + (0.50 \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $12 each, so the value of her shares at the end of the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease:
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - (0.25 \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $9 each, so the value of her shares at the end of the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all of Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The third group, which is the smallest, will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     H = 2C
     \]
   - The total number of animals is 60. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     H + C = 60
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2C + C = 60
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3C = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Now, substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equation \( H = 2C \):
     \[
     H = 2 \times 20 = 40

Now, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos when they started making them.

They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo.
So, the daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

Now, we need to find out how much more they are making per day now compared to when they made tractors.

The difference in daily earnings = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

To find out what percentage more they are making per day now, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New amount} - \text{Old amount}}{\text{Old amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost first and then multiply it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - So, the monthly cost for treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - So, the monthly cost for medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Add the costs of food, treats, and medicine.
   - Total monthly cost = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (months in a year).
   - Total annual cost = $120 \times 12 = $1440.

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"Let's break down the activities and calculate the total time step by step.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as Monday's yoga. So, it is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class. So, it is \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total hours = \(1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2\)

Let's add these up:

\(1 + 3 = 4\)
\(4 + 0.5 = 4.5\)
\(4.5 + 1.5 = 6\)
\(6 + 2 = 8\)

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 8 hours.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's determine how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, we can calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Number of plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:

\[ \text{Total number of plant pots needed} = \text{Number of plant pots for daisies} + \text{Number of plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:

\[ \text{Number of plant pots left over} = \text{Number of plant pots bought} - \text{Total number of plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Andrea started with $36.
2. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11.
3. She also gave her brother $4.

To find out how much money Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount she started with.

So, the calculation is:
\[ \text{Money saved} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Cost of sweater} - \text{Amount given to brother} \]
\[ \text{Money saved} = 36 - 11 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Money saved} = 25 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Money saved} = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

We know that the 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's denote the total time he spent on all activities as \( T \). Therefore:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John also spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we calculate 40% of \( T \):
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she earns from both jobs to find the total amount she has earned:

\[ 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars} \]

Annabelle already had $80 in her savings. So, the total amount she has now is:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, which is 6 feet tall.

\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree.

\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree.

\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2 and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1 and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent:

\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean started with $28 and spent $17, so the amount of money he had left after his purchases is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, we add this to the $11 he had left:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the mini-golf and go-karts.

- The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5.
- The cost for two rides on the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

So, the total cost for these activities is $5 + $20 = $25.

Now, we subtract this total cost from the $90 budget to find out how much money is left for arcade tokens and for Morgan herself.

- Money left after mini-golf and go-karts: $90 - $25 = $65.

Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens, so we subtract this amount from the remaining money.

- Money left after arcade tokens: $65 - $5 = $60.

This $60 is the total amount available for Morgan and her friends. Since each person (including Morgan) gets $5 in arcade tokens, we can find out how many people can share this amount by dividing $60 by $5.

- Number of people: $60 / $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends. The final numerical answer is:

12"
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day.

Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. So, the cost for lollipops each day is:
\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar. So, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets as pocket money each day. She gets $5 every day.

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves each day. This is the difference between the pocket money she gets and the cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Marisa saves $4 each day.

Finally, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. We multiply the daily savings by 5:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since this is half of his change, the total change he had after buying the candy is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train can't go a fraction of a day between services, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the train goes between services every 27 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much stuffing a collie bed requires. We know that a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between these two.

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average stuffing} = \frac{\text{Stuffing for Rottweiler bed} + \text{Stuffing for Chihuahua bed}}{2} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now we know:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to get the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the total distance for the trip to his friend's house including the detour is:

\[ \text{Total distance to friend} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend with detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend with detour}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend with detour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{home}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house and the time back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend with detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{home}} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total trip time is 6 hours."
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to find out how many boys were present on Friday. We know that 5 girls were absent on Friday. Since the total number of absentees is 5 girls and 4 boys, the number of boys absent is 4. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is:

\[ 49 \]

Let's write the final answer in a separate line:

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we add these scores together:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. So, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Customers Refused to Wear Masks:**
   - Number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks = 3

2. **Shoplifting:**
   - Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 4 * (number of customers) - 5
   - Substituting the number of customers: 4 * 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7

3. **Physical Violence:**
   - Number of people kicked out for physical violence = 3 * (number of shoplifters)
   - Substituting the number of shoplifters: 3 * 7 = 21

Now, let's add up the number of people kicked out for each reason:
- Customers for masks: 3
- Shoplifting: 7
- Physical violence: 21

Total for these three reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

- 50 - 31 = 19

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

To find out how many points Sara has now, we multiply her initial score by 3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

So, Sara now has 24 points. Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points by multiplying Sara's current points by 3:
\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

Therefore, Erin now has 72 points. The problem asks for the number of points Erin had before scoring the 14 points. Since the problem does not mention any points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we can only conclude that before scoring the 14 points, Erin had 0 points.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the cost for the picture frames is:
\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to add the additional 20% cost for etching the logo on each picture frame. The additional cost per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total cost for etching the logo on all 44 frames is:
\[ 44 \times 4 = 176 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the picture frames and the etching cost:
\[ 880 + 176 = 1056 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, and each pin costs $5:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. There are 44 seniors, and 1/4 of them are officers:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ officers} \]
Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's find out how much the materials cost for the DIY wallpaper. Since the DIY saves 20% on the market price, it means the DIY price is 80% of the market price.

The market price is $400. So, the DIY price is 80% of $400.

To find 80% of $400, we can calculate it as follows:
\[ \text{DIY price} = 400 \times \frac{80}{100} = 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Double of 14 pairs is \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) pairs.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - The store sold one-half the number of shoes sold on Saturday.
   - Half of 28 pairs is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) pairs.

4. **Returns:**
   - Six pairs of shoes were returned because they didn't fit.
   - Therefore, the number of shoes sold after returns is \( 14 - 6 = 8 \) pairs.

5. **Total Sales:**
   - Add up the sales from Friday, Saturday, and the adjusted Sunday sales.
   - Friday: 14 pairs
   - Saturday: 28 pairs

"First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. We know that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. The total number of pieces can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the cost per piece. However, since we don't know the cost per piece, we can directly use the percentage to find the number of faulty pieces.

The total number of pieces of equipment is:
\[ \text{Total number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Cost per piece}} \]

But since we are only interested in the percentage of faulty pieces, we can directly use the percentage to find the number of faulty pieces:
\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 40\% \times \text{Total number of pieces} \]

Let's denote the total number of pieces as \( N \). Then the number of faulty pieces is:
\[ \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times N \]

The number of functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Number of functioning pieces} = N - \text{Number of faulty pieces} = N - 0.40N = 0.60N \]

The total cost of the functioning pieces is:
\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = 0.60 \times \text{Total cost} = 0.60 \times 400000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:
\[ \text{Total cost of functioning pieces} = 0.60 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:
\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sheep give 1 kg of milk and how many give 2 kg of milk.

Mary has 30 sheep in total. Half of them give 1 kg of milk, and the other half give 2 kg of milk.

So, half of 30 sheep is:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

This means 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk each day, and the other 15 sheep give 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, let's calculate the total milk from the 15 sheep that give 1 kg each:
\[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ kg} \]

Next, let's calculate the total milk from the 15 sheep that give 2 kg each:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total milk collected every day:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

1. Determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday.
2. Determine how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.
3. Determine how many apples Lucy picked on Wednesday.
4. Add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money she got by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of apples picked over the three days:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's understand the information given:

- Lindsay has 50 socks to wash.
- A pair of socks consists of 2 socks.
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks.

To find out how many socks Lindsay has washed, we can calculate as follows:

1. Calculate the number of socks in 10 pairs:
   \[
   10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

2. Add the 15 loose socks to the 20 socks from the pairs:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

Now, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

\[
50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks}
\]

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, Rachel had:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \text{ cookies} \]

Then her brother ate 44 cookies. So, the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \text{ cookies} \]

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment for a loan with a fixed interest rate. The formula to calculate the monthly payment for a loan is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12).
- \( n \) is the total number of payments (loan term in months).

Given:
- \( P = 3650 \) dollars
- Annual interest rate = 10% or 0.10
- Loan term = 5 months

First, we calculate the monthly interest rate \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{0.10}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} = 0.008333 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of payments \( n \):

\[ n = 5 \]

Now, we plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times 0.008333 \times (1 + 0.008333)^5}{(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1} \]

First, calculate \( (1 + r)^n \):

\[ (1 + 0.008333)^5 = 1.043404 \]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[ 3650 \times 0.008333 \times 1.043404 = 30.000000 \]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[ 1.043404 - 1 = 0.043404 \]

Finally, calculate the monthly payment:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{30.000000}{0.043404} = 691.00 \]

So, Karan has to pay $691 per month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 691 \]"
"First, let's calculate how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Cho:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 67 \, \text{km} \]"
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we know that Millie's total cost to make the lemonade is $18. To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he has 2/5 of his land left.
2. We are told that he has 12.8 hectares left, which represents 2/5 of his total land.
3. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to determine what 1/5 of his land is, and then multiply that by 5.

Let's denote the total land Mr. Ruther had at first as \( x \) hectares.

Since 2/5 of \( x \) is 12.8 hectares, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

To make the multiplication easier, we can break it down:
\[ 12.8 \times 2.5 = 12.8 \times \left(2 + 0.5\right) = 12.8 \times 2 + 12.8 \times 0.5 \]
\[ 12.8 \times 2 = 25.6 \]
\[ 12.8 \times 0.5 = 6.4 \]
\[ 25.6 + 6.4 = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.50 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir has 52 members in total and 26 are girls, the remaining members must be boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 52 - 26 = 26
\]

So, the choir has 26 girls and 26 boys. Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we add up all the scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.

So, the cost of the erasers is:
\[ 6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 \text{ per eraser} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.

So, the cost of the pencils is:
\[ 8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 \text{ per pencil} = \$24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
\[ \$12 + \$24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is:
\[ \$36 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many messages Mr. Yu received. We know that Mr. Yu received 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson. Ms. Thompson received 66 messages, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, we add the messages delivered to both teachers to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[ \text{Total messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages delivered is:

\[ 88 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides. So, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides. So, the total number of tickets needed is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets} \]

Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 18 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. David's total cost is $30, and Dasha's total cost is $36. The amount David saves is:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's calculate the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts for her family.
- She has 4 gifts for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts for her teachers.

So, the total number of gifts is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to use it for 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, and then determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \). According to the problem, the ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6} \]

This ratio tells us that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. We can express this relationship as:
\[ B = \frac{5}{6}S \]

We also know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Now, we can substitute \( B = \frac{5}{6}S \) into the equation \( B + S = 165 \):
\[ \frac{5}{6}S + S = 165 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{5S}{6} + \frac{6S}{6} = 165 \]
\[ \frac{11S}{6} = 165 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ 11S = 990 \]
\[ S = \frac{990}{11} \]
\[ S = 90 \]

Now that we know Sam has 90 popsicles, we can find out how many popsicles Betty has by substituting \( S = 90 \) back into the equation \( B = \frac{5}{6}S \):
\[ B = \frac{5}{6} \times 90 \]
\[ B = 75 \]

So, Betty has 75 popsicles and Sam has 90 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the streaming services Tim will get:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount for bundling. So, the discount for each is $10 * 20% = $2.
- Therefore, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 - $2 = $8 each after the discount.

Now, let's add up the costs of Hulu, Disney Plus, and Netflix:
- Hulu: $8
- Disney Plus: $8
- Netflix: $10

Total cost for streaming services = $8 + $8 + $10 = $26

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. So, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and getting the streaming services is:
- $60 - $26 = $34

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time Carol spends into the same unit, such as minutes, to make it easier to calculate.

- Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
- She spends half that much time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.
- She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's add up the total time she spends on all these activities:
- Total time = time spent writing + time spent recording + time spent editing
- Total time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 450 minutes.

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20\% \]"

1. **Determine the total number of slots in the shelving system:**
   - The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   - Each slot can hold one book.
   - Therefore, the total number of slots is:
     \[
     6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots}
     \]

2. **Calculate double the number of slots:**
   - Wendy wants to place double the number of books in the slots.
   - Double the number of slots is:
     \[

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

"Mark currently has $50 and he needs $300 to buy the bike. So, he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, we need to find out how many days it will take for him to earn $250. 

To find the number of days, we divide the amount he needs by the amount he earns per day: $250 ÷ $10/day = 25 days.

So, Mark has to save for 25 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. So, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

"To solve this, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate how many bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to buy.

First, let's find out how much flour and milk are needed for a quadruple batch. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:

- Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
- Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

- For flour: \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)
- For milk: \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:

"First, let's determine how much energy the air conditioner uses in one hour. We know it uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

Next, let's find out how much energy it uses in one day before the reduction. Since it uses 900 watts per hour and it runs for 8 hours a day, the energy used per day is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

So, the new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in one day, we subtract the new daily usage from the original daily usage:
\[ 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} - 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} = 4500 \text{ watt-hours/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4500 \text{ watt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135000 \text{ watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we convert the total energy saved from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
\[ 135000 \text{ watt-hours} \div 1000 = 135 \text{ kWh} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

Next, we need to determine the amount of meat and cheese required for 5 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound. So, we multiply the pounds of each ingredient by their respective costs:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

So, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, the number of corns he has initially is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the new number of cannolis he has is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying the additional cannolis. So, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total number of corns Allan has now is:

\[ \text{Total number of corns} = 80 + 60 = 140 \]

Finally, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{Total number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 140 + 100 = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps from School and Home**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. This means he has taken 5,000 steps so far (half of 10,000).

3. **Additional Steps**: He also took 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, after this, he has taken 6,000 steps (5,000 + 1,000).

4. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before his jog, he had taken 8,000 steps (10,000 - 2,000).

5. **Steps Taken During Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before his jog from the steps he had taken after his jog. So, the steps taken during his jog are 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. He reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it takes to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, which will take 30 minutes. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May:
- Carolyn hired 40 employees.
- Each employee works 40 hours per week.
- Each employee is paid $15 per hour.

The weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$600/\text{week} \]

The total pay for all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{week} = \$24,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid in June:
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. This means 1/4 of the 40 employees' contracts expired.
- The number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

The remaining employees in June are:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The total pay for the remaining 30 employees in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{week} = \$18,000 \]

The total pay for all employees in June is:
\[ 10 \text{ employees} \times \$600/\text{week} = \$6,000 \]

Now, we sum the total pay for May and June:
\[ \$24,000 + \$18,000 + \$6,000 = \$48,000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{48000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally only pays for 1 pound and gets the second pound at half price.

Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy. The cost for the first pound is $3. The second pound is at half price, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets. So, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00

The final numerical answer is:
$3.00"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much as the first pack, which is:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount Tim spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. For 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are both dangerous (99% of the candles) and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog (5% of the dangerous candles).

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 99\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.99 \times 50000 = 49500 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 49500 = 0.05 \times 49500 = 2475 \text{ candles} \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ 2475 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2475 \]"
"First, let's find out the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there's a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price for each blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Joanne gathered:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: half of 30, which is 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Determine the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered:**
   - From the tallest trees: twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \).
   - Her sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 150 + x \).

4. **Set up the equation based on the total number of apples gathered:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To find out the total distance Tom traveled, we need to break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = 4 days * 200 km/day = 800 km.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

3. **The next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 7 days * 300 km/day = 2100 km.

Now, we add up all the distances from each segment to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip.

- Total distance = Distance for the first 4 days + Distance for the next 2 days + Distance for the next day + Distance for the second week
- Total distance = 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, if we let the size of Zack's locker be \( Z \), then:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}Z = 5
   \]
3. To find \( Z \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   Z = 5 \times 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.
4. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. If we let the size of Timothy's locker be \( T \), then:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}T = 20
   \]
5. To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   T = 20 \times 2 = 40

"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver was at 3,000 feet. To find the comb, Oliver needs to climb to 6,000 feet from 3,000 feet, which means Oliver needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The final numerical answer is 3,000 feet."
"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000. So, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks. We add the amounts from the first and second banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total capital Mr. Josue has now. He initially had $5000 in capital. Adding the $12000 he received from the banks to his initial capital gives:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:

"First, let's calculate how many cats were taken away by the boats. Four boats carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats taken away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the original number of cats:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. So, we calculate 3/5 of the 30 remaining cats:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

We then subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the cost into different periods:

1. **First 6 months**: The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 12 months (months 9 to 20)**: The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 12 months = 12 months * $14/month = $168.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $168 (next 12 months) = $240.

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $240."
"First, let's find out the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of both jeans before the sale. The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:

\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 and the original cost of the tattered jeans was $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses.
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses.
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans.
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total capacity:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."

"First, let's find out the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of cake} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny gets $50 in spending cash after selling his cards.
   - The ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards is $50 (spending cash) + $100 (ticket cost) = $150.

2. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he has by the price per card: $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards.
   - This means he sold 2/3 of his cards.
   - If 2/3 of his cards is equal to 100 cards, we can find the total number of cards he started with by setting up the equation: (2/3) * total cards = 100.
   - Solving for total cards, we get: total cards = 100 * (3/2) = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total cost.

20% of $165.00 is:
0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, 120 cents is equal to 1.20 dollars. So, George spent 1.20 dollars on chips.

Next, we know that George spent a total of 5 dollars and had 1% of his money left. This means that the 1% of his money left is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since 1% of his money is 3.80 dollars, we can find out how much money he had initially by recognizing that 3.80 dollars is 1% of his total money. Therefore, his initial amount of money is:

\[ 3.80 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 380 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know that George spent 1.20 dollars on chips and had 3.80 dollars left, so the total amount of money he had initially is 5 dollars. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the chips and the remaining money:

\[ 1.20 \text{ dollars} + 3.80 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. Since George spent 1.20 dollars on chips, the remaining money he had to spend on candy bars is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Converting 3.80 dollars to cents, we get:

\[ 3.80 \text{ dollars} = 380 \text{ cents} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{380 \text{ cents}}{75 \text{ cents per candy bar}} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, we take the integer part of the division, which is 5. Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of his friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory cuts into pieces. The cake weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 pieces. So, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they together have:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \]

The weight of the pieces they have is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the pieces Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together.

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges equally among these 8 people. So, we divide 56 oranges by 8 people:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, we can calculate Bernadette's drive time as follows:

\[
\text{Bernadette's drive time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's drive time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes and Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, the difference in their travel times is:

\[
\text{Difference in travel times} = \text{Bernadette's drive time} - \text{Wayne's drive time} = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

To ensure Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 5 minutes earlier than the time Wayne leaves. Therefore, Bernadette should leave:

\[
\text{Bernadette's departure time} = \text{Wayne's departure time} - 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since Wayne's drive time is 4 minutes, Bernadette should leave:

\[
\text{Bernadette's departure time} = 4 - 5 = -1 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since leaving 1 minute before Wayne's departure time is not possible, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne's departure time to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 1 minute earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. We can find the width by using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 98 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. So, the total temperature increase is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature of 40 degrees, we get:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to account for the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the total cooling is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this cooling from the temperature after the oven was on, we get:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"First, let's convert all the times Jon took to complete the triathlon into minutes for easier calculation:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, the total time Jon took is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the times for James. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

The time for the run remains the same as Jon's, which is 50 minutes.

So, the total time James took is:
\[ 36 + 85 + 50 = 171 \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won the race by 10 minutes, which means James took 10 minutes more than Jon. We can verify this:
\[ 171 - 170 = 1 \text{ minute} \]

There seems to be a discrepancy since the problem states Jon won by 10 minutes. Let's recheck the problem statement and calculations. The problem states Jon won by 10 minutes, so we need to adjust the times accordingly. Let's assume the problem meant James took 10 minutes more than Jon, which means James's total time should be:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took James to run. We know the total time James took is 180 minutes, and the times for the swim and bike are 36 minutes and 85 minutes respectively. So, the time for the run is:
\[ 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we can find the length of Movie B by adding 5 minutes to the length of Movie C:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour, in 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bails of hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Bails of hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails of hay} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's find out how many eggs Rozanne has in total.

She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs would be:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

She also has 2 loose eggs. So, the total number of eggs she has is:
\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

Joey's initial points: 214
Points scored by Joey: 26

Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points scored by Marcy: 10

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is now winning:

Joey's new score: 240
Marcy's new score: 235

The difference in their scores is:

240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ \text{Remaining sneakers} = 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from the 31 sneakers sold to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from 31 sneakers} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from all the sneakers sold:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find out the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each have eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces per packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces per packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's break down the costs for both options:

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

We know that you saved $2 by choosing the regular ticket option. So, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $4.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the cost of filling one balloon on the first day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon was:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 \]

To calculate \(170 \times 65\), we can break it down:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]

\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid:

\[ \$11050 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:

1. For the first part of the trip, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part of the trip, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, let's add the distances to get the total distance:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after trading 3 sapphires for two rubies. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies Jenna received in the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and each sapphire is worth $800, so the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the 2 rubies she received are worth $1200 each, the total value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels (5 sapphires and 2 rubies) is:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many apples one person eats in 30 days. Since each person eats 4 apples a day, in 30 days, one person will eat:
   \[
   4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. Since both Marin and Nancy eat the same amount, we need to find out how many apples both of them eat together in 30 days. So, we multiply the number of apples one person eats in 30 days by 2:
   \[
   120 \text{ apples/person} \times 2 \text{ people} = 240 \text{ apples}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of apples that Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days is 240."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. We know that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. Since there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Now, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   So, 25 fairies came from the east and joined the fairies that were already there.
3. Now, we need to find out how many fairies there are after the 25 new fairies join the original 50 fairies:
   \[
   50 + 25 = 75
   \]
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, we subtract 30 from the 75 fairies:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45
   \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Find the percentage of puppies with spots.

First, let's find the total number of puppies:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
- Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies with spots:
- Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
- Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
- Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:
- Percentage of puppies with spots = (Number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100
- Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 0.35 * 100 = 35%.

So, the final numerical answer is 35%."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer buys:

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - He buys 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - He buys 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - He buys 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - He buys 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats)
- Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since even a fraction of a trip counts as a full trip):

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2

Since 4500 divided by 2250 is exactly 2, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:
2 trips"
"First, let's determine how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles in one week.

1. **Cans of soda:**
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda a week.
   - Therefore, the value of the cans she drinks in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents per can} = 6 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Plastic bottles of water:**
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week.
   - Therefore, the value of the bottles she drinks in a week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents per bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Total earnings in one week:**
   - Adding the earnings from cans and bottles:
     \[
     6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}
     \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Grayson earns in a four-week month.

4. **Total earnings in four weeks:**
   - Since she earns 21 cents per week, for four weeks:
     \[
     21 \text{ cents per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
     \]

So, the total amount Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month is:
\[
\boxed{84}

"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 9."

"To find out the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip and then add it to the original cost of the pizza.

First, let's find out the tip. The tip is 1/5 of the amount she ordered. The pizza costs $15, so the tip is:

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the original cost of the pizza to get the total amount Ashley should give:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

So, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Finley started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots. So, she moved to 1st - 5 = -4th place. Since she can't be in negative place, this means she moved to 6th place (because 1st - 5 = 6th).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots. So, she moved to 6th + 2 = 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots. So, she moved to 8th - 3 = 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot. So, she moved to 5th + 1 = 6th place.

Finley finished the race in 6th place.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we need to find out how many cards she gives to her students. We subtract the 50 cards she keeps from the total number of cards:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria gives these 300 cards to her students, and each student receives 10 cards. To find out how many students she has, we divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10 percent of 10 dollars:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the final cost for Kelly is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky. We subtract Becky's total cost from Kelly's total cost:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: There are twice as many pillow cases as sheets. So, for each room, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: There are twice as many towels as pillow cases. So, for each room, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total pieces of laundry per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

"First, let's calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank gains over the days mentioned:

- On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gains \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
- On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
- On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

Now, let's add up all the shoes he gains:
\[10 + 30 + 60 = 100\]

Initially, he has 200 shoes. After gaining 100 more shoes, the total number of shoes he has is:
\[200 + 100 = 300\]

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, we subtract 180 from the total number of shoes he had after gaining the shoes:
\[300 - 180 = 120\]

Therefore, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils the class started with. Since there are 30 students and each student had 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. Let's check the calculation:
\[ \frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches/remora} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches (the combined length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches).

The formula to find the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = \frac{1}{10} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10\% \]"

We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This principle helps us avoid counting the same kids more than once when we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number allergic to peanuts.

First, let's identify the numbers given:
- Number of kids allergic to dairy: 9
- Number of kids allergic to peanuts: 6
- Number of kids allergic to both: 3

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. According to the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts or both} = (\text{Number of kids allergic to dairy}) + (\text{Number of kids allergic to peanuts}) - (\text{Number of kids allergic to both}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts or both} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Now, we know there are 32 kids in total. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids:

\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = \text{Total number of kids} - \text{Number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts or both} \]

\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20."

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts.

Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs will cost:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Heather has a $2.00 coupon, so the cost after applying the coupon is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Heather is buying 2 packs of razors, and each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.75 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.75 \times 100 = 75 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. To find the average height, we add up all the heights and divide by the total number of cheerleaders.

The total height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall is:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the height of the 10th cheerleader:
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we divide the total height by the number of cheerleaders to find the average height:
\[ \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height of the human pyramid. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top. The shortest girl is at the top, so her height is 60 inches.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the girls:
\[ 60 + 63.6 + 63.6 + 63.6 + 63.6 = 60 + 5 \times 63.6 = 60 + 318 = 378 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
\[ \frac{378}{12} = 31.5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ \boxed{31.5} \]"
"Charisma works for 8 hours every day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes she works in a day as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. So, in one day, she walks for:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2400 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days at the office, the total minutes she has walked is:

\[ 2400 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12000 minutes."
"First, let's determine Brett's age in four years. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, in four years he will be:

\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times his current age is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract four years from her age in four years:

\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old} \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 38 \]"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to calculate the cost of his morning rides and his afternoon rides separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

So, the total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

So, the total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add up all the oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges (Ashley)} + 70 \text{ oranges (Brianne)} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie needs three oranges, so to find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then find the number of guests for which these costs are equal.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- The flat fee is $200.
- The cost of food for each guest is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n
  \]

**Cost at the second venue:**
- The cost per person is $25.
- The cost of food for each guest is already included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:
  \[
  \text{Cost}_2 = 25n
  \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs at both venues are equal. So, we set the two costs equal to each other:
\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides to isolate the terms with \( n \) on one side:
   \[
   200 = 25n - 5n
   \]
   \[
   200 = 20n
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{200}{20}
   \]
   \[
   n = 10
   \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Also, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can calculate the number of insects Lily found as:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of a skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we need to add these fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. So, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Next, we need to convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein into yards. We know that there are 364 yards in a skein. To find out how many yards are in \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein, we multiply 364 by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
364 \times \frac{3}{4} = 364 \times 0.75 = 273
\]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends.

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Now, add the gifts for her friends together:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts as a surprise. So, we add these to the total:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:
\[26\]"
"First, let's find the width of the rug. The problem states that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Since the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We already know the width of the rug is 8 feet, so we can calculate twice the width of the rug:

Twice the width of the rug = 2 * 8 feet
Twice the width of the rug = 16 feet

Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

Length of the couch = Twice the width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
- Two packs were strawberry flavored.
- One pack was grape flavored, costing $2.
- One pack was green apple flavored, costing half as much as the grape pack, so $2 / 2 = $1.
- The total cost of all the gum was $7.

We need to find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2x \).

The total cost for all the gum is the sum of the cost of the strawberry gum and the grape gum:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[ \text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 4} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

For 2 x 8 pieces:
\[ \text{Total sticks from 2 x 8} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 4 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs Mario's 6 sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes. Each pair costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's determine the number of bus trips Janet takes in a week. She takes two bus trips each day and she does this five days a week:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass. Each bus trip costs $2.20, so:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

The final numerical answer is 120."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information given.

First, we know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, we can write the following equations based on the quantities Rose bought:

\[ 4 \times S_o = 12 \]
\[ 4 \times S_p = 4 \]

Now, we solve these equations to find \( S_o \) and \( S_p \).

For the onions:
\[ 4 \times S_o = 12 \]
\[ S_o = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ S_o = 3 \]

For the potatoes:
\[ 4 \times S_p = 4 \]
\[ S_p = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ S_p = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the quantities together:
\[ S_o + S_p = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds and then figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day to achieve this goal.

First, we calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories per pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days Andy has until his birthday. Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from January 1st to February 28th is 31 + 28 = 59 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 30th is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these days together:
\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to reach his goal of burning 105,000 calories in 190 days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} = 552.63 \text{ calories per day} \]

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to find out the total distance Hannah will run. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, we calculate the total distance as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 km, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ \text{Total water needed} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = \$100 \]

So, after buying clothes, the remaining money is:

\[ \$500 - \$100 = \$400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = \$100 \]

So, after buying CDs, the remaining money is:

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$300 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

So, Tara earned a profit of $288."

\[ \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies Josh made. So:

\[ \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. So, the amount he gives to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount he uses for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the quarts each person can pick per hour to find the total:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

\[
\boxed{29}

"First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold and returned:

- Sold in the morning: 93 loaves
- Sold in the afternoon: 39 loaves
- Returned by the grocery store: 6 loaves

Total sold and returned = 93 + 39 + 6 = 138 loaves

Now, we start with the initial number of loaves baked:

- Initial loaves baked: 200 loaves

To find out how many loaves are left, we subtract the total sold and returned from the initial number:

- Loaves left = Initial loaves - Total sold and returned
- Loaves left = 200 - 138 = 62 loaves

So, the final number of loaves of bread left is 62."
"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of red tulips is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we need to determine how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of blue tulips is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much raisins Heather will have for each of the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix). Since she wants to divide the bag of raisins equally among the three items, we divide the total amount of raisins by 3.

The total amount of raisins is 27 cups. So, we divide 27 by 3:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

This means Heather will have 9 cups of raisins for each of the three items. Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the 9 cups of raisins by 3/4 of a cup:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

**Before adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost before:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$18.00 \]

**After adding the new device:**
- Daily consumption: 12 kW/h + 2 kW/h = 14 kW/h
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost after:
\[ 14 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$21.00 \]

Next, we calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios.

**Weekly cost before adding the new device:**
\[ \$18.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$126.00 \]

**Weekly cost after adding the new device:**
\[ \$21.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$147.00 \]

Finally, we find the difference between the weekly costs:
\[ \$147.00 - \$126.00 = \$21.00 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21.00."
"First, let's determine how much work one person does in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, that person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

So, one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Now, if we have 5 people working together, the amount of work they can do in one day is:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[
\frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we need to convert these days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is:

\[
2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. The final numerical answer is:

\[
48

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \( C_O = 20 + 2 = 22 \).
   - So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

2. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).
   - Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
   - According to the problem, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).
   - So, Jenna has 64 sofas.

3. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.
   - The total number of sofas is \( 20 + 64 = 84 \).
   - The total number of chairs is \( 22 + 66 = 88 \).
   - Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could have bought with that money.

First, we know that Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4, so the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]
So, the headphone set costs $44.

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]
So, he would have $4 left.

Now, we need to find out how many CDs he could buy with $4. Since each CD costs $4, he could buy:
\[ 4 \div 4 = 1 \]
So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had not bought the headphone set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the different hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours from the different weeks:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 80\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(80 - 21 + 7 = 66\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 27 + 8 = 35 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 35 = 70 \).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \( 70 - 5 = 65 \) years old in 8 years.

3. **Determine Jame's cousin's current age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, then his current age is \( 65 - 8 = 57 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - Jame's cousin is currently 57 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 57 - 22 = 35 \) years.

So, the final numerical answer is 35 years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400. We also know the cost of the computer is $1,100. Let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \) and the cost of the printer as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
2. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer, so \( P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \).

Now we can write the equation for the total cost:
\[ \text{Cost of computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of monitor} + \text{Cost of printer} = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
To find \( 2M \), we subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Now, we solve for \( M \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 600 \text{ seashells} = 600 \text{ seashells} + 2400 \text{ seashells} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ seashells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ seashells/girl} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"

"First, let's find out how old Alyana is. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can find Anne's age by adding 2 years to Alyana's age:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then add them together.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:

\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:

First, add 31 and 50:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and use some basic arithmetic.

First, let's determine the total number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. So, we need to find out how many days are in each half of the month.

The first half of April has 15 days (1st to 15th), and the second half has 15 days (16th to 30th).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves daily in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves daily in the second half of the month will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of the month will be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of the month will be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total savings for the entire month will be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 daily in the first half of the month. In the second half of the month, he saves twice as much daily, which is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Alphabet Length**: The English alphabet has 26 letters.

2. **First Two Times Writing the Alphabet**: Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. So, she writes:
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Writing Half of the Alphabet**: Elise writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 letters is:

"First, let's determine how many toys James's play set needs to be five times larger than his current 80 toys.

James's play set has 80 toys. If we want a play set five times larger, we calculate:
\[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

So, James's play set needs 400 toys to be five times larger.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set needs 400 toys, Jonathan needs:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} \]

Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{398} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy without the discount:

- One notebook costs $1.50, so five notebooks cost \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).
- One pen costs $0.25, so two pens cost \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\).
- One calculator costs $12.
- One geometry set costs $10.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means Daniel will only pay 90% of the total cost. So, we calculate 90% of $20.00:
\[20.00 \times 0.90 = 18.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1500 \times 0.30 = 450 \]

3. Additional commission on the amount over $1000 ($1500):
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to get Antonella's total earnings:
\[ 300 + 450 + 150 = 900 \]

So, Antonella earned $900.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 900 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bill currently has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles.

\[ \text{Total bottles Bill has} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill needs for his 70 guests. He wants to have 2 bottles per guest.

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 70 \times 2 = 140 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy by subtracting the number of bottles he already has from the number of bottles he needs.

\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 140 - 48 = 92 \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 92 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when it's cold. So, we calculate twice the time it takes in cold water and then add 2 minutes:

\[ 2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile when the water is warm.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water conditions.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes per mile} = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:

\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, let's find out how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We can do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, let's determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. The foot-long fish sub costs $40, and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much. So, we calculate the cost of the cold-cut combo sub as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of cold-cut combo sub} = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"First, let's find out how many buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes, the rest had four holes.

So, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes. There are 7 buttons with two holes each, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

There are 14 buttons with four holes each, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes in all the buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, and Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can calculate Peter's locker size as follows:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, if the daily recommended cups of coffee is \( x \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{x}{2} = 5x \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, Juan's coffee intake should be reduced to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5x \) cups to 4 cups.

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract the recommended daily intake from Juan's current intake:
\[ 5x - 4 \]

Since \( x \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, we need to know the value of \( x \) to find the exact number of cups Juan must reduce. However, the problem does not provide the value of \( x \). Instead, it asks for the reduction in terms of the recommended daily intake.

Given that Juan's current intake is \( 5x \) and the recommended intake is 4 cups, the reduction in cups is:
\[ 5x - 4 \]

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of \( x \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( x \). But if we assume the daily recommended intake \( x \) is 4 cups (which would make the problem simpler and consistent with the doctor's recommendation), then:
\[ 5 \times 4 - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together to get the total number of rodents:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight, we add up their weights and divide by the number of friends (which is 3):

\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the angle of the sun changes over time and how it relates to the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Change of the Sun's Angle**: The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid every hour.

3. **Time Duration**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Change in the Sun's Angle**: Since the sun moves 5 degrees upward every hour, in 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground will be the initial angle plus the total change in angle:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
82"
"First, let's determine the ages of James' sons. We know one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger. So, the second son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he needs a candle for each son, he needs:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of candles he needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, James spends:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Judy read in the first week and the second week, and then add those numbers together.

First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total minutes she read in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in one minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of minutes she read by the number of pages she reads per minute:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

We are also given that in the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Now, let's add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Shiloh's age in 7 years:**
   - Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
   - In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for his nephew's age in 7 years:**
   - Let \( x \) be the nephew's current age.
   - In 7 years, the nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: \( 51 = 3(x + 7) \).

3. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - First, distribute the 3 on the right side: \( 51 = 3x + 21 \).
   - Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \): \( 51 - 21 = 3x \).
   - Simplify: \( 30 = 3x \).
   - Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \): \( x = 10 \).

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

**Final numerical answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - So, for three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of these teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - The amount per tooth for the first three teeth was $1.00.
   - Therefore, for the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth.
   - So, for two teeth, the tooth fairy gave $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the money given by the tooth fairy:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total money given by the tooth fairy:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many goals each teenager scored and then sum them up.

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
2. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. The problem also states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. So, the total amount Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate:

\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he spends money on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for wooden action figures is:

\[ \text{Cost of wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining money Peter has is:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 29 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the spaying procedure:
- Spaying cost: $200

- Total cost = $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

So, the total cost for Leah's kitten so far is $308."
"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses per week, but the flower shops order 65 roses per week. This means Ford lacks:
65 - 40 = 25 roses per week.

To find out how many roses he lacks in a month, we need to multiply the weekly shortage by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks:
25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses/month.

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much money Katina will have left in her account after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:

Next, we calculate the total amount of money she removes from her account over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times \$100/\text{month} = \$2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[ \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

So, the amount of money remaining in her account after 2 years is:
\[ \$600 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$600 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ingredients for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 per loaf, and since 10 sandwiches are made from 1 loaf, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for ingredients for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ 3.00 + 30.00 = 33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches. They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:
\[ 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 70.00 - 33.00 = 37.00 \]

So, the net profit is $37.00."

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
- Cost of new carpet: $12 per square foot
- Cost of padding: $2 per square foot
- Total cost per square foot for new carpet and padding: $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot

So, the total cost for the new carpet and padding is:
\[ \text{Total cost for carpet and padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times 14 \text{ dollars per square foot} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
- Cost of removing the old carpet: $4 per square foot
- Total cost for removing the old carpet: \( 216 \text{ square feet} \times 4 \text{ dollars per square foot} = 864 \text{ dollars} \)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. We can denote this as \( x = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: This operation involves adding half of the starting value to the starting value and then dividing the result by 5.
   - Half of the starting value is \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - Adding this to the starting value gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Dividing this result by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

3. **Second Operation**: This operation involves multiplying the result of the first operation by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiplying the result of the first operation by this value gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

So, the final value of the number train is 48.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to determine the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting.

Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would give an actual temperature of 520 degrees, knowing that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( x \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be:
\[ x - 0.04x = 0.96x \]

We know that the actual temperature should be 520 degrees:
\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ x = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 541.67 \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the lengths of the two movies together.

First movie length: 1 hour and 30 minutes
Second movie length: 2 hours and 5 minutes

We can convert these times into just minutes to make the addition easier.

1 hour = 60 minutes
So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the lengths of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than $76,000. This can be done by finding 30% of $76,000 and then subtracting that amount from $76,000.

First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Now, subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Next, we need to find the combined value of both houses:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen means 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. At the event, her friend brought 40 cups.
4. Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy's friend brought 20 dishes, this means Judy's friend brought \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend:

- Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes.
- Her friend brought 40 cups and 40 dishes.

To find the total number of cups and dishes brought by both, we add the cups and dishes together:

- Total cups: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes: \(24 + 40 = 64\)

Now, we add the total number of cups and dishes to get the total number of utensils:

- Total utensils: \(52 + 64 = 116\)

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 116."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it is currently 10% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

Therefore, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, Pete is buying 2 boxes of contacts. The total cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets with 2 boxes. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

So, Pete will have 180 pairs of contacts. To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jill earned.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Since Tabitha agreed to pay $10 an hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much John earned.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

John also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Since Tabitha agreed to pay $10 an hour, John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how many 200 calorie units are in 1600 calories:
- Number of 200 calorie units in 1600 calories = 1600 calories / 200 calories/unit = 8 units.

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:
- Total water needed = 8 units * 100 ml/unit = 800 ml.

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's list out the three typing speeds Jared has measured:

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. After some lessons: 52 WPM
3. After increasing by 5 words: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds. The formula for the average of three numbers is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the numbers}}{\text{Number of values}}
\]

So, we calculate the sum of the three speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
47 + 52 = 99
\]
\[
99 + 57 = 156
\]

Now, we divide the sum by the number of values (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over that period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\).

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\).

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- The difference is \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}\).

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people Alex will have at the event, including the initial invitees, their friends, and the friends' spouses.

1. **Initial Invitees:**
   Alex invites 100 people.

2. **Friends Invited by Initial Invitees:**
   Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 friends.
   \[
   100 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ friends per person} = 200 \text{ friends}
   \]

3. **Friends Invited by Alex's Friends:**
   Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of them bring their spouses.
   - 8 friends bring spouses.
   - 10 friends in total (8 with spouses + 2 without spouses).

4. **Total People at the Event:**
   - Initial invitees: 100
   - Friends invited by initial invitees: 200
   - Friends invited by Alex's friends: 10 (Alex's friends) + 8 (spouses) = 18

"First, let's determine the weight of each dog step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighs \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs \( 5 \times 44 = 220 \) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

So, the total cost on Amazon is:
\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay.

The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total cost on eBay is:
\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon.

The difference in cost is:
\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than Mark's window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

- Day 0: The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- Day 1: The beanstalk doubles to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet.
- Day 2: The beanstalk doubles to \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet.
- Day 3: The beanstalk doubles to \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet.

We can see that on Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet of Mark's window.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. First, we need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, we can calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \frac{3 \times 200}{100} = \frac{600}{100} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
   \]
   So, 200 grams of mushrooms contain 6 grams of protein.

2. Next, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, in a week (7 days) he will eat:
   \[
   200 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1400 \text{ grams/week}
   \]
   And the protein content in 1400 grams of mushrooms is:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 1400 grams} = \left(\frac{6 \text{ grams of protein}}{200 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 1400 \text{ grams of mushrooms}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{Protein in 1400 grams} = \frac{6 \times 1400}{200} = \frac{8400}{200} = 42 \text{ grams of protein}
   \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, expand the right side of the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( J \). Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]

Now, multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. So, the cost for the two implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine how many gumballs Colby can buy based on the value of his coins.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
   \[
   8 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
   \[
   6 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[
   14 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ cents/nickel} = 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[
   15 \text{ pennies} \times 1 \text{ cent/penny} = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total value of all the coins Colby has:
\[
200 \text{ cents} + 60 \text{ cents} + 70 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 345 \text{ cents}
\]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total value of his coins by the cost of one gumball:
\[
\frac{345 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/gumball}} = 69 \text{ gumballs}
\]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Distance to be traveled = 2000 miles
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, the additional hours required to travel the additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.

"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the rate as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate Marissa's rate as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates they make together in one hour. We add Ruiz's and Marissa's rates:

\[ \text{Total rate} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} + 45 \text{ pounds per hour} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each part of the time he worked and then add them together.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

So, the earnings for the first four hours are:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

So, the earnings for the next two hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

"First, let's find out how many times the tires rotate in total for Jeremy's monthly driving.

Given:
- The car drives 400 miles a month.
- For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.

To find out how many rotations the tires make for 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Rotations for 400 miles} = 400 \text{ miles} \times \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of rotations for 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations for 400 miles} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Next, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced. We need to find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} \]

Let's calculate the number of months:
\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years this is:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

"First, let's determine how many washes Jackie can get from one pump of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps give 120 washes. So, 1 pump will give:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Now, we know that the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00. We need to find out how many pumps are in the bottle. Since 1 pump gives 60 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{1 \text{ pump}} = 24 \text{ pumps} \]

Now, we need to find out the cost of each pump. Since the bottle costs $24.00 and there are 24 pumps in the bottle, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pumps}} = 1 \text{ dollar per pump} \]

Since we need the answer in cents, we convert $1 to cents:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost of each pump is:

\[ 100 \text{ cents} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% off sale.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discount on the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35 and there is a 30% off sale.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the shorts will cost:
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. To find out how much money he will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Juan will need to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

First, we know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, for 4 dozen croissants, we need to multiply the amount of butter by 4:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \text{ pound} \times 4 = 1 \text{ pound}
\]

This means Juan needs 1 pound of butter to make 4 dozen croissants in one day. Now, we need to find out how much butter he will need for a week (7 days):

\[
1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final numerical answer is:
7"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street individually and then find the difference.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194 \text{ per meter} = \$94,660 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \$94,660 - \$29,100 = \$65,560 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$65,560 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.

2. **Total Time for Research:**
   The research ends up taking 10 times the initial 5 months.
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   The first 5 months cost $100,000.

4. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   The remaining months are:
   \[
   50 \text{ months} - 5 \text{ months} = 45 \text{ months}
   \]
   Each of these 45 months costs 50% more than the initial $100,000 per month.
   \[
   \text{Increased funding per month} = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
   \]

5. **Total Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   The total cost for the 45 months is:
   \[
   45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000
   \]

6. **Total Cost of the Research:**
   Adding the initial funding to the cost of the remaining months:
   \[
   100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000
   \]

So, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{6850000}

"To find out how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat consumed by each player.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. So, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not eat any meat.

Now, we add up the meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of posts in March. We know that March has 31 days. If each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 times per day, we can find the total number of posts by multiplying the number of members by the average number of posts per member per day and then by the number of days in March.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} \times 31 \text{ days} \]

Let's do the math:
\[ 1000 \times 3 = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]
\[ 3000 \times 31 = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.**

Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
\[ \text{Total loads in a year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total gallons of water used in a year.**

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
\[ \text{Total gallons of water} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.**

A gallon of water costs $0.15.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the rocks:
Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each.
\[ 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral:
Scarlett bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each.
\[ 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the fish:
Scarlett bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \]

The cost of the fish food is given as:

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row.

\[
\text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
\]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

\[
\text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
\]

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left.

\[
\text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54
\]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents.

\[
\text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
\]

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were occupied by the students.

\[
\text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36
\]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[
\boxed{36}

"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of street lights for all 4 intersections. Since each intersection has 24 street lights, the total number of street lights for 4 intersections is:

\[ 4 \text{ intersections} \times 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

We are given that 20 street lights are not working. Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has already been played to their maximum play counts.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times. So, the remaining number of plays for the first DVD is:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times. So, the remaining number of plays for the second DVD is:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \]

Now, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs to find the total number of plays they can be played before they break:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To find out the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of therapy sessions John had:**
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
   - So, each week he had \(2 \times 2 = 4\) sessions.
   - Over 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

2. **Calculate the total time John spent in therapy:**
   - Each session is 2 hours long.
   - So, the total time spent in therapy is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the therapy:**

"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school and a school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews during school as follows:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we account for the pieces he chews on the way home from school and after dinner:

\[
1 \text{ piece on the way home} + 1 \text{ piece after dinner} = 2 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the total number of pieces Jim chews during the day is:

\[
4 \text{ pieces during school} + 2 \text{ pieces after school} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Initially, Jim has a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Then, Jim gives half of the remaining pieces to his sister right before bed:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, the number of pieces Jim has left after giving half to his sister is:

\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[
\boxed{7}

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/h."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of cars towed on the first three days. According to the problem, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, we calculate the total for these three days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cars were towed on the remaining days of the week. The problem states that the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day on the remaining days compared to the first three days. Since there are 7 days in a week, the remaining days are the last 4 days. On these days, the tow truck pulled:

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cars towed on the last 4 days:

\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the last four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:

\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Adam's current height in feet is:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. So, Adam needs to grow:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide the required growth by his yearly growth rate:
\[ \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \text{ per car} = \$250,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire these cars. The company paid 30% of the price:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we need to find out the profit James made. The profit is the total sales minus the cost the company paid:

\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. We know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 0.6 \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

Since the rest of the riders who can stay upright are men, we can find the number of men by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.

\[ \text{Number of men} = 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that a diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. So, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we have the prices of all three jewels:
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $1600
- Silver jewel: $1200

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together:

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find out the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's find out the cost per class if Manny misses some classes. If the total cost is $60 for 10 classes, then the cost per class is:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Now, we know that if the cost per class exceeds $10, Manny's parents won't sign him up again. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will still sign him up for the classes.

However, the question asks how many classes Manny can miss before they don't sign him up again. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can miss any number of classes and still be within the $10 per class limit. But the question seems to imply that they will not sign him up if the cost per class exceeds $10, which is not the case here.

So, Manny can miss any number of classes and still be within the $10 per class limit. But if we interpret the question as asking how many classes he can miss before the total cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's assume Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he will have \( 10 - x \) classes left. The total cost remains $60, so the cost per class becomes:

\[ \text{New cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this new cost per class to be greater than $10:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} > 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x \) must be positive, so \( x < 10 \)):

\[ 60 > 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 > 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x > 40 \]
\[ x > 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is 4.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week.

First, let's find out how many customers Jewel processes in a day. According to the problem, Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, we can calculate how many customers Julie processes in a day. If Jewel processes 50 customers, then Julie processes:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

For Jewel:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

For Julie:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

Now, we add the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Reggie ran. We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if we let \( L \) be the number of miles Lynn ran, then:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3 \]

Since we already know Reggie's distance is 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

For oranges:
- Three oranges cost $3.30.
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $12.00."

- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:
\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to dig the hole, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to dig one cubic foot:
\[ \text{Time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 216 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total extra cost = $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Now, we add the base price of the truck to the total extra cost:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- Total extra cost: $13,500

Total cost = $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we need to calculate his new monthly salary after the raise and bonus, and then multiply that by 12 (months in a year).

First, let's calculate the raise:
- Tim's original monthly salary is $20000.
- The raise is 5% of $20000.
- 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
- $20000 + $1000 = $21000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus:
- The bonus is half a month's salary.
- Half of $20000 = $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So, his total monthly salary after the raise and bonus is:
- $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly salary by 12:
- $31000 * 12 = $372000.

So, the final numerical answer is $372000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's find the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. Since a suit costs $750, the cost of a pair of dress pants is:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits. So, the total number of dress shirts he buys is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of articles the news website publishes in February:
- The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of articles the sister company publishes in February:
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:

"First, let's determine the ages of Steve's family members.

Steve is 60 years old.

His wife is 4 years older than him, so:
\[ 60 + 4 = 64 \]
So, Steve's wife is 64 years old.

Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so:
\[ \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]
So, Steve's son is 32 years old.

Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so if we let the age of their son's husband be \( x \), then:
\[ x - 3 \]
Since we don't have the exact age of their son's husband, we can't determine it directly, but we know the age of their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. Since we are only asked for the age of their son's wife, and we don't have the exact age of their son's husband, we can't provide a numerical answer for the son's wife's age based on the information given. However, if we assume the question is asking for the age difference, the answer would be 3 years.

Since the question asks for the final numerical answer, and we don't have enough information to determine the exact age of their son's wife, we can only provide the age difference, which is 3 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much flour is in one bag.
2. Multiply the amount of flour in one bag by three to get the total amount of flour in three bags.

First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, to find out how much flour is in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

"First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Speed} = 12 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked. Using the same formula:

For Stanley:
\[ \text{Speed} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 \]

Now, let's calculate these distances.
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, to find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we add the distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil and the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time for soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time for clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time for the soil and the time for the clay to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for soil} + \text{Time for clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."

First, let's identify the total number of people:
- Howie
- His teacher
- 25 classmates

So, the total number of people is:
\[ 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 \]

Howie wants to get one vanilla cupcake and one chocolate cupcake for each person. Therefore, he needs to buy:
- 27 vanilla cupcakes
- 27 chocolate cupcakes

To find the total number of cupcakes, we add the vanilla and chocolate cupcakes together:
\[ 27 + 27 = 54 \]

Thus, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Fishio received 2000 likes after 1 week.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
3. She received 20000 more new likes recently.

Let's calculate the number of likes three weeks after the initial 2000 likes:

Initial likes = 2000
Likes after 3 weeks = 70 * initial likes
Likes after 3 weeks = 70 * 2000
Likes after 3 weeks = 140000

Now, we add the 20000 new likes she received recently:

Total likes = Likes after 3 weeks + 20000
Total likes = 140000 + 20000
Total likes = 160000

So, the final numerical answer is 160000 likes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats were twice the sales from red hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month = $400 * 2 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = $1200 * 3/4 = $900.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
   - Total sales in two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the time James hires the carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, he pays for 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour.

So, the cost for the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30.
The cost for the third hour is also $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's add up the costs for the 3 hours he pays for:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the amount she actually has in her bank account.

First, let's find out how much Sally earned this week. She started with $200 and now has $420. So, the amount she earned this week is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her weekly wage from the amount she earned:
\[ 220 - 300 = -80 \]

Since the result is negative, it means that the amount withheld is $80. Therefore, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, we can calculate the total number of deviled egg halves as follows:

\[
16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. We know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. Therefore, we can calculate the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
\]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we can find the number of dozens by dividing the total number of whole eggs by 12:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen}
\]

So, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

The number of days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading is:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel. The cost to rent the hanger is $5000 per month. The cost for fuel is twice that, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Now, let's add the cost of renting the hanger and the cost of fuel to find the total monthly cost:
$5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Now, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total yearly cost of renting and maintaining it:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (rent and maintenance) = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

1. **Rice**: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. So, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we need to find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is half of this combined time:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the items:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is:

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 3 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. So, we can write the following equations:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

"First, we need to find out how many history teachers there are. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find this number, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120.

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia: $120
- Kassidy: $90
- Rayna: $150

To find out how much money they would have if they added together their money and shared it equally, we first need to find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they share this total equally among the three of them, each person would get:

"First, let's find out the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds.
Cindy has 5 pounds.
Aaron has 4 pounds.

To find the total, we add these amounts together:
\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, they want to share this total amount of candy equally among the three of them. To find out how much candy each person will get, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each type A candy costs $0.5. So, the cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Adam bought 10 candies of type B, and each type B candy costs $0.75. So, the cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of type A candies and type B candies to find the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Christina recorded her moods over 30 days. We are given the following information:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

We can calculate the number of neutral days by subtracting the number of good and bad days from the total number of days:
\[ \text{Total days} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Good days} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Bad days} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Neutral days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]

Next, we are told the distribution of moods over the first 24 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

So, the number of good days in the first 24 days is:
\[ \text{Good days in first 24 days} = 8 \]

The number of bad days in the first 24 days is:
\[ \text{Bad days in first 24 days} = 8 \]

The number of neutral days in the first 24 days is:
\[ \text{Neutral days in first 24 days} = 10 \]

Now, we are given the distribution of the last 6 days:
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

So, the number of good days in the last 6 days is:
\[ \text{Good days in last 6 days} = 3 \]

The number of bad days in the last 6 days is:
\[ \text{Bad days in last 6 days} = 0 \]

The number of neutral days in the last 6 days is:
\[ \text{Neutral days in last 6 days} = 3 \]

To find the total number of good days in the month, we add the good days from the first 24 days and the good days from the last 6 days:
\[ \text{Total good days} = 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the current height in inches is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required for it to grow 360 inches is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's determine how many toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, each dog needs 1 toy. Now, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys. Therefore, he needs 4 (current toys) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 toys.

After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Since he left with 4 dogs and 8 more came in, he had 12 dogs in total when he left. Now, there are 12 * 2 = 24 more dogs in the shelter. So, he needs 24 more toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he can remove the 3 toys he bought last time. So, he needs 24 (toys for the new dogs) - 3 (toys for the dogs that left) = 21 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 12 (initial toys) + 21 (toys for the new dogs) = 33 toys.

The final numerical answer is 33."
"First, let's determine the total amount invested by Dylan. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total $1200.

\[
\text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
\]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Dylan's investment.

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
\]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[
\text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
\]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after Frances's investment.

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240
\]

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest of the remaining amount, which is $240.

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day if she works 3 hours. We do this by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We do this by multiplying her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns $120 in two days if she works 3 hours per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion because the number of potatoes and the number of hash browns are directly proportional.

Given: 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many hash browns can be made from 1 potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Now, add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
Total weight = Jack's weight + Weight of 8 adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding load = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, then Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, then the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, then Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they all have, we add up the cookies each person has:
\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[68 + 73 = 141\]
\[141 + 61 = 202\]
\[202 + 96 = 298\]

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298.

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \).

She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, the equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the times to minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of his lawn in each mode. So, he mows 30 minutes in ""turtle"" mode and 30 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, we add the times together:
- Time in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time in ""rabbit"" mode: 30 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 60 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now, we substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins (\( T \)):
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

"First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month. Rong saves 20 coins every month.

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{2 \times 20}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, the total number of coins Neil saves per month is:

\[
20 + 8 = 28
\]

Now, we need to find out how many coins each of them has after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 10 years is equivalent to:

\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have:

\[
20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he will have:

\[
28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

To find the total number of coins they have together after 10 years, we add the coins Rong has to the coins Neil has:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[ \text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.6T \).

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:

\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:

\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ \text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.

- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Since we already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, the total number of chairs we currently have is:
\[ 8 + 40 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs we currently have from the total number of chairs needed:

Next, we need to find out how many points Marta collected. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Since Betty has 65 points, Tom has:

\[ \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35 \]

So, Marta collected:

\[ \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

Now, we can add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, and Marta:

\[ \text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 105 = 220 \]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the number of points the class is missing is:

"First, let's determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can haul. We know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 \]
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, the total capacity of the three trucks can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we can solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received from the $100.

The total ratio is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Gerald's share is 3 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

Julia's share is 2 parts out of 5, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Next, we know that Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much money Gerald has left, we subtract the $10 he spent from his initial share:
\[ \text{Gerald's money left} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. So, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the firefighters have left to raise and then figure out how many more hours they need to raise that amount, assuming they raise an equal amount each hour.

1. **Determine the remaining amount to be raised:**
   - The goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount is:
     \[
     6300 - 2100 = 4200
     \]

2. **Assume they raise an equal amount each hour:**
   - They have already raised for 3 hours and raised $2100 in total.
   - To find out how much they raise per hour, we divide the total amount raised by the number of hours:
     \[
     \frac{2100}{3} = 700
     \]
   - So, they raise $700 per hour.

3. **Calculate the number of additional hours needed:**
   - They need to raise $4200 more.
   - Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:
     \[
     \frac{4200}{700} = 6
     \]

4. **Total hours needed:**
   - They have already raised for 3 hours.
   - They need to raise for an additional 6 hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours needed is:
     \[
     3 + 6 = 9
     \]

So, the total number of hours they have to fundraise to reach their goal is 9 hours.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage of the total river water used for industrial purposes by Colorado City is:
     \[
     40\% \times 80\% = 40\% \times 0.80 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - The percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 32%.
   - Therefore, the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the cost for one week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - So, the cost for one week is \( 7 \text{ days} \times $12 \text{ per day} = $84 \).

2. Calculate the cost for two weeks:
   - The cost for one week is $84.
   - For two weeks, the cost is \( 2 \times $84 = $168 \).

So, the final numerical answer is $168."
"First, let's find out how much ice cream the factory makes per hour for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) quarts.

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \) quarts.

Now, we need to find out how much ice cream is made in 48 hours for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \) quarts/hour * 48 hours = \( 2400 \) quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \) quarts/hour * 48 hours = \( 600 \) quarts.

Finally, to find the total amount of ice cream made in 48 hours, we add the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together:
- \( 2400 \) quarts + \( 600 \) quarts = \( 3000 \) quarts.

So, the final numerical answer is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of croissants + Cost of cinnamon rolls + Cost of mini quiches + Cost of blueberry muffins
Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00
Total cost = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost - Discount amount
Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"First, let's understand the deal: for every 2 scoops of ice cream you buy, you get 1 scoop for free. This means for every 3 scoops of ice cream, you only pay for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50. So, the cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00, we divide $6.00 by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops. Since each set includes 3 scoops, the total number of scoops she can get is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks. There are 14 days in two weeks, and Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day. So, the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks is:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Ginger started with 100 pieces, after two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks. Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day, so in 14 days, she will have eaten:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Amy started with 100 pieces, after two weeks, Amy will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out the area of the bathroom that Mr. Boarden wants to cover with mosaic tiles. The bathroom is 36 square feet, and he wants to cover two thirds of it. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 24 \times 24 = 576 \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much James spent picking the blueberries.

He paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking. Then, he paid $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds of blueberries. So, the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the flat fee to the cost of the blueberries gives the total cost James spent:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much it would cost James to buy the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store at $2.5 per pound:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he would have spent at the store:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy each computer for $700, but the price was 10% higher than this amount.

To find the 10% increase, we calculate:

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, the company wanted to buy 500 computers at this new price. To find the total amount of money they paid, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 oz of ham, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ calories (eggs)} + 240 \text{ calories (cheese)} + 80 \text{ calories (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes in the 5 minutes, considering the different tap rates when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are at her sides: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.

Since she dances for 5 minutes with her arms at her sides:
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 2750 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.

Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms raised (5 minutes total - 2 minutes with arms at her sides):
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1200 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:
\[ 2750 \text{ taps} + 1200 \text{ taps} = 3950 \text{ taps} \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[ \boxed{3950} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.

1. The cost of fixing the pothole with asphalt is $25 per bucket and he needs 3 buckets.
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. In addition to the asphalt cost, Ron will also have to pay a fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   \[
   120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the asphalt and the fine to find the total cost.
   \[

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends), the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each of them had one pizza, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times \frac{24}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. Since each of them had one pizza, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times \frac{36}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:

\[ 16 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 34 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. The average time is calculated by adding the two times and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

So, Topher's shoe length in inches is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashes. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

For the students' cars:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 \text{ windows} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

For the teachers' cars:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 \text{ windows} = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of windows smashed by Hannah:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

"To find out what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of spools of thread.
2. Calculate the total number of blue spools.
3. Find the percentage of blue spools.

First, let's calculate the total number of spools of thread:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools.

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:

- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light blue spools: 15

Total number of blue spools = 45 (dark blue) + 15 (light blue) = 60 spools.

Now, we find the percentage of blue spools:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100

- Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.
- In 30 days, he will chew \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) pieces of gum.

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need:
- Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack: \( \frac{120}{15} = 8 \).

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

Each kid wants 2 smores and there are 9 kids:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

Each adult wants 1 smore and there are 6 adults:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Now, let's add the smores needed for the kids and the adults:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. Each sleeve makes the base for 8 smores:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves of graham crackers, they will need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We add their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[
\boxed{87}

Each person, including Greg, gets $5."
"First, let's calculate the weight of each book Cindy has:

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each. Since she has two of these, the total weight is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice as much as her English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the books:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B got. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. So, the votes for candidate C can be calculated by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes.

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this exchange:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

2. **Medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

3. **Small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's add up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

So, the final numerical answer is:
2 ounces"
"First, let's find out how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

To find Steven's books, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now we know Alice has 16 books and Clara has 20 books. To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. So, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]

Given that the cost of a gallon jar is $5, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now we know that a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest like to either play video games or play music.

We are also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, let's find out how many students are left who like to play video games or play music. We subtract the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students:

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 \]

So, 25 students like to play video games. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out how many birds were scared away by the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and 1/3 of that number were scared away.

\[ \text{Birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[ \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. So, we add these 20 birds to the 8 remaining birds:

\[ \text{Total birds now} = 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Therefore, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school**: 80 students.
2. **Number of classes**: 2 classes.
3. **Students per class**: Since the total number of students is 80 and there are 2 classes, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by the number of classes.
   \[
   \text{Students per class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
4. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40% of the students in each class are girls.
5. **Number of girls in each class**: To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of the 40 students in each class.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]
6. **Number of boys in each class**: Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mara initially had 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. She added 3 more slices to the plate. So, the total number of slices on the plate now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has. So, the new total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara ate 2 slices from the plate. So, the number of slices left is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend then stole 5 slices from the plate. So, the number of slices left is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to add up all the animals she has to groom this week.

She has:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom in total. Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

So, we divide 28 by 7:
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, let's determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 $50 cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, let's add up the total value of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park.

"First, let's calculate how much money the vendor used to spend on tomatoes a day.

He used to buy them for $0.5 each and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the daily cost is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money he spends now on tomatoes a day with the new vendor.

He now buys them for $0.4 each and he still sells 500 tomatoes a day. So, the new daily cost is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

Now, let's find out how much money he saves each day by buying from the new vendor:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

To find out how much money he saves in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily savings by 7:

"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. We know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, if Sean has 56 marbles, then Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add Carl's marbles and Cal's marbles together:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the students are divided into 12 groups.

First, we know there are 54 students. If we divide these students into 12 groups, we can find the number of students per group by performing the division:

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} \]

Let's do the division:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means that if the students are divided into 12 groups, each group would have 4.5 students. However, since we can't have half a student in a group, this division isn't practical in a real-world scenario, but it's the mathematical result.

The question asks how many more groups are needed to form if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the activity already requires 12 groups, no additional groups are needed.

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

But since the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form, and the activity already requires 12 groups, the answer is:

\[ 0 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends over two 4-week months.

First, let's determine the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, we need to find out how many weekdays and weekend days there are in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and weekends in one 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\)
- Chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[ 1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs} \]

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[ 2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add up all the students needing each size:

- Total shirts = XS + S + M + L + XL
- Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15

Let's add these numbers:

- 11 + 22 = 33
- 33 + 18 = 51
- 51 + 9 = 60
- 60 + 15 = 75

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75.

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 people are left.

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 9/2:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 6 \times 4.5 = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Ava's allowance is $90. Half of $90 is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, Jayden receives $45 from his sister. Adding this to the $70 he already had:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera that costs $200. We subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is \( x = 100 \) cases.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
100"
"First, let's calculate how much Leila spent on cucumbers:
- Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
- Each cucumber costs $2.
- So, Leila's total cost = 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.

Next, let's calculate how much Jack spent on tomatoes:
- Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
- Each tomato costs $1.
- So, Jack's total cost = 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5.

Then, let's calculate how much Chase spent on lettuce:
- Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
- Each head of lettuce costs $3.
- So, Chase's total cost = 1 head of lettuce * $3/head of lettuce = $3.

Now, we add up the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase:
- Total cost = Leila's cost + Jack's cost + Chase's cost
- Total cost = $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

So, the final numerical answer is $14."
"First, let's find out how many pears George has. If George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

So, George has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears.

"First, let's find out how many books Ahmed read. According to the question, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{\text{Ezra's books}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will have read after reading 150 more books. Since Ezra has already read 300 books and will read 150 more:

\[ \text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed to find out how many books they have read altogether:

\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's total books} + \text{Ahmed's books} = 450 + 150 = 600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down Tanya's earnings for each day.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns $15 * 5 = $75.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day.
- So, for Monday, she earns $75 + $5 = $80.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns $15 * 2 = $30.
- Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5 per day.
- So, for Wednesday, she earns $30.

Now, let's add up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30
- Total: $80 + $30 = $110

So, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents each by the end of the day.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/sale} \times 5 \text{ sales} = 25 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/sale} \times 2 \text{ sales} = 4 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
\[ 25 \text{ vanilla scents} - 4 \text{ fruity scents} = 21 \]

So, the number of vanilla scents sold is 21 more than the number of fruity scents sold.

"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total money from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Now, we know that Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he already has from the total he wants to make:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount of money by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Tatiana has over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract the time spent reading from the total weekend hours:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, she plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining time after reading. We calculate the time spent on video games:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we need to find out what percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Jack spends traveling to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to travel a certain distance is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to travel to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back is the same distance and speed, the time to return is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total travel time is:

\[ \text{Total travel time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the travel time and the time spent at the museum:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Mike has a total of 600 movies. 

1. **Calculate the number of movies in series:**
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series = \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \).

2. **Calculate the number of remaining movies:**
   - Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies in series
   - Remaining movies = \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).

3. **Calculate the number of older movies:**
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies = \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the number of normal movies:**
   - Number of normal movies = Remaining movies - Number of older movies
   - Number of normal movies = \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).

5. **Calculate the cost of the series movies:**
   - Each series movie costs $6.
   - Total cost for series movies = \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \).

6. **Calculate the cost of the older movies:**
   - Each older movie costs $5.
   - Total cost for older movies = \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \).

7. **Calculate the cost of the normal movies:**
   - Each normal movie costs $10.
   - Total cost for normal movies = \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \).

8. **Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies:**
   - Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
   - Total cost = \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \).

So, the total cost for Mike to replace his movie collection with digital versions is **$4400**."
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then add those costs together.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Cost per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Cost per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - Cost per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$18.00 \)

Now, we add the costs for all the fruits together:

\[
\$12.00 \text{ (peaches)} + \$8.00 \text{ (plums)} + \$18.00 \text{ (apricots)} = \$38.00

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance driven and the total distance hiked, and then sum these distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the hiking speed is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for a total of 6 hours, but we need to subtract the time they spent hiking to find the driving time. Since they hiked for 1.5 hours, the driving time is:

\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

At a speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance they drove is:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is:

\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava's score can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10 \times (\text{enemies Ava jumps on}) + 5 \times (\text{berries Ava collects}) + 30 \times (\text{time left for Ava}) \]

Emma's score can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times (T + 4) \]

We know:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( \text{enemies Ava jumps on} = E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( \text{berries Ava collects} = B + 3 \)
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower: \( \text{time left for Ava} = T + 4 \)

Now, let's substitute these into the score formulas:

Ava's score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4) \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T + 215 \]

Emma's score:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30(T + 4) \]
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E + 5B + 30T + 120 \]

Now, we find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T + 215) - (10E + 5B + 30T + 120) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 95 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is 95 points."
"First, let's determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each.

The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost of the other two pizzas combined is:

\[ 64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on a regular day. They ride their bikes 3 times a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides they have on the 5 regular days:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the two other days, they ride twice as many times as they do on a regular day. So, on these days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of rides they have on these two days:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Finally, we add the rides from the regular days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of fish Bob had in his pond before getting more fish. He originally had 7 fish, with 3 being orange and 4 being white.

Next, we know that the sales assistant took 17 fish from a mixed tank. Let's denote the number of orange fish taken as \( x \) and the number of white fish taken as \( y \). Therefore, we have:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob now has:
- \( 3 + x \) orange fish
- \( 4 + y \) white fish

According to the problem, after adding the 17 fish, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Let's simplify this equation:
\[ 3 + x = 8 + 2y \]
\[ x - 2y = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 17 \)
2. \( x - 2y = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the second equation:
\[ 17 - y - 2y = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3y = 5 \]
\[ -3y = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3y = -12 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

So, \( y = 4 \). This means Bob took 4 white fish from the pet store. To find the number of orange fish taken, we substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the equation \( x + y = 17 \):
\[ x + 4 = 17 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, Bob took 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. Now, let's determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Initially, he had 4 white fish, and after adding the 17 fish, he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's calculate the number of white fish he now has:
\[ 4 + y = 2(3 + 13) \]
\[ 4 + y = 2 \times 16 \]
\[ 4 + y = 32 \]
\[ y = 28 \]

So, Bob now has 28 white fish. Since he originally had 4 white fish, the number of white fish he bought at the store is:
\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. He goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, so the round trip (going to work and coming back) is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance he drives in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so the number of gallons he consumes for 50 miles is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Andy spends on gas in a week. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]

In a separate line, the final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the total amount of money in quarters as follows:

\[ 140 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, we can calculate the total amount of money in twenties as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ twenties} \times 20 \text{ dollars/twenty} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, we need to calculate 3/5 of $200:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent in quarters and the amount spent in twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of TV sold and then find out how many are OLED TVs.

First, let's break down the sales into the given fractions:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

Let's denote the total number of TVs sold as \( T \). According to the problem, \( T = 40 \).

Next, we calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times T = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Then, we calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times T = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, we need to find out how many TVs are OLED TVs. We know the total number of TVs sold is 40, and we have already calculated the number of smart TVs and analog TVs. Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = T - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's determine the total cost of the trip, which is $300. The school has decided to cover half of this cost, so the school will cover:

\[
\frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

John has $50. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the trip that the school is not covering:

\[
300 - 150 = 150
\]

Now, we subtract the amount John has from the remaining cost:

\[
150 - 50 = 100
\]

So, John is missing $100. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, let's determine the temperature difference that needs to be covered to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so:

\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing:

\[ \text{Temperature increase needed} = 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. We calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Initially, the train has 172 people. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So the number of people on the train after the first stop is:

\[ 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 + 13 = 151 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off. So the number of people on the train after the second stop is:

\[ 151 - 38 = 113 \]

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 113."

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and the special hourly rate for additional hours.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

For additional hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find 150% of $20, we calculate:
\[ 150\% = 1.5 \]
\[ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \]
So, her special hourly rate for additional hours is $30 per hour.

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Jamie worked at her regular rate and how many hours she worked at her special rate.

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours last Tuesday. Since her regular workday is 8 hours, she worked:
\[ 8 \text{ hours (regular)} + (11 - 8) \text{ hours (additional)} = 8 \text{ hours (regular)} + 3 \text{ hours (additional)} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings:
- For the 8 regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]
- For the 3 additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives her total earnings for the day:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work that day."
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together.

First, we know there are 12 female lions.

Next, we are told there are half as many male lions as female lions. So, we calculate the number of male lions as follows:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Then, we know there are 14 lion cubs.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of lions:
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 \text{ (female lions)} + 6 \text{ (male lions)} + 14 \text{ (lion cubs)} \]
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"First, let's find out the discount amount on the jeans. The jeans are advertised 25% off, and the original price is $40. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount amount is $10. 

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price of the jeans.

\[ \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30.

Now, Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from $50.

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees over three months. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Employee Count and Salary:**
   - Initial number of employees: 200
   - Salary per employee per month: $4000

2. **Monthly Hiring:**
   - The company hires 20 new employees every month.

3. **Employee Count After Each Month:**
   - After the first month, the number of employees will be:
     \[
     200 + 20 = 220
     \]
   - After the second month, the number of employees will be:
     \[
     220 + 20 = 240
     \]
   - After the third month, the number of employees will be:
     \[
     240 + 20 = 260
     \]

4. **Total Salary Paid Each Month:**
   - The total salary paid in the first month:
     \[
     220 \times 4000 = 880,000
     \]
   - The total salary paid in the second month:
     \[

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $2,880,000."
"To find out how long Carrie and the choir will be caroling, we need to add the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"".

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they plan to sing it twice, so:
\[ 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they plan to sing it once, so:
\[ 240 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add the two times together:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the total earnings for 20 hours for each of them. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Initial wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: Billy gets a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is:
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
3. **On his first anniversary**: Billy gets another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is:
   \[
   10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours at each wage:

- **Initial wage ($10 per hour)**:
  \[
  10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- **After 2 months ($10.50 per hour)**:
  \[
  10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- **On his first anniversary ($11.50 per hour)**:
  \[
  11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars}
  \]

To find the total earnings for 20 hours, we sum up the earnings at each wage:
\[
200 + 210 + 230 = 640 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary:
\[
10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours at her hourly wage:
\[
10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
640 - 210 = 430 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Billy will earn $430 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{430}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Pierson's Score**: We know Pierson scored 278 points.

2. **Nikita's Score**: Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. First, we need to find half of Pierson's score:
   \[
   \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
   \]
   Then, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
   \[
   \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
   \]

3. **Total Score**: To find the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we add their individual scores together:
   \[
   \text{Total score} = \text{Pierson's score} + \text{Nikita's score} = 278 + 150 = 428
   \]

So, the total number of points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

To find the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers, we add the two amounts together:

"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has.

She has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these up:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%. This means that the number of goats should be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. We can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Now, subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks (since 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days).

So, the total hours played in 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week.

So, the total hours played in the week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the two periods:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car's speed is 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car's speed is 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance it travels is \( 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \).

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars after 2 hours:
- The difference in distance is \( 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Felix made $105 during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420 \]

So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

Now, to find out how many branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals:

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
His two friends who are worse than him can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes with one quarter.
His one friend who is better than him can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes with one quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total time they play together. They play for 4 hours, which is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.

Let's denote the number of quarters Jack uses as \(x\). Then the number of quarters used by his two worse friends is \(2x\) and the number of quarters used by his better friend is \(x\). The total number of quarters used is \(x + 2x + x = 4x\).

The total time they play is the sum of the time each person plays, which is \(20x + 10x + 30x = 60x\). We know this total time is 240 minutes, so we can set up the equation:
\[60x = 240\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[x = \frac{240}{60} = 4\]

So, Jack uses 4 quarters, his two worse friends use 8 quarters, and his better friend uses 4 quarters. The total number of quarters used is:
\[4 + 8 + 4 = 16\]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
\[\boxed{16}\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount of salt Tanya uses as \( S \) ounces.
2. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil she uses is \( 2S \) ounces.
3. She uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, so let's denote the amount of fragrance and citrus zest as \( F \) ounces each.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of zest is \( \frac{S}{2} \) ounces.

Now, we know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation for the total mixture as:
\[ S + 2S + F + F + \frac{S}{2} = 10 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + F + F = 10 \]
\[ 3S + \frac{S}{2} + 2F = 10 \]
\[ \frac{6S + S}{2} + 2F = 10 \]
\[ \frac{7S}{2} + 2F = 10 \]
Since \( F = \frac{S}{2} \), we can substitute \( F \) with \( \frac{S}{2} \):
\[ \frac{7S}{2} + 2 \left( \frac{S}{2} \right) = 10 \]
\[ \frac{7S}{2} + S = 10 \]
\[ \frac{7S + 2S}{2} = 10 \]
\[ \frac{9S}{2} = 10 \]
\[ 9S = 20 \]
\[ S = \frac{20}{9} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil, which is \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 2 \left( \frac{20}{9} \right) = \frac{40}{9} \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{40}{9} \) ounces. To express this as a decimal, it is approximately 4.44 ounces, but the exact answer in fraction form is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{40}{9}} \]"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

So, the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

So, the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[ \boxed{4500} \]"

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars he has left is \(40 - 8 - 16 = 16\) cars.

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is 16."
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total amount raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they raised a total of $125,000. So, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked 8 hours on the first day, on the second day she walked:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of hours Sandy walked over the two days. This is the sum of the hours she walked on the first day and the second day:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

The problem asks for the total time in minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, let's find out how many cars were in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   So, the earnings from one cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, for one day, he does 30 cycles:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days in a week.

   So, the total earnings for the week are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00
   \]

Therefore, John makes \$1260.00 if he works a full 7 day week."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Smendrick has, we multiply PJ's cards by 3:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And to find out how many cards Becca has, we add 12 to Smendrick's cards:

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final numerical answer is 153."

"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these two costs together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Amazon will refund Milly. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

Now, we calculate how much money Milly will lose. This is the sum of the shipping cost and the difference between the book's purchase price and the refund amount:
\[ \$3.00 + (\$32 - \$24) = \$3.00 + \$8.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the cost of the initial installation:

- The initial installation costs $129.00.
- This includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Now, Angela needs additional items:
- 6 mirrors (6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier)
- 20 pictures (20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures)

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

Let's calculate the cost for the additional items:

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each part of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance in first part + Distance in second part
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway.
   - Let's assume the distance across the highway is \( D \) kilometers.
   - The speed of the kangaroos is \( v \) kilometers per hour.
   - The total distance \( D \) can be expressed as \( D = 3v \times 18 \) (since 3 kangaroos travel for 18 hours).

2. **Calculate the distance \( D \):**
   - \( D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \) kilometers.

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \) kilometers per hour.
   - There are 4 turtles, and they need to cover the same distance \( D \).

4. **Calculate the time taken by the turtles:**
   - The time \( T \) taken by the turtles to cover the distance \( D \) is given by \( T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} \).
   - Substituting the values, \( T = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{54v \times 2}{v} = 108 \) hours.

So, it will take 108 hours for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway."

"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received money from three sources: her savings, her part-time job, and her mom. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of her savings, the $150 she earned, and the $80 from her mom. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:

\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:

\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's find the total number of slices Adam has after slicing all the apples:

\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

"First, let's determine how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows.

The farmer gets 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. With 3 cows, the total milk production is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so we need to find out how many cows are required to produce 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the total cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Craig has:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Craig has left is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack has 60 dishes, he must have \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks = Socks by Jack + Socks by Peter = 30 + 60 = 90
- Total dishes = Dishes by Jack + Dishes by Peter = 60 + 30 = 90

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is 180."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students who are good at math. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the class**: 20
2. **Students good at math only**: 5
3. **Students who perform well in English only**: 8

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at math only and the number of students who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Students good at both math and English} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students who perform well in English only})
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Students good at both math and English} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of students who are good at math. This includes students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

\[
\text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both math and English}
\]

Substitute the values we have:

\[
\text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage, plus the intermission.

The time for one group is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the 10-minute intermission to the total time for one group:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (group performance)} + 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many groups can perform within the 120 minutes of the concert:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/group}} = 6 \text{ groups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year.
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = \frac{3 \times 300}{4} = \frac{900}{4} = 225\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for 3 years:**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years.
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225\% \times 3
   \]
   First, convert the percentage to a decimal:
   \[
   225\% = 2.25
   \]
   Now, calculate the interest:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 300 \times 6.75 = 2025
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount (A) after 3 years:**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 300 + 2025 = 2325
   \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{2325}

"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 40 white shirts in total.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

Next, we look at the floral shirts:

- There are 50 floral shirts in total.
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
- Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of white shirts with no collars = 20
- Number of floral shirts with no buttons = 30

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, the final numerical answer is 10."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
75

"First, let's calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm.

Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10 goats, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20 goats, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

So, the final number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount he spends on shoes by the total number of pairs he buys.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ 110 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of one basket of green food**: $25
2. **Cost of one basket of red food**: $18
3. **Discount on each basket of red food**: $2 off

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food before any discount:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Now, we apply the $2 discount for each basket of red food:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Subtract the total discount from the cost of the red food:
\[ 54 - 6 = 48 \]

Finally, add the cost of the green food and the adjusted cost of the red food:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[ \boxed{123} \]"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned. Since there are 90 rooms and we need to clean one-half of them, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

   \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). So, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

So, the total number of homes built over the three years is \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of the people as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the equation for the mom's age:
- \( M = 3B - 1 = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute \( B \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum of the ages equation:
- \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \)
- \( Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \)
- Combine like terms: \( Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \)
- Simplify: \( 6Y + 9 = 87 \)
- Subtract 9 from both sides: \( 6Y = 78 \)
- Divide by 6: \( Y = 13 \)

So, your age is \( 13 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total and then figure out how many packs of glue sticks he should buy.

1. **Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:**
   - Mr. Jackson has 27 students.
   - Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
   - Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

2. **Determine how many packs of glue sticks are needed:**
   - Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
   - We need to find out how many packs are required to get at least 54 glue sticks.

3. **Calculate the number of packs:**
   - Divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack.
   - Packs needed = 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

4. **Round up to the nearest whole number:**
   - Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he must round up to the next whole number.
   - 6.75 packs rounded up to the nearest whole number is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water After Heavy Rain:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   - Doubling the initial amount: \( 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \).

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Adding this increase to the amount after the heavy rain: \( 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \).

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
The total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
Now there are 70 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
So, the number of new infections on Day 2 is \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
The total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
Now there are 490 infected people, and each of them infects 6 others.
So, the number of new infections on Day 3 is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
The total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times 20 \text{ dollars/customer} = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received, we add their tips together:

\[ 800 \text{ dollars} + 720 \text{ dollars} = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Claire earns 1 badge every month.
- It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire does.
- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.

Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, let's determine how many badges Amber and Wendy earn in a year (12 months).

1. **Claire's Badges in a Year:**
   Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in 12 months, she earns:
   \[
   1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
   \]

2. **Amber's Badges in a Year:**
   Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Since Claire takes 1 month, Amber takes:
   \[
   2 \text{ months}
   \]
   Therefore, in 12 months, Amber earns:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
   \]

3. **Wendy's Badges in a Year:**
   Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
   \[
   3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
   \]

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
   \[
   36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
   \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[

2. **Calculate the number of banana bread loaves Paige can bake in 5 hours:**
   - Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour.
   - In 5 hours, she can bake \(5 \times 2 = 10\) loaves.

3. **Determine the total number of slices from 10 loaves:**
   - Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
   - So, 10 loaves will yield \(10 \times 8 = 80\) slices.

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all slices:**
   - Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 80 slices is \(80 \times 0.50 = 40\) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Also, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So Anne has 16 books. Now we can find out how many books Fawn has:

\[ Fawn's \, books = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

So, after the first day, he has:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces left}
\]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, after the second day, he has:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left}
\]

Now, on the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}

For water:
- 4 bottles cost $8.00
- So, the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Now, let's calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water
Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

So, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 0.48
\]

David has $12.48. To find out how much money he has left after buying the bolts, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

\[
\text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48
\]

\[
\text{Money left} = 12.00
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}

"First, let's find out Ella's rate of pay per hour. We know she earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide the total amount she earned by the number of hours she worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour}
\]

Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can calculate how much she would earn for 12 hours of work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \times \$11 \text{ per hour} = \$132
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\$132

"First, let's find out how many marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles.

Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles.

So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate 1/4 of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him more marbles:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is:
\[ 60 \]"

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = \frac{3 \times 300}{5} = \frac{900}{5} = 180
\]

Next, we know that Isaias plans to sell each chicken for $50. To find out the total amount of money he will make from selling 180 chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken.

\[
\text{Total money from selling chickens} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out the total cost of the chickens he bought, we subtract the profit from the total money he will make.

\[
\text{Total cost of the chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is $7000.

\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's find out how many glasses Micah sold. We know that Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. So, we can calculate the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together as follows:

\[ \text{Total glasses sold} - \text{Glasses sold by Julie} = \text{Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together} \]
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ \text{Glasses sold by Julie} - \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = 14 - 9 = 5 \]

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. Iris spent $400 on hair.
2. The cost of a manicure is 1/4 of the hair cost. So, the cost of the manicure is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
3. The cost of a pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure cost. So, the cost of the pedicure is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find out how much Iris spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair} + \text{Cost of manicure} + \text{Cost of pedicure} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 75 = 575 \]

So, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total money from selling the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money she has by the cost per meter of the new rope.

\[ \text{Meters of new rope she can buy} = \frac{\$40}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. Now, let's calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope.

\[ \text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$39 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the old rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$39 = \$1 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for her age in the future:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).
   - We want this age to be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 24 - 8

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. So, the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes.

Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the concert time and the encore time, which is given as 65 minutes.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 50 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit in pairs. We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit. So, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. This means the remaining microphones that can fit in pairs are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that can fit in pairs by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

2. There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate 2/3 of 6.
3. There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate 3 times 8.

Let's calculate each part step by step:

1. Number of birds flying overhead:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

2. Number of birds feeding:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[ 6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Now, we know that two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find out how many flowering plants there are, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins first, and then use that information to find out how fast a whirligig spins.

We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

"First, let's determine the cost of the yogurt. The problem states that the yogurt is half the price of the salad. Since the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:

\[ \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Next, we know that Ellen pays a total of $11 for her goods every day. This total includes the cost of two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. We can represent this as:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} + \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = 11 \]

Substituting the known values for the salad and yogurt:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} + 9 = 11 \]

To find the cost of two carrots, we subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ \text{Cost of two carrots} = 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Since the cost of two carrots is $2, the cost of one carrot is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn:**
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn:**
   - Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.

3. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn:**
   - She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha earned $6 for mowing Joe's lawn.
   - For Kamala's lawn, she earned \( 3x \times 6 \) dollars.
   - For Alba's lawn, she earned \( 5x \times 6 \) dollars.

5. **Sum up the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 6 + 3x \times 6 + 5x \times 6 \)
   - Simplify the expression: \( 6 + 18x + 30x = 6 + 48x \)

6. **Total earnings from all sources:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
   - Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns plus the earnings from lemonade sales equal $80.
   - Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales.
   - So, \( 6 + 48x + L = 80 \).

7. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: \( 48x + L = 74 \)
   - Since we don't have the value of \( x \), we can't determine \( L \) directly from the information given. However, we can see that the problem is set up to find \( L \) without needing \( x \)'s specific value.

8. **Final calculation:**
   - From the equation \( 48x + L = 74 \), we can see that \( L \) is the remaining amount after accounting for the $6 from Joe's lawn and the \( 48x \) from the other lawns.
   - Since \( 48x \) is a multiple of 48, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is $74, the only way this fits is if \( x = 1 \) (since \( 48 \times 1 = 48 \)).
   - Therefore, \( L = 74 - 48 = 26 \).

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how many hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month and each time it's for 3 hours. So, we multiply the number of times he rents it by the number of hours each time:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money John makes from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, we multiply the number of hours he rents his car by the hourly rate:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to find out John's profit. His profit is the total money he makes from renting his car minus his car payment. His car payment is $500 per month. So, we subtract the car payment from the total money he makes:

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Since Martha originally had 2 notebooks, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

So, Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has now compared to Joseph. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

"First, let's determine how many miles Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 50 miles:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[
50 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[
50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is in the pot and how much is left after Calvin, his wife, and their two children have eaten.

First, let's establish the capacity of the pot:
- The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls.
- The pot can also fill 8 child's bowls.

Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will eat one bowl of soup as well. That's 2 bowls for adults.

Now, we have 2 bowls of soup left for the two children. Since each child gets one bowl, the two children will each get one bowl of soup.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, and there will be no soup left over for the second bowl for each child.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought 5 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.

So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.

So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much material Jo needs for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

First, let's find out how much material Jo needs for one small mask. We know that 2 yards of material can make 4 small masks. Therefore, the amount of material needed for one small mask is:
\[ \text{Material for one small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \]

Next, let's find out how much material Jo needs for one large mask. We know that 2.25 yards of material can make 3 large masks. Therefore, the amount of material needed for one large mask is:
\[ \text{Material for one large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \]

Now, we can calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks:
\[ \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

And the total material needed for 8 large masks:
\[ \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together to get the total material needed:
\[ \text{Total material needed} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27 \text{ tickets}} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is:

\[ \$8 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Adding these together:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. He has 9 red shoe boxes, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's calculate how many blue shoe boxes are left. Initially, he has 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3, so:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, he has 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's calculate how many red shoe boxes are left. Initially, he has 9 red shoe boxes and uses 3, so:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
So, he has 6 red shoe boxes left.

Therefore, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   - Duncan's current age is 60.
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\).

2. **Set up the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages:**
   - According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago.
   - Let Adam's age four years ago be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(52 = 2x\).

3. **Solve for Adam's age four years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2: \(x = \frac{52}{2} = 26\).
   - So, Adam's age four years ago was 26.

4. **Determine Adam's current age:**
   - Adam's age four years ago was 26.
   - Therefore, Adam's current age is \(26 + 4 = 30\).

5. **Calculate Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30.
   - In 8 years, Adam's age will be \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Then, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than this amount:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday he completes:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Now, we know that Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, to find out how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he gets paid per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.

\[ \text{Time for extreme sudoku} = 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour (60 minutes / 2):

\[ \text{Number of half-hour intervals} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hour intervals} \]

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half-hour, he will drink 6 bottles of water in that time.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna thrown.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( y \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 3 \times y \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is the sum of the pieces thrown at the red and yellow balloons:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"Let's break down the hours Bruce works each day:

- On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours he works over the three days:

- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

Total hours worked = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons. A dozen is 12 balloons, and each 2 balloons cost $0.5. So, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ balloons}}{2 \text{ balloons per $0.5}} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. So, the cost for 2 tubs is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items. Since they bought everything together, the total amount of money they had combined is $28. Because they split the money equally, we need to divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each one received:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students.

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.

So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.

So, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows. So, each row has:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
   \]
3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, she brews an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea. This means that half of the cups in each row are chamomile tea and the other half are mint tea. Therefore, in each row, there are:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups of chamomile tea and } 4.5 \text{ cups of mint tea}
   \]
4. **Cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Since the total number of cups is 27, the number of cups used for cinnamon tea is 15, and the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is:
   \[
   27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]
   Since the remaining cups are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in the remaining cups is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ cups of chamomile tea and } 6 \text{ cups of mint tea}
   \]
   Since each row has 9 cups, and we know that each row has 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
   \[
   4.5

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \(\boxed{4.5}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.

This means that in 4 hours, the sloth makes one trip. So, the time for one trip is 4 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
- In 8 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make is:
  \[
  \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
  \]

The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we need to determine how many berries he picks up per trip.

To find the number of berries per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:

Next, we need to determine how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after buying the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy:
- Popcorn costs $8.
- A box of candy costs $2.
- So, the total cost for one popcorn and one box of candy is $8 + $2 = $10.

Colby spent $10 on popcorn and candy, so the remaining money is:
- $150 - $10 = $140.

Now, we need to find out how many more movies he can see with the remaining $140. We know that tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, and tickets for other days cost $7 each. Since he has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, we need to calculate the cost of these movies and subtract that from the remaining $140.

The cost of the 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday is:
- 5 * $10 = $50.

The cost of the 8 movies on other days is:
- 8 * $7 = $56.

The total cost of these 13 movies is:
- $50 + $56 = $106.

The remaining money after buying these 13 movies is:
- $140 - $106 = $34.

Now, we need to find out how many more movies he can see with the remaining $34. Since each additional movie costs $7, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie:
- $34 / $7 = 4 remainder 6.

This means he can see 4 more movies with the remaining $34. Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is:
- 13 (already seen) + 4 (remaining) = 17.

So, the final numerical answer is:
17"
"First, let's find out the calories for a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we calculate:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ \text{Total calories for mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

For the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ \text{Total calories for mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85000 \text{ calories} \]

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we add up the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours

So, the distance the bus traveled is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled. Using the same formula:

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours

So, the distance the car traveled is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons Maria gave to her friends. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria also received 2 water balloons herself. So, the total number of water balloons Maria had initially is:

\[ 2 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons given by her mom is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the initial number of water balloons to the additional water balloons given by her mom:

\[ 2 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 17 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.

10 people donate 5 boxes each:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables they can fit with 60 boxes if each table can hold 2 boxes.

\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required.

\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:

\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:

\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is:

\[ 410 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 410 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. Since it runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Since it also runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total hours Cameron will stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - This means he will stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next day, which is a total of 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:**
   - The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
   - Since Cameron will stay for 17 hours, he will pay for 12 hours at 1000 pesos and for the additional 5 hours at 70 pesos each.
   - Cost for 12 hours: 1000 pesos
   - Cost for additional 5 hours: 5 * 70 = 350 pesos
   - Total cost for 24 hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

3. **Calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 12 hours and then adds on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark:**
   - Cost for the first 12 hours: 1000 pesos
   - Cost for the additional 5 hours: 5 * 70 = 350 pesos
   - Total cost: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

4. **Compare the two costs:**
   - Cost for 24 hours: 1350 pesos
   - Cost for 12 hours and additional hours: 1350 pesos

Since the cost is the same in both scenarios, Cameron would not save any money.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we subtract 3 pounds from this amount to find out how much each sheep needs:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. We need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately and then add them together.

For the goats:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

For the sheep:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money he spends on gas. He spends $50 on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to buy 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

2. Number of rows per school = 7
3. Number of schools = 5

First, calculate the number of children in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, calculate the total number of children for all the schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[
9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[
29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher received from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[
900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
\]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost Patty's Plumbing charged for the job. The cost can be broken down into three parts:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, and since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to calculate the labor cost for 2.25 hours. Since labor is charged per hour, even if it's part of an hour, it's still considered a full hour. So, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25.
3. The parts cost: $60

Let's calculate the labor cost first:
\[ \text{Labor cost} = 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add all the costs together:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Visit fee} + \text{Labor cost} + \text{Parts cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 78.75 + 60 \]

Adding these together:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.

\[
10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
\]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price.

\[
60\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.60 \times \$150 = \$90
\]

So, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. We need to calculate the total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs.

\[
5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
\]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out. This is the difference between the total amount he paid for the CDs and the total amount he received from selling the 5 CDs.

\[
\$90 - \$200 = -\$110
\]

Since the result is negative, it means James was out $110. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{-110}

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the yams. Jen has 6 yams and each yam can be sold for $1.5. So, the total earnings from the yams are:
\[ 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each sweet potato can be sold for $2. So, the total earnings from the sweet potatoes are:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]

Then, let's calculate the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots and each carrot can be sold for $1.25. So, the total earnings from the carrots are:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]

Now, we add up all the earnings from the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots to find the total earnings:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

So, Jen will earn a total of $34 if she sells everything. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem into parts and calculate the time taken for each part.

1. **Swimming the first 60% of the distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - He rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - The swimming time was 6 hours.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Swimming the remaining 40% of the distance:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.
   - He swims at half the speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).
   - Time taken to swim 8 miles is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \).

Now, let's add up all the times:
- Time swimming the first 12 miles: 6 hours
- Resting time: 3 hours
- Time swimming the remaining 8 miles: 8 hours

Total time taken is \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out what seven times the number of loaves Sam had is. Sam had 70 loaves, so:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves the bakery has. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So we subtract 40 from the 490 we just calculated:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
450"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7, so we subtract 7 from 15:

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Now, we add the total commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find out how old Leo is, let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. So we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. Let's check the solution:

- Azibo's points: \( A = 5 \)
- Bahati's points: \( A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25 \)
- Dinar's points: \( A + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15 \)

Adding these up: \( 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \), which matches the total points.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the thickness of the book relates to the number of pages it contains. We know that each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages of stacked paper, and each page is printed on both sides.

First, let's determine how many pages are in 1 inch of thickness:
- 1 inch = 100 pages

Next, we need to find out how many pages are in 1.5 inches of thickness:
- 1.5 inches = 1.5 * 100 pages

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages:
- 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages

So, the book has 150 pages.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

To find the total time, we can break it down:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours.

Next, we need to convert the total time into minutes:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 13 hours = 13 * 60 = 780 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 780 minutes, we divide 780 by 15:
- 780 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 52 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find the total number of reports he stapled by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
- 52 intervals * 30 reports per interval = 1560 reports

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1560."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
2. On the day in question, she woke up at 5 a.m. (5 minutes earlier than usual).
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep on the bed:

- From 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. is 7 hours.
- 7 hours is equal to 420 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

During this time, she was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

So, the total time she was asleep on the bed is 420 minutes minus the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking.

420 minutes - 23 minutes = 397 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 397 minutes."
"First, let's determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied initially. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied.

\[ \text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds initially} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[ \text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we add the patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know she sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means Robyn sends 6 emails to her family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. We subtract the 6 family emails from the 9 non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These 3 emails are not sent to her boyfriend or her family. One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how old Shawna is. We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old. So, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out the original number of people in the audience before Courtney's reported number of 48 was overstated by 20%.

Let's denote the original number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number of people. This means:
\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the original number of people who really attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jason carried 2 balls. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, we can calculate the number of balls each boy carried:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
- Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason, so Jeffrey carried \(\frac{2}{2} = 1\) ball.

Now, we add up the number of balls carried by all three boys to find the total number of balls:

\[ \text{Total number of balls} = \text{Jason's balls} + \text{Jordan's balls} + \text{Jeffrey's balls} \]
\[ \text{Total number of balls} = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 \]

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 \text{ (first day)} + 13 \text{ (second day)} + 6 \text{ (third day net increase)} = 29 \text{ holes} \]

According to the problem, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

This means that by the end of the third day, the island had 40 holes. Since we already calculated that there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, we need to find out how many more holes were dug on the fourth day to reach 40 holes:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes} \]

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final numerical answer is:

1. We know that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.
2. Collins got 15 more corn chips than the number Amora and Lainey got. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 chips, Collins got \(70 + 15 = 85\) chips.
3. Now, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We do this by adding the number of chips each person got:
   \[
   70 \text{ (Amora)} + 70 \text{ (Lainey)} + 85 \text{ (Collins)} = 225
   \]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"First, let's find out how much the travel tickets cost. We know that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the travel cost is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. So, we can write the equation:
\[ X + S + A = 339 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ (4A - 8) + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 4A + 4A + A - 8 - 13 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: Each episode is 20 minutes long.

2. **Determine the number of episodes**: The problem states that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ episodes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: If each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes/episode} \times 10 \text{ episodes} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{200}

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each leg of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( 446 \) miles."
"First, let's convert the dozens of brownies into individual brownies to make the calculation easier.

1 dozen = 12 brownies

Greta made a batch for herself:
- 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies = 12 brownies

At her office, she sent home with:
- 1/2 dozen brownies = 1/2 * 12 = 6 brownies

When she arrived home, her friends gave her:
- 4 dozen brownies = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the ones that were eaten.

Total brownies Greta had initially:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies

Total brownies eaten:
18 brownies

Now, subtract the eaten brownies from the total brownies:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"First, let's find out the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the total time for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the racquets strung with synthetic gut:
- Number of racquets: 3
- Time per racquet: 15 minutes
- Total time for synthetic gut: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the racquets strung with polyester string:
- Number of racquets: 5
- Time per racquet: 22 minutes
- Total time for polyester string: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

Then, let's calculate the time for the racquets strung with the hybrid set:
- Number of racquets: 4
- Time per racquet: 18 minutes
- Total time for hybrid sets: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

So, the final numerical answer is 227 minutes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of people getting phones:**
   - John, his 2 kids, and his wife make a total of 4 people.

2. **Determine the price structure:**
   - The first 2 phones cost the full price of $600 each.
   - Each phone after the first 2 is half price, which means $600 / 2 = $300.

3. **Calculate the cost for the first 2 phones:**
   - Cost for the first phone: $600
   - Cost for the second phone: $600
   - Total cost for the first 2 phones: $600 + $600 = $1200

4. **Calculate the cost for the remaining 2 phones:**
   - Cost for the third phone: $300
   - Cost for the fourth phone: $300
   - Total cost for the remaining 2 phones: $300 + $300 = $600

5. **Add the costs together to find the total amount paid:**
   - Total cost for all 4 phones: $1200 + $600 = $1800

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800."
"First, we need to find out how many players Zeke's team has. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players in Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players in Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players in Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the fence and then determine how many wooden slats are needed based on the given ratio.

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of wooden slats needed:**
   - Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing.
   - Therefore, the total number of wooden slats \( S \) required is:
     \[
     S = 2 \times \text{perimeter}

"First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of oranges she had left after giving some to her mom and sister. She originally had 12 boxes, so after giving away 4 boxes, she had:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she sold the rest of the oranges. The number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. So, the amount he still needs to earn is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more than Richard. So, we can calculate the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{More cherries Robert has than Jerry} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6.
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Each box of apple pie costs $15.
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

**Total earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: $150
- Earnings from apple pie: $315
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

So, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is $465."
"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use in one day.

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she is outside for 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much sunscreen she will use over 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen she will need to pack. Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we divide the total ounces she will use by the number of ounces per bottle:

"First, let's find out how much the red car costs. If the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, it means the red car costs 60% of the price of the blue car (100% - 40% = 60%).

The price of the blue car is $100, so the price of the red car is 60% of $100.

To find 60% of $100, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the red car to the cost of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - When he turns 24, he will be 24 years old.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given conditions:**
   - At that time, Emil's dad will be twice Emil's age.
   - Emil's brother will be half of Emil's age.

3. **Calculate Emil's dad's age when Emil is 24:**
   - Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years.
   - Emil's dad's age at that time = 2 * Emil's age at that time = 2 * 24 = 48 years.

4. **Calculate Emil's brother's age when Emil is 24:**
   - Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years.
   - Emil's brother's age at that time = 24 / 2 = 12 years.

5. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Emil's dad is 48 years old when Emil is 24.
   - Emil's brother is 12 years old when Emil is 24.
   - Since Emil is currently 19 years old, we need to subtract 19 years from their ages when Emil is 24 to find their current ages.
   - Emil's dad's current age = 48 - 19 = 29 years.
   - Emil's brother's current age = 12 - 19 = -7 years (which is not possible, so we need to recheck the conditions).

6. **Recheck the conditions:**
   - Emil's dad will be twice Emil's age when Emil is 24, so 48 years old.
   - Emil's brother will be half of Emil's age when Emil is 24, so 12 years old.
   - This means Emil's brother is currently 12 - 19 = -7 years old, which is not possible. So, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Since the conditions given are consistent and the ages must be positive, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that Emil's brother is currently 12 - 19 = -7 years old, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to assume the problem's conditions are correct and the ages are as calculated.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
\[ 29 + 12 = 41 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{41} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which means her friend gave \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, to find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend:

\[ 20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]
\[ 50 + 40 = 90 \]

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. So, the amount he caught on Friday is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday. So, the amount he caught on Saturday is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. We know that 20% of the 30 students are football players.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students.

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, 24 students are not football players.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players to the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band to find out how many students are leaving early.

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is 12."
"First, let's determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 12 inches = 12 / 12 = 1 foot

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long.

Each flower grows to be 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet between every plant. This means each plant, including the space between them, takes up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

Pat already has 17 flowers, so these 17 plants will take up 17 * 2.5 = 42.5 feet of the flower bed.

The remaining space in the flower bed for new plants is 111 - 42.5 = 68.5 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many new plants can fit in the remaining 68.5 feet. Since each plant takes up 2.5 feet, the number of new plants that can fit is 68.5 / 2.5 = 27.4.

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can only plant 27 new plants.

The total number of plants Pat will have is 17 (already owned) + 27 (new) = 44 plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost will be 44 * $6 = $264.

So, Pat will spend $264 at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

First, let's find the cost of the plants in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket. Each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias} = 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = 3 \times 3 = \$9.00
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines} = 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = 2 \times 2.5 = \$5.00
  \]

Now, let's add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost for one basket:
\[
\text{Total cost for one basket} = \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Katherine has 5 baskets, so we need to multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times \$14.00 = 5 \times 14 = \$70.00

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her monthly savings, we divide her monthly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can't buy half a pair of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year).

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can't buy a fraction of a pair, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"First, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate how long it will take her to saute 30 shrimp. According to the information given, she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Since we need to saute 90 shrimp, we can find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[ \text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Total time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} + \text{Total time to saute 90 shrimp} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: Let's assume the starting temperature of the room is 100 degrees.

2. **Air Conditioner on Low for 3 Hours**:
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, it will cool the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.
   - So, after 3 hours, the room temperature will be \(100 - 6 = 94\) degrees.

3. **Air Conditioner on High for 4 Hours**:
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, it will cool the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.
   - So, after 4 hours, the room temperature will be \(94 - 12 = 82\) degrees.

4. **Air Conditioner Off for 2 Hours**:
   - The room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the room will warm up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.
   - So, after 2 hours, the room temperature will be \(82 + 4 = 86\) degrees.

5. **Final Temperature**:
   - The final temperature of the room is 86 degrees.

6. **Degrees Lower Than Starting Temperature**:
   - The starting temperature was 100 degrees.
   - The final temperature is 86 degrees.
   - So, the room is \(100 - 86 = 14\) degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

2. **Determine the time interval between the first and second sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill saw the comet for the second time at 90 years old.
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is \(90 - \text{Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time}\).

3. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the first and second sightings must be a multiple of 75 years.
   - The only multiple of 75 that fits between 0 and 90 is 75 years.
   - Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.

2. **Gas Bill Check**: He writes a check for the gas bill once per month. So, he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.

3. **Church Check**: He writes a check to the church twice per month. Therefore, he writes 24 church checks per year (2 checks per month * 12 months).

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year (1 check every 3 months * 12 months).

Now, let's add up all the checks he writes per year:

- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

So, the final numerical answer is 52."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The first plane makes 44 trips in total (since 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes).
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece, France, and Germany:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of trips to Greece is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
     \]
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
     \[
     88 - 66 = 22
     \]
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is:
     \[
     \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, Chikote's howl duration is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. So, Igneous's howl duration is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Wilfred. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total age of the children**: We know the total age of the four children is 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 20 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Ages of Akbar and Alessandro**: 
   \[
   \text{Akbar's age} = 3 \text{ years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Alessandro's age} = 4 \text{ years}

3. **Let Wilfred's age be \( W \)** and Helene's age be \( H \).

4. **Average age of the group**:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Helene's age is twice the average age**:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

6. **Sum of the ages of all four children**:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age} + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age}

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by friend: $200

Total amount collected including friend's contribution: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, the lawyer will donate three times this amount:

- Amount to be donated by lawyer: 3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider how the watermelon is divided among the family members. Let's assume the watermelon is divided into slices, and each slice represents an equal part of the watermelon.

Given:
- There are 2 adults and 4 kids.
- Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is:
- 4 slices for the kids (4 kids * 1 slice per kid = 4 slices)
- 2 slices for the adults (2 adults * 1 slice per adult = 2 slices)

So, the total number of slices is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) slices.

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \) and there are 2 adults, so the total amount of watermelon for the adults is:
\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

Each kid's slice is \( x \) and there are 4 kids, so the total amount of watermelon for the kids is:
\[ 4 \times x = 4x \]

The total amount of watermelon is the sum of the slices for the adults and the kids:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \( 4x \) out of the total \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Amount each adult gets}}{\text{Total amount of watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4x}{8x} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on checking on the inpatients.

He has 9 inpatients, and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.
So, the total time for inpatient rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the total time for inpatient rounds from minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his appointments.

He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.
So, the total time for appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert the total time for appointments from minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add up all the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total earnings from the dance studio's lessons in a month. We'll break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Cost to rent the studio: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total cost per session = $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the number of sessions in a month:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.
   - Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, the number of sessions in a month = 3 days/session * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

3. **Calculate the total earnings in a month:**
   - Total earnings = Number of sessions * Cost per session = 12 sessions * $40/session = $480

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Peter has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Martha has:

"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are in the park. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

Total population = 50
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50 = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:

Number of babies per month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

Total babies in a year = 120 * 12 = 1440

Now, we add the babies born in a year to the original population to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

Total porcupines after a year = Original population + Total babies in a year
Total porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490

So, the final numerical answer is 1490."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of gallons by $0.10 per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 7.48 to get the volume in gallons:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 1400 \times 7.48 = 10472 \]

So, the pool needs 10472 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 10472 \times 0.10 = 1047.2 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. We know there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. We know that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the final numerical answer is 34."
"First, let's calculate the distance Matteo traveled. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours

So, the distance Matteo traveled is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Shandy traveled. Using the same formula:

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours

So, the distance Shandy traveled is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students over 16 years old is \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the number of students under 16 years old is also \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \).

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students over 16 years old is \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \).

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students over 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \).

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Therefore, the number of male students under 16 years old is \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \).

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining students under 16 years old are female.
   - Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \).

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - The total number of female students is the sum of female students over 16 years old and female students under 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total number of female students is \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \).

The final numerical answer is 1875."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Total water pumped on the first day = Wanda's amount + Ms. B's amount = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

3. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Total water pumped on the second day = Wanda's amount + Ms. B's amount = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   - Total water pumped over the two days = First day's amount + Second day's amount = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

6. **Determine the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Remaining water needed = Tank's capacity - Total water pumped = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Condition**: Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. **First 5 Hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 1 hour, the charge is 91% (100% - 9%). After 2 hours, the charge is 82% (91% - 9%). After 3 hours, the charge is 73% (82% - 9%). After 4 hours, the charge is 64% (73% - 9%). After 5 hours, the charge is 55% (64% - 9%).

3. **Next 3 Hours**: After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its charge each hour. So, after 6 hours, the charge is 48% (55% - 7%). After 7 hours, the charge is 41% (48% - 7%). After 8 hours, the charge is 34% (41% - 7%).

4. **Final Condition**: After 8 hours, the charge remaining is 34%. But we know that the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%. This means that the charge after 8 hours was 28% and it lost 6% in the last hour (34% - 28% = 6%).

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 55%.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} + 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The car costs $10000, and she wants to save 20% of this cost for the downpayment. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 10000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required to save $2000 is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.5 (peaches) + $2.0 (pears) + $2.0 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After buying the fruits he has already purchased, he has:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's find out the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. So, the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. So, each friend receives:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs/friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, each friend receives:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 78 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of carrots is $120.

2. **Price after the first year**:
   - The price increases by 5% of the initial price.
   - 5% of $120 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 120 = 6 \).
   - So, the price after the first year is \( 120 + 6 = 126 \).

3. **Price after the second year**:
   - The new price is $126.
   - The price increases by 5% of $126.
   - 5% of $126 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 126 = 6.3 \).
   - So, the price after the second year is \( 126 + 6.3 = 132.3 \).

4. **Price after the third year**:
   - The new price is $132.3.
   - The price increases by 5% of $132.3.
   - 5% of $132.3 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 132.3 = 6.615 \).
   - So, the price after the third year is \( 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915 \).

5. **Rounding to the nearest integer**:
   - The price after three years, rounded to the nearest integer, is $139.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then determine how many of those were selfies and how many were portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and she put them into 8 albums. So, we can find out how many pictures are in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are for selfies and 2 of the albums are for portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

For selfies:
\[ \text{Number of selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

For portraits:
\[ \text{Number of portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ \text{Total number of selfies and portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

To simplify the multiplication:

\[ 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early. So, the number of guests left is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late. So, the number of guests left is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in. The number of guests now is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in. So, the number of guests now is:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked on each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

The total number of questions is 60. 

- 40% of the questions are easy:
  \[
  0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ easy questions}
  \]

- The rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions. So, the number of average and difficult questions combined is:
  \[
  60 - 24 = 36 \text{ questions}
  \]

- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
  \[
  \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ average questions}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ difficult questions}
  \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get correct.

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  0.75 \times 24 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ average questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ difficult questions correct}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price of a small stuffed animal:**
   Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

2. **Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**
   Since large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Define variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

4. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) dollars.
   The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is \( 12 \times x = 12x \) dollars.
   The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8x + 12x = 120
   \]

5. **Solve the equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   20x = 120
   \]
   Divide both sides by 20:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

6. **Find the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold and the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 6 = 12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with a bare hand mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf mines twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves will mine \(36 \times 40 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given prices for the other packages. We know that the prices are proportional, which means the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is the same for all packages.

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as \( x \).

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for each package:
- For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6, the price per sandwich is:
  \[
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package (with 8 sandwiches) should also be $1.5. Therefore, we can find \( x \) by multiplying the number of sandwiches in the third package by the price per sandwich:
\[
x = 8 \times 1.5 = 12
\]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst. Therefore, the number of red balloons left is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

So, 6 yellow balloons were released. Therefore, the number of yellow balloons left is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, let's calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

So, Sally added 6 blue balloons to her remaining clutch. Now, let's sum up all the balloons she carried into the school:

- Red balloons left: 15
- Yellow balloons left: 6
- Blue balloons added: 6

Total number of balloons:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Probability that the normal teacher comes in:**
   - This is 50%, or 0.5.

2. **Probability that the normal teacher gives an extension:**
   - This is 40%, or 0.4.

3. **Probability that Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate the assignment:**
   - This is 20%, or 0.2.

4. **Probability that Marcus does not have to turn in the homework:**
   - This includes two scenarios:
     - The substitute teacher comes in (50% chance).
     - The normal teacher gives an extension (40% chance).
     - Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate the assignment (20% chance).

   The probability that the normal teacher gives an extension is 40%, and the probability that Marcus convinces the teacher is 20%. So, the combined probability of these two events happening is:
   \[
   0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
   \]

5. **Probability that Marcus has to turn in the homework:**
   - This is the complement of the probability that he doesn't have to turn it in.
   - The probability that he doesn't have to turn it in is the sum of the probability that the substitute teacher comes in and the probability that the normal teacher gives an extension, which is 50% (substitute teacher) + 40% (extension) = 90%.
   - So, the probability that he has to turn it in is:
   \[
   1 - 0.9 = 0.1

"First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

So, the number of seats left for graduates and their guests is:
\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are \( n \) graduates. Each graduate would get:
\[ \frac{4750}{n} \text{ tickets} \]

However, the question does not specify the number of graduates. If we assume the number of graduates is a variable \( n \), then the number of tickets each graduate would receive is:
\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

If we assume the number of graduates is given or can be determined, we can plug in the value of \( n \) to get the exact number of tickets. But since the number of graduates is not specified in the question, the final answer in terms of \( n \) is:
\[ \frac{4750}{n} \]

If we assume the number of graduates is a specific number, for example, if there are 1000 graduates, then:
\[ \frac{4750}{1000} = 4.75 \]

So, each graduate would receive 4.75 tickets. But since the number of graduates is not specified, the final answer in terms of \( n \) is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway and then calculate the total time it will take him to place the candy in each bottle.

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.
   - To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width by the distance between each bottle:

So, Jim took out a total of $200,000 in loans.

Next, let's determine how much his income increased after college. His income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Before college, his income was $25,000 per year. During his 4 years of college, he didn't work, so he lost $25,000 per year in income. The total income he lost is:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover both the loan repayment and the lost income. The total amount he needs to earn is the sum of the loan amount and the lost income:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Jim's new income after college is $75,000 per year. To find out how many years it will take him to earn $300,000 at this new income level, we divide the total amount he needs to earn by his new annual income:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school. 

The final numerical answer is 4 years."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric Jim needs to buy. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to calculate the area of one piece of fabric. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Adding 17 to this, we get \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Adding 5 to this, we get \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters
   - Wednesday: 209 letters
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \) letters

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person. So, the total cost for the chicken salad is:

\[ 10 \text{ people} \times \$6.50 \text{ per person} = \$65.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person. So, the total cost for the pasta salad is:

\[ 6 \text{ people} \times \$6 \text{ per person} = \$36.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total amount Molly will pay:

\[ \$65.00 + \$36.00 = \$101.00 \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:

\[ \boxed{101} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - So, Johnny's dad lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Rounding to two decimal places, the average amount lost per race is \(7.17\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[7.17\]"
"To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Here's the calculation:

- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people in each city = 1000

Total number of people = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city

Let's do the multiplication:

Total number of people = 26 × 5 × 1000

First, multiply 26 by 5:

26 × 5 = 130

Then, multiply the result by 1000:

130 × 1000 = 130,000

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they divided is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we subtract 240 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"First, let's determine how many days the painters worked in total. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days they worked is:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each day they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. So, the total number of days each painter worked is:

\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \]

To convert this into hours, we know that 1 day is equal to 24 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours each painter worked is:

\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[ \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{63 \times 3}{1} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 189 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car's price depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
- The price in 2007 is $20000.
- The price in 2008 will be $20000 * 0.79 = $15800.

Next, let's calculate the price of the car in 2009:
- The price in 2008 is $15800.
- The price in 2009 will be $15800 * 0.79 = $12522.

Finally, let's calculate the price of the car in 2010:
- The price in 2009 is $12522.
- The price in 2010 will be $12522 * 0.79 = $9830.18.

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9830.18."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we need to find out how many books are written in German. We know that 10% of the 50 books are in German. To find 10% of 50, we calculate:

\[
\frac{10}{100} \times 50 = 5
\]

So, there are 5 German books.

Now, to find out how many books are written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
20

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive to reach New York City from San Diego. The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice will still need to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate the total cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we convert the total cups of water into gallons. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. So, we divide the total cups by 16 to get the total gallons:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\), board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

"First, let's break down the costs of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: The original price was $48, but they were on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: The original price was $8, but with a $2 off coupon, the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Tank top: $10
Running shorts: $15
Tennis shoes: $24
Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you first need to know the area of each tile. Since each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, the area of each tile is:

\[ \text{Area of each tile} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} = 1\, \text{ft} \times 1\, \text{ft} = 1\, \text{SqFt} \]

Now, to find out how many tiles you need to cover the entire kitchen floor, you divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the kitchen floor}}{\text{Area of each tile}} = \frac{200\, \text{SqFt}}{1\, \text{SqFt}} = 200 \]

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = 2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"First, let's find out how much the insurance cost after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. To find the increase, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased cost per month is:

\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"First, let's determine how many sets of sheets Greg needs to wash each week. He has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. Each twin bed requires 1 set of sheets, and the king size bed requires 1 set of sheets. So, the total number of sets of sheets he needs to wash each week is:

\[ 4 \text{ (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ (king bed)} = 5 \text{ sets of sheets} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry he needs to do each week. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time. Since he needs to wash 5 sets of sheets each week, we can see that he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set in one load. This means he needs to do 1 load of laundry each week.

Now, we need to calculate how many loads of laundry he does in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ 1 \text{ load/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 52 \text{ loads/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many movies Jill and her friends watch on a single day (Saturday and Sunday).

1. On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. So, on Sunday, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

Next, we calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday).

- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
- On Sunday, they watch 2 movies.
- Therefore, in one weekend, they watch \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Now, we need to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks. Since they watch 6 movies every weekend, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks.

- In 4 weeks, there are 4 weekends.
- So, in 4 weeks, they watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many stickers Leo has now, let's break down the information given:

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year (which was 50 last year).

So, this year Leo collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stickers Leo has now:

- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 100 (from two years ago) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers
- This year: 150 (from last year) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers

Therefore, the final number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all the cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams per cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount consumed per day:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. We know that Becky ate 10 slices and that she ate 3 more slices than Jake. So, we can find out how many slices Jake ate by subtracting 3 from the number of slices Becky ate:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. So, we can find out how many slices Silvia ate by multiplying the number of slices Jake ate by 2:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices they all ate by adding the slices each person ate:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). Subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs mentioned in the question:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 / 2 = $150
3. **Cost of painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 painkillers. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120
4. **Cost of parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to in a day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \]

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails a day. This means he needs to respond to the remaining emails:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 320."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes visited.

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times \frac{70}{100} = 20 \times 0.7 = 14 \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ordered. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:

\[ \text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the football team has:

\[ \text{Pizzas left by football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them. So the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them. So the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So we calculate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah originally had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures.

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser. We can find the number of trucks that successfully delivered by subtracting the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks.

\[
\text{Number of trucks that successfully delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is the number of trucks that successfully delivered multiplied by the amount of fertiliser each truck carried.

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of butter Dennis needs for 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, for 6 dozen croissants, he will need:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

Next, we need to consider the promotion at the grocery store. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound. 

To find out how much it will cost Dennis to buy 6 pounds of butter with this promotion, we can think of it in terms of the promotion's structure. For every 2 pounds, he pays for 1 pound. So, for 6 pounds, he would pay for:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 3 pounds of butter is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who couldn't come:

- Total guests who will attend: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost. The base fee for renting the theater is $125, and there's an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests.

- Additional guests beyond the initial 20: 41 - 20 = 21
- Additional cost for these guests: 21 * $6 = $126

Finally, we add the base fee and the additional cost to find the total cost:

- Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

So, the party will cost Kayla $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maggie had $60 initially.
2. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars.
3. So, Maggie has \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars left.

4. Riza also had $60 initially.
5. Riza spent one-third of her money, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars.
6. So, Riza has \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars left.

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add the amounts they each have left:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 85."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first and second monkeys eat together in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed the monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. So, in total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, Jenny needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. She has $25, so the change she should receive is:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

The florist only has quarters for change. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters Jenny will receive is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Jenny will leave with 20 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Terry makes from selling milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so:

\[ 6 \times 5.50 = 33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling burger platters. He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so:

\[ 9 \times 11 = 99.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total money he makes from selling sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so:

\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30.00 \]

Now, we add up all the money he makes from each item to find the total amount of money he makes:

\[ 33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:

\[ \boxed{162.00} \]"
"Let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves after 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves after 60 minutes, so it arrives in 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 5 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves after 65 minutes, so it arrives in 65 + 20 = 85 minutes.

Now, we need to determine how long Paul will wait for his train. Since the fourth train is the one he needs to get on, and it arrives 85 minutes after the first train leaves, Paul will wait for 85 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
85"
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
   - To find 75% of $2000, we calculate:
     \[
     0.75 \times 2000 = 1500
     \]
   - So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

2. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   - To find 120% of $1500, we calculate:
     \[
     1.20 \times 1500 = 1800
     \]
   - So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend for $1800.

3. **Calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend:**
   - The original price of the watch was $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch for $1800.
   - The discount amount is:
     \[
     2000 - 1800 = 200
     \]
   - To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 0.10 \times 100 = 10\%
     \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(10\%\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish are created by one spring in 4 hours, and then multiply that by the number of springs working together.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation by one spring:**
   - One spring creates one jellyfish every second.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, there are \( 4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400 \) seconds.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \( 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \) jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 72000 jellyfish."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **First part of the journey**: James walks halfway to the store. Halfway is half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles.
3. **Second part of the journey**: James realizes he forgot something and has to walk back home. This is another 2 miles.
4. **Total distance walked**: 2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home, which totals 4 miles.

Now, we know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him to walk 4 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved:
\[ \boxed{2} \] dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

We also know that the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out the growth rate of the crocodile per year and then use that rate to find out how much it will grow in 13 years.

First, we know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years:

\[
\text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches per year, we can calculate how much it will grow in 13 years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings from all types of bikes.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

- Total bikes sold = 300
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
- The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)
- Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times \frac{500}{2} = 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
- Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

\[ 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \]

So, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up by the truck in a 6-hour day, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
- Bales left = Bales made - Bales picked up
- Bales left = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"First, let's determine the total number of periods John has to take each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but John has to take 2 extra classes. So, the total number of periods John has each day is:

\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time John spends in class each day is:

\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

John goes to class for 5 days a week. So, the total time he spends in class each week is:

\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the total extra learning time per week is:

\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the total time John spends learning in a week, which is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time:

\[ 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 28.33 \]

Let's box the final answer:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"First, let's determine the height from which Nathan drops the ball. The third-floor balcony is 3 stories high, and each story is 24 feet. So, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When the ball bounces, it reaches 2/3 of its starting height. So, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball will again reach 2/3 of its height after the first bounce. So, the height on the second bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches to make the calculations easier. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings from selling these bags.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

So, 200 bags of apples were sold.

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples.

The final numerical answer is:
1000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \( x \) kilograms.

2. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

3. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

4. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \). Multiplying both sides by 4 gives \( x = 270 \times 4 = 1080 \).

So, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of each of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls (north and south), the total area for these walls is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of each of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls (east and west), the total area for these walls is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all the walls to get the total area that needs to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the paint. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

First, let's break down the initial conditions:
- Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.
- Her brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, let's count the total number of sodas left:
- Shaken sodas: 2
- Unshaken sodas: 6
- Total sodas: 2 + 6 = 8

Ellen's friend will get one of these 8 sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas.

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"First, let's determine the speed of each train. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, so its speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours. The distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours is:

\[ \text{Distance traveled by first train} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours is:

\[ \text{Distance traveled by second train} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:

\[ \text{Total distance apart} = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 270 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so the total number of days is:

\[ 31 \text{ (March days)} + 19 \text{ (April days)} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works on 80% of the days. To find out how many days he works, we calculate:

\[ 50 \text{ days} \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he can help in one day is:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses:

\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars:

\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:

\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for people to slide down each waterslide and then find the difference in time.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest waterslide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch time per day: 30 minutes
- Break time per day: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch per day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (break) = 60 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much time this adds up to after 5 days.

- Total time per day: 60 minutes
- Number of days: 5

Total time after 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

- Total time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After returning the item, the new balance is:
$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount:

Original price of frying pan: $20.00
Discount: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
Discounted price of frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount:

Original price of towels: $30.00
Discount: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
Discounted price of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:

New balance: $70.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00

Total cost of purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, let's add this total cost to the new balance:

New balance: $70.00
Total cost of purchases: $43.00

New balance after purchases: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. This means \( \frac{T}{15} = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( T \):
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

2. **Determine how much Lauren needs to save for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. We need to find out how much she needs to save in total.
   \[
   \text{Total savings needed} = 20,000 \times 20 = 400,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Lauren will live on each year:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

4. **Determine how much Lauren needs to save each year to cover her living expenses:**
   We need to find out how much she needs to save each year to cover her living expenses.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings needed} = 40,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save the required amount:**
   We know Lauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save $400,000, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings.
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{400,000}{20,000} = 20

"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can write this as:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times T \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Soledad needs to hike in total and then figure out how many miles she needs to hike per day to meet her goal.

First, we calculate the total number of miles Soledad wants to hike:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she plans to hike in a day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days she will be on vacation:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

So, if she hikes 250 miles per day, the total number of miles she can hike in 30 days is:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal of 9,300 miles, we subtract the miles she can hike in 30 days from her total goal:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to cover the remaining 1,800 miles in 30 days. We do this by dividing the remaining miles by the number of days:
\[ \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"First, let's determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left.

\[ \text{Money left} = \text{Budget} - \text{Money spent} \]
\[ \text{Money left} = 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna spent $4 on other items before buying the books. So, the money spent on the books is the money left minus the money spent on other items.

\[ \text{Money spent on books} = \text{Money left} - \text{Money spent on other items} \]
\[ \text{Money spent on books} = 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. To find the cost of each book, we divide the total money spent on books by 2.

\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Money spent on books}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5.

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Megan = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior did laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Dior = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 8 hours = 12 hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 4 hours, we assume the minimum is 8 hours).

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 12 hours

Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 12 hours = 22 hours.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance John drives each month when visiting his parents.

First, let's find out how long it takes John to drive one way to his parents' place. We know that it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. 

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance for one way is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{one way}} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes two round trips each month. A round trip means driving to his parents and back, so the total distance for one round trip is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{round trip}} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he makes two round trips each month, the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ \text{Total distance}_{\text{monthly}} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 560 \, \text{miles} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days:**
   - Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.
   - In 7 days, she will walk \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Relate Sofie's distance to Brian's distance:**
   - According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
   - If Sofie walks 70 miles in 7 days, then Brian will walk half of that distance.

3. **Calculate how far Brian will walk in 7 days:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Now, let's add the production rates of all four workers:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Since all four workers work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by these four workers in one shift is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they have produced 200 toys. Therefore, the number of toys still needed to be produced is:
\[ 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker needs to produce these 200 toys in the remaining time of the shift. Since the shift is 10 hours long, the fifth worker has:
\[ 10 - 10 = 0 \text{ hours} \]
left to work, which means the fifth worker must produce all 200 toys in the remaining time, which is 0 hours. This implies the fifth worker must have a production rate of:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{0 \text{ hours}} \]
which is not possible in a normal sense, but it means the fifth worker must have a production rate that allows them to produce 200 toys in the remaining time, which is effectively 200 toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker produces:
\[ 200 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's find the weight of Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dog as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's dog (one-fourth of Kory's dog)} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let's find the weight of Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog:

\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's dog (half of Kory's dog)} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}

Now, we need to find the total weight of both of Elijah's dogs:

\[
\text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 45 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to get the combined weight:

\[
\text{Total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs} = 45 \text{ pounds} + 60 \text{ pounds} = 105 \text{ pounds}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Seth originally had \( S \) stickers.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis then used half of his stickers, so he gave away \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. The stickers Luis kept were given to Kris. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 more stickers than he kept, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \). Simplifying, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
5. To find \( S \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4: \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour.

So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:

   - Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age.
   - Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - According to the problem, \( 14 = 2V \).

4. **Solve for \( V \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find Vince's age two years ago:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]

5. **Determine Vince's current age:**
   - Since Vince was 7 years old two years ago, his current age is \( 7 + 2 = 9 \).

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Arnold and Madeline each painted \( x \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted \( y \) eggs, so Camden painted \( y + 12 \) eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation:
   \[
   y + (y + 12) = 30
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2y + 12 = 30
   \]
5. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2y = 18
   \]
6. Divide by 2:
   \[
   y = 9
   \]
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.
7. Now we know:
   - Arnold and Madeline each painted \( x \) eggs.
   - Together, they painted \( 2x \) eggs.
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, which we already know.
8. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
   \[
   2x + 21 + 9 = 56
   \]
9. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 30 = 56
   \]
10. Subtract 30 from both sides:
    \[
    2x = 26
    \]
11. Divide by 2:
    \[
    x = 13
    \]
12. So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted 21 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[
21 - 13 = 8
\]

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. We do this by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per group:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each.

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find out the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes gives us the total weight:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ \text{Length of logs} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ \text{Number of planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ \text{Total money} = 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

To find the brother's salary, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money they all have together. We add up Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3-mile trail, given the distances and speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach, and it takes her 40 minutes to walk this distance, we can write the equation for her speed on the beach as:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes her to walk the 2 miles on the beach. Using her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Time on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ \text{Amount still needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount still needed by the amount she saves each week:

\[ \text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 7 blue birds each. There are 3 such trees, so:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees with 4 blue birds each. There are 2 such trees, so:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Finally, there is 1 tree with 3 blue birds, so:

\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

Now, we add up all the blue birds from each tree:

\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the current number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 of them is 26.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 26 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( x \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug decreases by 4 degrees, so the new temperature of the 33-degree mug is \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees.

Next, Donny pours 1 ounce of water from the other mug into his water bottle. This means the temperature of the water in the other mug decreases by 1 degree, so the new temperature of the other mug is \( x - 1 \) degrees.

After these actions, Donny is able to drink the water. This means the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug (which is now 29 degrees) and the temperature of the water in the other mug (which is now \( x - 1 \) degrees) must both be at least 40 degrees.

So, we need to find the minimum temperature \( x - 1 \) must be to ensure that the water in the other mug is at least 40 degrees. This gives us the inequality:
\[ x - 1 \geq 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x \geq 41 \]

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 41 degrees to allow Donny to drink the water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{41} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of cows and chickens added to the farm over three weeks.

Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. In three weeks (which is 21 days), the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. In three weeks (which is 21 days), the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens after three weeks.

The total number of cows after three weeks is:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

The total number of chickens after three weeks is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00. To find the discount amount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Each pack contains 9 bagels, and he orders 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the final total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per bagel is:
\[ 1 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we calculate:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. The number of scoops is 1 less than 3, which is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The question also states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. So we calculate:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, 18 scoops will require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days by adding the two amounts together:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 2 * Number of green jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 2 * 17
Number of red jelly beans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

Number of blue jelly beans = Total number of jelly beans - (Number of green jelly beans + Number of red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jelly beans = 9

So, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar."
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many lemons Tim gets from one tree in one year.
2. Determine how many lemons Tim gets from all five trees in one year.
3. Determine how many lemons Tim gets from all five trees in a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Tim gets 6 lemons from each tree in one year.

Step 2: Since Tim has 5 trees, the total number of lemons he gets from all trees in one year is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons/tree} \times 5 \text{ trees} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Step 3: To find out how many lemons he gets in a decade (10 years), we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many men and women are initially on the bus and then determine how many women remain after 20 women alight at the next stop.

First, let's denote the number of men as \( M \) and the number of women as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. We can express this relationship as:
\[ \frac{M}{W} = \frac{5}{9} \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ 9M = 5W \]

We also know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84:
\[ M + W = 84 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 9M = 5W \)
2. \( M + W = 84 \)

We can solve this system by expressing \( M \) in terms of \( W \) from the first equation:
\[ M = \frac{5W}{9} \]

Next, substitute \( M = \frac{5W}{9} \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{5W}{9} + W = 84 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 9:
\[ 5W + 9W = 756 \]
\[ 14W = 756 \]

Now, solve for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{756}{14} \]
\[ W = 54 \]

So, there are 54 women initially on the bus. Now, we can find the number of men by substituting \( W = 54 \) back into the equation \( M + W = 84 \):
\[ M + 54 = 84 \]
\[ M = 84 - 54 \]
\[ M = 30 \]

So, there are 30 men and 54 women initially on the bus.

Next, we need to determine how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight at the next stop:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in total over 3 days.

First, let's determine how many bouquets Faraday sold in one day. Since each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets per day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Cost of one bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:

\[
\text{Sunflowers from bouquets per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times \text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Next, we need to find out how many sunflowers were sold from the individual sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers per day, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day as follows:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers per day}}{\text{Cost of one sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by adding the sunflowers sold from bouquets and the individual sunflowers:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Sunflowers from bouquets per day} + \text{Sunflowers sold per day} = 84 + 13 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

\[
\boxed{291}

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

Adam buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. To find out how many rocks he sells, we calculate 60% of 20:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adam initially had $100. After selling 12 rocks, he has $84. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the total revenue from the initial amount:

\[
\text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Adam loses $16. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the picture scenes for the project. We can do this by calculating the number of days needed for each type of picture scene and then summing them up.

First, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days needed for large-sized picture scenes = \(\frac{45}{5} = 9\) days.

Next, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days needed for medium-sized picture scenes = \(\frac{36}{6} = 6\) days.

Finally, let's calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days needed for small-sized picture scenes = \(\frac{49}{7} = 7\) days.

Now, we sum up the days needed for all the picture scenes:
- Total number of days = 9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.

So, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is 22 days."

Next, we calculate the total time Sid traveled:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be written as \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), we multiply the probabilities of each event happening.
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.
   - \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(12\%\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) seashells.

2. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells = \( 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \) seashells.

4. **Divide the total seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Total seashells = 60.
   - Number of people = 3.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) seashells.

So, each person gets 20 seashells.

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the totals for weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots (weekdays)} + 10 \text{ carrots (weekend)} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's find out the length of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how much longer it is, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. Therefore, the length of the second song is:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount he paid, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Linus bought 2 mobile devices last Monday and 4 mobile devices last Tuesday, so he bought a total of:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ mobile devices} \]

Since he sells each mobile device for $40, the total revenue from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the mobile devices. He bought 2 devices for $20 each and 4 devices for $20 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce compared to its current daily production.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

So, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to reach 11500 bottles. Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. The additional number of bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue, and then figure out how many of those wear bows. Finally, we'll calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue. Since Carla has 8 babies and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of babies in purple} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]

The remaining 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue:

\[ \text{Number of babies in blue} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

Next, we know that all the babies dressed in blue also wear bows, so:

\[ \text{Number of babies wearing bows in blue} = 2 \]

Additionally, 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of babies wearing bows in purple} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

Now, we add the number of babies wearing bows in both colors:

\[ \text{Total number of babies wearing bows} = 2 \text{ (in blue)} + 2 \text{ (in purple)} = 4 \]

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows in purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50\% \]"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday to the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of reports:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

4. Now, let's find out how much land he has left to sell. He initially had 80 square meters and sold 40 square meters and 20 square meters:
   \[
   80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he has 20 square meters left to sell.

5. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter:
   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
   \[
   50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[

"First, let's find half the age of Haley. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age is:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Now, Geb is 10 less than this half age. So, we subtract 10 from 13:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses in one day:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - He goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
     \[
     2 \text{ masks per go out} \times 3 \text{ go outs per day} = 6 \text{ masks per day}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses in two days:**
   - Since he uses 6 masks in one day, in two days he will use:
     \[
     6 \text{ masks per day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
     \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
  \[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
  \[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
  \[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by all the people:

\[ 5 \text{ (Lamar)} + 10 \text{ (Stacy)} + 8 \text{ (Charlie)} + 4 \text{ (Mei)} = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. To find out how many apartments the third complex has, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

So, the third complex has:

\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage from 3 complexes, and each complex has 3 collections per week:

\[ 3 \text{ complexes} \times 3 \text{ collections per complex per week} = 9 \text{ collections per week} \]

Each collection involves garbage from 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments. So, the total number of apartments he collects garbage from in a week is:

\[ 9 \text{ collections per week} \times 1040 \text{ apartments per collection} = 9360 \text{ apartments per week} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 9360 \text{ apartments per week} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per apartment} = 3744 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3744} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree each year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2750
\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2750}\)."
"First, let's find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we need to add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]
\[ R = 4Y - 28 \]

Now we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the third equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let's say each of them gave the same amount of money to their little sister, say \(x\).**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money.
   - So, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\).
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\).

4. **Now, calculate how much money each of them has left after giving \(x\) dollars to their sister:**
   - Ronnie gave $3 to his sister, so he is left with \(5 - 3 = $2\).
   - Rissa gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with \(15 - 3 = $12\).

5. **The question asks for how much money is left in Ronnie's money, which we have already calculated as $2.**

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that the mural is made up of four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), and purple paint as \( P \). Since they are equal, we can say \( R = W = P \).
3. The amount of yellow paint is given as half the mural. Let's denote the amount of yellow paint as \( Y \). So, \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \) of the mural.
4. The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. This means \( R + W + P + Y = 12 \).

Since \( R = W = P \) and \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \) of the mural, we can substitute \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) in the equation. So, we have:
\[ R + R + R + Y = 12 \]
\[ 3R + Y = 12 \]

We also know that \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints. So, we can substitute \( Y \) with 6 in the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 feet by 12 feet.

\[
\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, we can find the total area of the bedrooms by multiplying the area of one bedroom by 4.

\[
\text{Total area of bedrooms} = 240 \times 4 = 960 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the living room. The problem states that the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.

\[
\text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
\]

Now, we know the total area of the bedrooms and the living room. We need to find the total area of the rest of the house, which is given as 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

\[
\text{Total area of the house} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}
\]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[
\boxed{3160}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs of clouds she counted each day:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45

"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is:
\[ 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 100 \times 0.2 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If we use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.12. So, with $1, we can run:
\[ \frac{1}{0.12} = \frac{100}{12} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \]

Since we can only run whole cycles, we can run 8 cycles with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

After that, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

When he triples this amount, he gets:

\[
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. So, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

So, the final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can use it before he has to recycle it.

First, let's find out how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. He used 45% of the chalk, and the chalk started at 5 inches. So, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:

\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

This means the chalk left after Monday is:

\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Now, the teacher uses only 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk. Let's denote the remaining chalk after Monday as \( C \). On the second day, the teacher will use:

\[ 0.20 \times C \]

After the second day, the remaining chalk will be:

\[ C - 0.20C = 0.80C \]

We need to find out how many days \( n \) it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, which is the threshold before the teacher has to recycle it. We can set up the equation for the remaining chalk after \( n \) days:

\[ C \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]

Since \( C = 2.75 \) inches, we substitute \( C \) into the equation:

\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]

To find \( n \), we need to solve for \( n \). First, divide both sides by 2.75:

\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]

\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273 \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by trial and error or by using logarithms. Let's try some values of \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \):

\[ (0.80)^1 = 0.80 \]

For \( n = 2 \):

\[ (0.80)^2 = 0.64 \]

For \( n = 3 \):

\[ (0.80)^3 = 0.512 \]

For \( n = 4 \):

\[ (0.80)^4 = 0.4096 \]

Since \( 0.4096 < 0.7273 \), the teacher will have less than 2 inches of chalk after 4 days. Therefore, the teacher has 4 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students in the class is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24

"First, let's determine how many teeth the dentist caps. We know that the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Now, we know the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{15}{30} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000
\]

So, Mr. Marcellus initially spent $14000 on the milk.

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date.

\[
\text{Amount of milk with expiry date} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons}
\]

\[
\text{Amount of milk with expiry date} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Mr. Marcellus returned this 1600 gallons of milk to the company. Now, we need to calculate the refund amount based on the cost of the returned milk.

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon}
\]

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600
\]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, let's find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 \]
\[ W = 100 + 35 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old.
Wendy's current age is 135, so in 25 years, Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \) years old.
According to the second condition, Colin's age in 25 years should be a third of Wendy's current age:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000.

To do this, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27,000. This means he can buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, Bob wants to distribute these 5400 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head. So, Newton now has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the other apple and threw it into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 + 5 = 6 apples.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put 5 in his pocket and threw the remaining 1 apple at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 6 + 6 = 12 apples.
5. Newton picked up all 12 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 12 apples.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of these 17 bags. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza. So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total. Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so the number of cheese pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. The final answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, he ran:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, he ran:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles from Tuesday and Thursday:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can actually make in an hour, considering that 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

1. In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
2. In 60 minutes (1 hour), 4 snowballs would melt (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes per 2 melted snowballs = 4).

So, in an hour, Jay can make:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs} - 4 \text{ melted snowballs} = 16 \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs.

3. We divide the total number of snowballs Jay needs by the number of snowballs he can make in an hour:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{16 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 3.75 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 3.75 hours to have 60 snowballs.

The final numerical answer is:

"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we can find Jim's age at that time by dividing John's age by 2.

So, Jim's age when the show came out was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since the question asks for Jim's current age, and no information is given about how much time has passed since the show came out, we can only determine Jim's age at the time the show came out. If we assume the show came out when John was 14 (half of his current age), then Jim was 14 years old at that time.

The final numerical answer for Jim's current age is:
14"
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate together:

Doxa: 1 slice
Sister: 2 slices
Brother: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

So, the final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had \(50\) bandages at the end of the first day.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had \(22\) bandages at the end of the second day.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages.

We are told that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered.

- They ordered 100 bandages on the third day but only used 25, so they had \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages added to their stock.
- They had 22 bandages at the end of the second day, so after ordering and using, they had \(22 + 75 = 97\) bandages.

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the problem statement. However, based on the given information and the logical steps, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 38.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:

10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40. So the total cost is:

$60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100

The final numerical answer is $100."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jen works in a week. She works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week:

\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours she works in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April:

\[ 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings from her hourly rate. Her hourly rate is $1.5:

\[ 180 \, \text{hours} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/hour} = 270 \, \text{\$} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences for April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance:

\[ 270 \, \text{\$} + 10 \, \text{\$} = 280 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the total amount Jen will receive is:

"To find out how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   - Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry.
   - He did his laundry once.
   - So, his earnings from laundry = $3.00.

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   - Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room.
   - He cleaned his room once.
   - So, his earnings from cleaning his room = $1.50.

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   - Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week.
   - He took the trash out twice.
   - So, his earnings from taking the trash out = $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   - Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.
   - He emptied the dishwasher 6 times.
   - So, his earnings from emptying the dishwasher = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
- Earnings from laundry: $3.00
- Earnings from cleaning his room: $1.50
- Earnings from taking the trash out: $1.50
- Earnings from emptying the dishwasher: $3.00

Total earnings = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After that, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. She bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of black pens Alain's mom bought. She bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens. So, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the total number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens Alain has:

"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10 \text{ bottles}} = \$60 \text{ per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \$60 \times 1.5 = \$90 \text{ per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \text{ bottles} \times \$90 \text{ per bottle} = \$1800 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day:
- He planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the first day, the total number of trees planted is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees he planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). So, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, on the second day, the total number of trees planted is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to get the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of six colors is:

"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's two-story house is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor is. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. So, we calculate the height of the first floor as:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The roof of the house is the same height as the second floor's floor, so the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 40\% \times 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total to find out how many shells are left.

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 60\% \times 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, she sold each magazine for $99.

Next, to find her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, her profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum it up for the total number of days.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed at medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed at high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum up the total water removed from all settings:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, let's calculate the total number of balloons they initially had. They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons in each pack. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 288 \]"
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose.

The first medicine is 14 mL.
The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, so it is \( 3 \times 14 \) mL.

Let's calculate the amount of the second medicine:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines:
\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

Saanvi needs 8 doses, so we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 448 \text{ mL} \]"
"First, let's find out the capacity of Ali's class. We know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find out the capacity of John's classes. We know that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, we calculate the total capacity of John's classes as:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return to his sister. He borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. 

The interest amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay in the first 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:
\[ \text{Total payment in 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount paid in the first 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:
\[ \text{Amount to be paid in the twelfth month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of diaper changes per day for Jordan's two children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for two children, the total number of diaper changes per day is:

\[ 5 \text{ (diaper changes per child)} \times 2 \text{ (children)} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes} \]

This means that the remaining diaper changes are made by Jordan. To find out how many diaper changes Jordan makes, we subtract the number of diaper changes made by his wife from the total number of diaper changes:

\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes} - 5 \text{ diaper changes} = 5 \text{ diaper changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base that is 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar based on the given efficiency. The efficiency is 80%, which means that only 80% of the volume of the jar is effectively used for packing jelly beans. So, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the number of jelly beans that can fit into the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Now, we know that 30% of these jelly beans are red. So, the number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. Therefore, the difference between Tim's guess and the true number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off in his guess. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of people who entered the bus at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **Number of people who entered the bus at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people who entered at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **Number of people who entered the bus at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people on the bus before the third stop: 90 people.
   - Number of people who entered at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the number of people who need to be removed to fill the remaining spaces is:
\[270 - 200 = 70\]

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit to the museum is $2.

2. **Increase in Cost:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. 
   - To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2 and add it to the original cost.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost = $2 + $3 = $5.

3. **Number of Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - In 5 years, she visits the museum 3 times per year for 5 years.
   - Total visits in 5 years = 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits.

4. **Total Cost for the First 5 Years:**
   - Cost per visit = $2.
   - Total cost for 15 visits = 15 visits * $2/visit = $30.

5. **Number of Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years.
   - Total visits in the next 3 years = 3 visits/year * 3 years = 9 visits.

6. **Total Cost for the Next 3 Years:**
   - Cost per visit = $5.
   - Total cost for 9 visits = 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.

7. **Total Cost for All Visits:**
   - Total cost for the first 5 years + Total cost for the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $75."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many groups of students can try the escape room and how long it will take for all of them to try.

1. First, we need to find out how many students are eligible to try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each grade and there are 3 grades (4th, 5th, and 6th), the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 30 students. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per group:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 3.75 \text{ groups}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can only form 3 full groups of 8 students each.

3. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all 3 groups to try the escape room is:
   \[
   3 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 135 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables. John made 4 wooden tables and each table costs $20. So, the total cost for the tables is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times \$20 \text{ per table} = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames. John made 2 roof frames and each frame costs $10. So, the total cost for the roof frames is:

\[ 2 \text{ frames} \times \$10 \text{ per frame} = \$20 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:

So, the final amount Ali has to pay John is:

\[ \$100 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as follows:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need for 80 meatballs.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. We know that he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, we can calculate the number of pounds of meat needed as follows:

\[
\text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of the secret seasoning is needed. Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. So, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = \text{Pounds of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width as follows:

\[ \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} \]

\[ \text{Total width} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 350 inches."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

Now, we add the costs of both parts to get the total cost.
\[
\$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00
\]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of treats needed. Since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \). According to the problem, the number of brownies she made is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes. So, the number of brownies is:
\[ 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional costs:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these two costs together to find the total cost of getting both services without any discounts or additional costs:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price for both services:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost for nail art is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the discounted price for both services to the cost of the nail art to find the total amount Karen would pay:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan gets from each magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since Susan gets 66 issues in total, and each issue comes from a different magazine, the total number of magazines she gets every year is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
2. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim.
3. Samantha has 27 paintings.

From the third point, we know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Now, we know that Shelley has 39 paintings. Since Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, we can find out how many paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's number of paintings:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 31 \]"
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

The original price of the toy in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price increased by 80% of $40.

To find 80% of $40:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{80}{100} \times 40 = 0.8 \times 40 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the price after a 50% decrease, we need to calculate 50% of $72.

To find 50% of $72:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 72 = \frac{50}{100} \times 72 = 0.5 \times 72 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a lesson given to a veteran. The fee is reduced by 25%, so the veteran's fee is 75% of the standard fee. 

To find 75% of $80:
\[ 0.75 \times 80 = 60 \]

So, the reduced fee for a veteran lesson is $60.

Now, let's calculate the total money made from the standard lessons:
\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = 4 \times 80 = \$320 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money made from the veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = 2 \times 60 = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the money made from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up all the scores.
2. Count the number of scores.
3. Divide the total sum by the number of scores.

Let's start by adding up all the scores:

\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

First, let's add the scores in pairs to make it easier:

\[ (50 + 100) + (80 + 80) + (60 + 60) + (90 + 40) + 70 \]

\[ 150 + 160 + 120 + 130 + 70 \]

Now, add these sums together:

\[ 150 + 160 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 120 = 430 \]
\[ 430 + 130 = 560 \]
\[ 560 + 70 = 630 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we find the mean by dividing the total sum by the number of scores:

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{\text{Number of Scores}} = \frac{630}{9} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she was left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

\[
\text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 of them is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. Let's calculate 25% of 36:

\[
\text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27
\]

Now, Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[
\text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many novels Regina has written this year based on the information given.

We know that the 9 novels she wrote last year are 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. Let's denote the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days and then find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this represents.

First, let's find out how many hours Michael travels in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in 72 hours at an average speed of 50 km/hr:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this 3600 km represents:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes they used:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother:

\[ 36 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

So, the number of teachers at school that day = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's do the calculation:

82 - 13 = 69
69 + 9 = 78

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 78."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese per week:
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta, cheddar cheese, and Gruyere cheese to find the total cost per week:
- Pasta costs $1.00.
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs $6.00.

Total cost per week = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
- Total cost per year = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

So, the final numerical answer is $520.00."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.

It takes 15 minutes per classroom, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours since the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. We need to find out what percentage of their 8-hour day is spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage seems unrealistic because it exceeds 100%. Let's recheck the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.

The total time spent cleaning is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours. The percentage calculation should be:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

It appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question. The custodian cannot spend more than 100% of their day cleaning. Let's rephrase the question to find the average time spent cleaning per day.

The total time required is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours. The average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \text{Average time per day} = \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the 8-hour workday spent cleaning:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that can be held by one bookcase:

- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, one bookcase can hold \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[
\frac{110}{55} = 2
\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00
\]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose bought in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Now, Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after accounting for the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Now, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. So, we can calculate the number of blue hats as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of the beef jerky bag. The original price is $18.00.

Since there is a $3.00 discount, the price Archie will pay is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Now, we know that the bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total price by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to meet the 70% requirement for both tests combined.

First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct.

\[
\text{Questions right on the first test} = 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42
\]

Next, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test to meet the 70% requirement for both tests combined. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[
70 + 40 = 110
\]

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of these 110 questions right:

\[
\text{Total questions needed right} = 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77
\]

We already know she got 42 questions right on the first test. Therefore, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:

\[
\text{Questions needed right on the second test} = 77 - 42 = 35
\]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{35}

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So we can write this as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. So we can write this as:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
   - Ara plays 40 games every year.
   - Over four years, the total number of games is \( 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \).

2. Determine the number of points Ara scores per game.
   - Ara scores 21 points per game.

3. Calculate the total number of points scored over the four years.
   - Multiply the total number of games by the points per game: \( 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} \).

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 160 \times 21 = 160 \times (20 + 1) = (160 \times 20) + (160 \times 1) \]
\[ 160 \times 20 = 3200 \]
\[ 160 \times 1 = 160 \]
\[ 3200 + 160 = 3360 \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ \boxed{3360} \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he actually had 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine how many customers Jason needs to see to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, Jason needs 2 customers.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, he needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since he can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (because even if he doesn't get a customer, he still needs to make the calls).

2. **Determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to see 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, he needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them to carry. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is:

\[ 4 \text{ (for the people)} + 2 \times 8 \text{ (for the rooms)} = 4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and the candles are divided into two groups: 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms. Half of the rooms is:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms} \]

So, there are 4 rooms with 4 small candles each and 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each. The total number of candles is:

\[ 4 \times 4 \text{ (small candles)} + 4 \times 5 \text{ (medium candles)} = 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Now, we add the number of flashlights and candles together to find the total number of candles and flashlights used:

\[ 36 \text{ (candles)} + 20 \text{ (flashlights)} = 56 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First side**: It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.
   \[
   \text{Time for first side} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Second and third sides**: Each of these sides takes twice as long as the first side.
   \[
   \text{Time for second side} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for third side} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Fourth and fifth sides**: Each of these sides takes half as long as the first side.
   \[
   \text{Time for fourth side} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time for fifth side} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the times to find the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube.

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time for first side} + \text{Time for second side} + \text{Time for third side} + \text{Time for fourth side} + \text{Time for fifth side}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that there are 20 helmets.
2. According to the problem, the number of robots is half the number of helmets. So, if there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
3. The problem also states that the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. So, if there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using both the old and new varnishes, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Crista has 20 plants in total.
- 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
- The rest need a quarter of a cup of water each.

To find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water, we subtract the number of plants that need half a cup and 1 cup of water from the total number of plants:

\[ 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \]

So, 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants:

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups} \]

3. For the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add up the total amount of water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the main phone:**
   - The main phone costs $20.

2. **Determine the cost of each additional phone:**
   - The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.
   - Let the cost of each additional phone be \( x \).
   - Therefore, \( 2x = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - So, each additional phone costs $10.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the additional phones:**
   - There are 4 additional phones (since there are 5 phones in total and 1 is the main phone).
   - The cost of each additional phone is $10.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the 4 additional phones is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost of the whole phone plan:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the previous rate, so \(60 \times 4 = 240\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(240 \div 2 = 120\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. Since 120 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds, a quarter of that number is:
\[120 \div 4 = 30\]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[440 + 30 = 470\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[470\]"
"First, let's determine how many cups of lemon juice Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts and 1 quart is equal to 4 cups, 1 gallon is equal to 16 cups. Therefore, 4 gallons of lemonade will be:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 64 \text{ cups} \]

According to the recipe, 1 cup of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice. So, for 64 cups of lemonade, Tim will need 64 cups of fresh lemon juice.

Next, we need to figure out how many lemons are required to get 64 cups of lemon juice. We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Therefore, to get 64 cups of juice, Tim will need:

\[ 64 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 384 \text{ lemons} \]

However, Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means Tim needs to make an additional 16 cups of lemon juice (since 1 gallon = 16 cups). For this extra tart lemonade, Tim will still need 16 lemons because the tartness does not affect the amount of lemons needed per cup of juice.

So, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:

\[ 384 \text{ lemons} + 16 \text{ lemons} = 400 \text{ lemons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds, so the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs, so the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both types of dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

Next, we need to find out how much dog food is needed for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
- Total weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day \(\times\) 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together to get the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

So, the final numerical answer is 40 pairs."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(x\).

The total number of blocks is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + x \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[4 + 8 + x = 32\]
\[12 + x = 32\]
\[x = 32 - 12\]
\[x = 20\]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final numerical answer is:
20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled and then determine how far he is from his house.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find out how far Elvis is from his house. Since he drove west first and then east, we need to consider the net distance traveled:
- Distance traveled west: 90 miles
- Distance traveled east: 144 miles

The net distance from his house is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year. Let's start with the initial value of the boat, which is $9000.

### First Year Depreciation
The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year. To find the value after the first year, we calculate 30% of $9000 and subtract it from the original value.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 9000 = 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700 \]

So, the value after the first year is:

\[ 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \]

### Second Year Depreciation
In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30% from its value after the first year, which is $6300.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 6300 = 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890 \]

So, the value after the second year is:

\[ 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \]

### Third Year Depreciation
In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% from its value after the second year, which is $4410.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 4410 = 0.20 \times 4410 = 882 \]

So, the value after the third year is:

\[ 4410 - 882 = 3528 \]

### Final Answer
The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each color of Starbursts candies and then find out how many are pink.

1. **Red Candies:**
   - Given: 54 red candies.

2. **Orange Candies:**
   - Given: Twice the amount of red candies.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) orange candies.

3. **Yellow Candies:**
   - Given: Half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Now, we know the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
- Red: 54
- Orange: 108
- Yellow: 27

Next, we need to find the number of pink candies. We know the total number of candies is 232. We can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

4. **Total Number of Candies:**
   - Given: 232

5. **Number of Pink Candies:**
   - Calculation: \( 232 - (54 + 108 + 27) \)
   - Calculation: \( 232 - 189 = 43 \)

So, the number of pink candies is 43.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that each bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = \frac{10}{100} \times 80 = 0.1 \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, Helen rode the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus trips is:

\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

Finally, to find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$296 \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can find out how many he had initially by adding the 4 marbles he dropped back to his final count:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

So, Dallas initially had 25 marbles.

Mazie started with 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. To find out how many marbles Dallas received from Mazie, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas had initially from the number he had after receiving more marbles:

\[ 25 - 25 = 0 \]

This means Dallas received 0 marbles from Mazie. Since the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla must add up to 52, and Dallas received 0 marbles, Darla must have received all 52 marbles minus the 0 marbles Dallas received:

\[ 52 - 0 = 52 \]

Therefore, Darla received 52 marbles.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:

\[32 + 6 = 38\] dollars.

So, the total amount they pay is \(\boxed{38}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children together.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Now, we add these weights together to get the total weight:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 1600 = \frac{1}{100} \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can calculate the average age. The formula for the average of two numbers is:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Substituting the ages we have:

Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

So, the average of their ages is 48 years."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption for all pigs is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds}

"First, we need to find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs, so:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so we subtract these from the total needed:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, so we divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find the total cost:

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he gets $6 for each week he completes his chores, we can calculate his total allowance as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan wants to go to the movies and the tickets cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \text{ dollars} \div 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole tickets, we take the integer part of the division result. Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent. She bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. So, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 100 + 100 = 230 \]

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 335 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
  \[
  1.5 \times 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
  \[
  2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of ingredients for one jar:
\[
12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling one jar. Each jar is sold for $50.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the revenue:
\[
50 - 44 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find the profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
\[
6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8.00

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6.00

4. **Pennies:**
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
- Total value = $8.00 (quarters) + $9.50 (dimes) + $6.00 (nickels) + $7.50 (pennies)
- Total value = $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent.

She spent:
- $3.50 on ice cream
- $7.50 on a movie ticket for herself
- $7.50 on a movie ticket for her younger sister
- $8.50 on a bracelet

So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 3.50 + 7.50 + 7.50 + 8.50 \]

Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[ 3.50 + 7.50 = 11.00 \]
\[ 11.00 + 7.50 = 18.50 \]
\[ 18.50 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

So, Janet spent a total of $27.00.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after spending $27.00 from her initial $40.00.

Subtract the total spent from the initial amount:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh works in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. So, he works on 7 days - 2 days = 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are 15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week.

Finally, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2: $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

So, the final numerical answer is $120."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Randy had initially:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Then, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Finally, let's add up all the cookies he has now:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's determine how many toy soldiers are in each half of Matthew's collection. Since he has 12 unique toy soldiers, half of his collection would be:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, he has 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers that he can sell for $7 each.

Now, let's calculate the total money he would earn from selling the 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total money he would earn from selling the other 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:

\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total money he would earn:

\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 72 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate returns, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average each year. We know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.

Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students. So, we calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
\]

To find \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \), we can break it down:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = \frac{3 \times 4000}{4} = \frac{12000}{4} = 3000
\]

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students each year.

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School enrollment} - \text{Butler High School enrollment}
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many test tubes and Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes} \]

Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than the requested number:
\[ 14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes} \]

Next, we know Igor picked up the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
\[ 8 \text{ test tubes} + 16 \text{ Petri dishes} + 7 \text{ beakers} = 31 \text{ items} \]

We are given that the total number of items placed on the lab bench was 29. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket has:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ eggs} \]

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's money} = \text{Alexandra's money} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Maryam raised $300. So:
\[ \text{Maryam's money} = \text{Sarah's money} + 400 = 300 \]
\[ \text{Sarah's money} = \text{Maryam's money} - 400 = 300 - 400 = -100 \]

It seems there is an inconsistency here because Sarah cannot raise a negative amount of money. Let's recheck the information given. If Maryam raised $300 and that is $400 more than Sarah, then:
\[ \text{Sarah's money} = \text{Maryam's money} - 400 = 300 - 400 = -100 \]

Since a negative amount doesn't make sense in this context, let's assume there might be a typo and recheck the problem statement. If we assume the correct information is that Maryam raised $700 (which is $400 more than $300), then:
\[ \text{Sarah's money} = \text{Maryam's money} - 400 = 700 - 400 = 300 \]

Now we have:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300

To find the total amount of money raised by all of them, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Alexandra's money} + \text{Kim's money} + \text{Sarah's money} = 430 + 750 + 300 = 1480 \]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ \boxed{1480} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Let's say Aaron's speed is \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per minute.

2. **Determine the distance Vanessa ran:**
   - We know Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \) miles per minute, the time it took her to run 4 miles can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{v}{2} \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{v} = \frac{8}{v} \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - We know Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
   - Since Aaron's speed is \( v \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \times 16 = 16v \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Relate the distances:**
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Therefore:
     \[
     4 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 16v \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     4 = 32v
     \]
     \[
     v = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Calculate Vanessa's time:**
   - We already found that Vanessa's time to run 4 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{8}{v} = \frac{8}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"First, let's calculate how much line the caretaker needs for the current dock. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more line he needs to buy. He already has 6 feet of new line, so the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the total number of feet of line he needs to buy is:

\[ 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 594 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes from one reservation:

- They order 2 meals that cost $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total cost for one reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, since they get 6 reservations a night, the total revenue from one night is \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue for the week is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's find out the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

To calculate the profit, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Cost Price} = \$80 \]
\[ \text{Profit Percentage} = 25\% = 0.25 \]

So, the profit is:
\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = \$20 \]

The total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = \$100 \]

Now, to find out the selling price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = \$2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$2 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old now.
4. James is currently 18 years old, and he is 19 years older than his father John, so John is \(18 - 19 = -1\) years old, which is incorrect. Let's correct this: John is 19 years older than James, so John is \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old now.
5. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old now.
6. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane after an hour:
- Ana has peeled 20 oranges.
- Jane has peeled 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, the final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

To find 80% off, we calculate:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \]

So, the discounted price of the radiator is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The cost for the mechanic's labor is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( h \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4h = 70 \) (since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2h = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + h = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2h = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2h - c - h = 15 \]
\[ h = 15 \]

Now that we know \( h = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens. To verify, we can check the total number of legs:
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- The total number of legs is \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given information.

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, we need to find out the total number of slices of pizza. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
