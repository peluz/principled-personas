"First, let's determine the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day. According to the problem, the ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet eats for breakfast. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs remaining after breakfast is:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Janet also bakes muffins using 4 eggs per day. Therefore, the number of eggs remaining after baking muffins is:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market. Janet sells each fresh egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Identify the amount of blue fiber needed:
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. Determine the amount of white fiber needed:
   - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt.

3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber needed:
   - Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together.
   - Total bolts = 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. Josh invests $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost before the increase is:
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]
3. The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
   \[
   150\% \times 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000
   \]
4. Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:
   \[
   130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000
   \]
5. Josh sells the house for the new value of $325,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:
   \[
   325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000
   \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[
\boxed{195000}
\]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one session (3 sprints):**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs. Therefore, the total distance for one session is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week. Therefore, the total distance for one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Thus, the total number of meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
2. Determine the total amount of feed given to the entire flock in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract this amount from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, let's find the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
- In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock. Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the glasses in pairs:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- And so on...

We can see that the cost pattern for every second glass is $3, and the cost for the first glass is $5. Therefore, for every two glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times 8 \text{ dollars per pair} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships.

1. **Number of sheep in Seattle:**
   \[
   \text{Seattle} = 20 \text{ sheep}
   \]

2. **Number of sheep in Charleston:**
   According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]

3. **Number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

4. **Total number of sheep in all three cities:**
   We sum the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse.
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Seattle} + \text{Charleston} + \text{Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla takes to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the time to download the first 80 GB:**
   Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute. Therefore, the time to download the first 80 GB is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Account for the 20-minute Windows update delay:**
   During this 20-minute delay, Carla does not make any progress on the download.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   After the delay, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The remaining file size is 120 GB. The time to download the remaining 120 GB is:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Sum up the total time:**
   The total time for the download is the sum of the time to download the first 80 GB, the delay time, and the time to download the remaining 120 GB:
   \[
   40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"First, let's break down John's journey into segments and calculate the distance he covers in each segment.

1. **Initial 3 hours at 60 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **2 hours of standstill traffic:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Next 0.5 hours at 30 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Remaining 3.5 hours at 80 mph:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 3.5 \, \text{hours} = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 0 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 280 \, \text{miles} = 475 \, \text{miles}
   \]

John initially drove 180 miles to the point where he turned around. Therefore, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[
\text{Distance from home} = 475 \, \text{miles} - 180 \, \text{miles} = 295 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{295}

"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Calculate the regular hours and the overtime hours:**
   - Regular hours: 40 hours
   - Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

2. **Calculate the pay for the regular hours:**
   - Regular hourly rate: $10
   - Pay for regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

3. **Calculate the overtime pay rate:**
   - Overtime pay rate: 1.2 times the regular hourly rate
   - Overtime hourly rate: 1.2 * $10 = $12

4. **Calculate the pay for the overtime hours:**
   - Overtime pay: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

5. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - Total earnings: Pay for regular hours + Pay for overtime hours
   - Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for the week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. To find 30% of 180, we calculate:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   We sum the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

Annual revenue from lemons:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of watering and feeding the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit/year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year} \]

Carlos needs to cover the initial planting cost of $90 before he starts earning money. We need to find the number of years \( n \) it takes for the net profit to accumulate to at least $90.

We set up the equation:
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos at least 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \(\frac{x}{3}\) vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. After selling \(\frac{x}{3}\) vacuum cleaners, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\) vacuum cleaners left.
4. After selling 2 more vacuum cleaners, she had \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2\) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
6. After selling \(\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners, she had \(\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
7. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
8. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
9. Next, we isolate the term with \( x \) by adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
10. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
    \[
    x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18
    \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students:

\[ 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item under the given market conditions and then find the difference between the future values.

First, let's calculate the future value of the jewelry:
- Current value of jewelry: $5,000
- Market increase for jewelry: 2.5%

The future value of the jewelry can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Future value of jewelry} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the future value of the electronic gadgets:
- Current value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Market increase for electronic gadgets: 1.2%

The future value of the electronic gadgets can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Future value of electronic gadgets} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we need to determine the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry: \(5125 - 5000 = 125\)
- Profit from electronic gadgets: \(8096 - 8000 = 96\)

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit. Therefore, the maximum profit is:
\[
\boxed{125}
\]"

1. **Traveling westward:**
   - Distance covered westward: 80 miles

2. **Traveling northward:**
   - Distance covered northward: 150 miles

Now, we sum these distances to find the total distance covered by each train:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance westward} + \text{Distance northward} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:

\[
\boxed{230}
\]"
"First, let's calculate Jill's annual earnings from teaching:

- Hourly wage as a teacher: $20
- Hours worked per week as a teacher: 35
- Weeks worked per year as a teacher: 50

Annual earnings from teaching = Hourly wage as a teacher * Hours worked per week as a teacher * Weeks worked per year as a teacher
= $20 * 35 * 50
= $35,000

Next, let's calculate Jill's annual earnings from being a cheerleading coach:

- Hourly wage as a cheerleading coach: $30
- Hours worked per week as a cheerleading coach: 15
- Weeks worked per year as a cheerleading coach: 50

Annual earnings from cheerleading coaching = Hourly wage as a cheerleading coach * Hours worked per week as a cheerleading coach * Weeks worked per year as a cheerleading coach
= $30 * 15 * 50
= $22,500

Now, let's add the annual earnings from both jobs to find Jill's total annual salary:

Total annual salary = Annual earnings from teaching + Annual earnings from cheerleading coaching
= $35,000 + $22,500
= $57,500

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses per week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: Over 4 weeks, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking.
2. Determine the total distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the remaining distance she needs to walk.
4. Determine the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
\]

Rearranging this formula to solve for total time, we get:

\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles. So, the time she has already spent is:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the remaining time she has to walk the remaining distance is:

\[
3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Next, we need to determine the remaining distance. The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is:

\[
12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we need to find the speed required to walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour. The speed is given by:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine how much water is in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink.
2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.
3. Determine the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink after spilling one liter of the orange drink.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water. Therefore, the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink is:
\[
10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water. Therefore, the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
\[
15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink after spilling one liter of the orange drink.**

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, we have 9 liters of orange drink left. The total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[
\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{3}}
\]"
"First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently:

\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, the number of years ago when Raymond's son was born is:

\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years ago} \]

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to break down the sales by each group of customers:

1. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD. So, the number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3
   \]

2. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs. So, the number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

3. The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs. So, the number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   3 \times 0 = 0
   \]

Now, we sum the DVDs sold to all the customers:
\[
3 + 4 + 0 = 7

"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The burning time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ centimeters/hour} = 8 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since a 25% discount means the customer pays 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. This can be written as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of clothing Mishka bought:

1. **Shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts: \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

2. **Pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants: \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

3. **Shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes: \( 3 \times 42 = 126 \) dollars.

Next, we sum the total costs for all the clothing items:

\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243
\]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of \(\boxed{243}\) dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period she is buying ice cream.

\[
\text{Total servings} = 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream.

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip is 60 miles, the distance to the end of the trip is 60 miles. Therefore, the distance to the second stop is:

\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Henry first stopped after 20 miles. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance to his second stop:

\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average of these guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \). So, the second friend's guess is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \( \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 20 \). So, the third friend's guess is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

The sum of the guesses is \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \).

The average guess is \( \frac{240}{3} = 80 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]"
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the total hours John spends on one dog per day:
   \[
   \text{Hours per dog per day} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per day:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per day} = 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours per dog} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Calculate the total hours John spends on all 10 dogs per week:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = 5 \text{ hours per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 35 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the first equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats over 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days is:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This will help us determine how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy. We do this by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \]

Since each pack of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 packs is:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

Therefore, the amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games, each costing $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the problem states that John has $5 left, we can verify the calculation:

\[
35 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

This confirms that the calculations are consistent. John started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them. Therefore, he still has:

\[
\boxed{13}
\] Lego sets."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total running time per week.
2. Calculate the total distance run in those hours.
3. Determine the speed by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, we know John runs 3 days a week and the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, on the second and third days, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

The total running time per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} + 1.5 \text{ hours/day} + 1.5 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total distance run in those 6 hours is 60 miles. To find the speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John's running speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we need to break down her time spent running and walking, and then calculate the distance she covers during each activity.

First, we know that Dana skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can find her running speed:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. The total time is six hours, so we calculate the time spent running and walking:
\[
\text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking}
\]

To find the walking speed, we need to determine how fast she walks. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:
\[
\text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while walking:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, we add the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Suzy's iPhone:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The great dragon, Perg, breathes fire within a distance of 1000 feet from its location. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of \(5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces}\) of apple pie.

The final numerical answer is 26."
"First, let's determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings and contains 250 calories per serving, we can confirm the total calories in the bag:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume to meet your daily target of 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 250 calories:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300 grams, we can calculate the grams you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 300 \text{ grams/serving} = 240 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \text{ grams} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for every 10 candles. Since he wants to make 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is the cost of the beeswax and wicks, which is $20.00. Therefore, the net profit is:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Determine the initial number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package.
3. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the new package.

First, we know that Candice used 220 Post-it notes at work. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \). After purchasing the package, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package was \( 80 + x \).

The equation representing the total number of Post-it notes she had initially and the number she used is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we add 140 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

With the cost of each red tie being $60, we can now calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd's chickens produce per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:

\[
\frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen}
\]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[
21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[
42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week}
\]

Thus, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled to his destination. However, the problem does not specify the distance. Let's denote the distance from his starting point to the destination as \( d \) miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The time \( t_1 \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t_1 = \frac{d}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After reaching the destination, Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \( t_2 \) it takes to return can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t_2 = \frac{d}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time \( T \) for the round trip is the sum of \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \):
\[ T = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. So we rewrite the fractions:
\[ \frac{d}{10} = \frac{3d}{30} \]
\[ \frac{d}{6} = \frac{5d}{30} \]

Adding these fractions gives:
\[ T = \frac{3d}{30} + \frac{5d}{30} = \frac{8d}{30} = \frac{4d}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( d \), the time it takes Tom to get back in terms of \( d \) is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4d}{15} \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires.
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\).
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\).
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\).

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\).
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480\).

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Revenue on Thursday: \$520
- Revenue on Friday: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[
\$520 - \$480 = \$40
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on the day with higher revenue."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of adopted kittens from the local animal shelter.
2. Determine the number of kittens Patchy had.
3. Determine the number of kittens Trixie had.
4. Sum up all the kittens.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of adopted kittens is 7.
- Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie had 12 kittens.

First, calculate the number of kittens Patchy had:
\[ \text{Number of kittens Patchy had} = 3 \times \text{Number of adopted kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we know Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, sum up all the kittens:
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = \text{Number of adopted kittens} + \text{Number of kittens Patchy had} + \text{Number of kittens Trixie had} \]
\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:

\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \text{ lollipops} \]

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:

\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \]

So, Jean can fill 14 bags.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one visit to the movies. 

Peter's expenses for one visit include:
- A ticket for $7
- Popcorn for $7

The total cost for one visit is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Peter can go to the movies with his total budget of $42. We do this by dividing his total budget by the cost per visit:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his budget of $42.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total weight limit of the bridge.
2. Determine the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
3. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
4. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding the remaining weight capacity.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity of the bridge is:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{1245}{15} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 83 \right\rfloor = 83 \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:
\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for all the additional fees and the tip he added. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Total Cost**: The initial cost of the groceries is $40.00.
2. **Delivery Fee**: The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the initial total.
   \[
   \text{Delivery Fee} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
   \]
3. **Additional Delivery Fee**: The delivery vendor also charged an additional $3.00 in delivery fees.
   \[
   \text{Total Additional Fees} = 10 + 3 = 13
   \]
4. **Tip**: Stephen added a $4.00 tip.
   \[
   \text{Total Additional Fees Including Tip} = 13 + 4 = 17
   \]
5. **Final Price**: The final price is the initial total cost plus the total additional fees.

\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush:

\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ individual raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:

\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of unripe oranges. Since 20% of the 25 oranges are unripe, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Next, we know there are 2 sour oranges. Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of unripe, sour, and bad oranges from the total number of oranges:

\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - (\text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges} + \text{Bad oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (5 + 2 + 1) \]
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from the brownies and the cheesecakes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars per brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \text{ cheesecakes} \times 4 \text{ dollars per cheesecake} = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88.00}\)."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's denote the square footage of each level as follows:
- Level 4 (top level): \( S_4 = 16 \)
- Level 3: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
- Level 2: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)
- Level 1: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \)

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 128
- Level 2: 64
- Level 3: 32
- Level 4: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Sum of square footages} = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4
\]

\[

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the number of games they won is 8 more than the number of games they lost, so we can denote the number of games they won as \( W = L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting \( W = L + 8 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost is 7, we can find the number of games they won:
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is \( 15 \).

\(\boxed{15}\)"

"Let's denote the number of times the alarm rang the first time as \( A_1 \), the second time as \( A_2 \), and the third time as \( A_3 \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_1 = 4 \) (the first time it went off, it rang 4 times)
- \( A_2 = 3 \times A_1 \) (the second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time)
- \( A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times A_2 \) (the third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time)

First, we calculate \( A_2 \):
\[
A_2 = 3 \times A_1 = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

Next, we calculate \( A_3 \):
\[
A_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
\]

Now, we sum the total number of times the alarm rang:

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
H + 10H = 88,000
\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[
11H = 88,000
\]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000
\]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. 

To find out how many guests don't show up, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ guests}
\]

So, the number of guests who will attend is:
\[
16 - 4 = 12 \text{ guests}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of gift bags needed. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:
\[
0.75 \times 12 = 9 \text{ gift bags}
\]

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[
9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to determine the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat. Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adults. Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:

\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, we need to determine the amount of potato salad that the children will eat. Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

To find the total amount of potato salad that Ted needs to bring, we add the amounts for the adults and the children:

"Let's define the ages of the kids using variables:
- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Then Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
- Corey's age is \( J + 5 + 2 = J + 7 \).
- James' age is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Since Corey's age is \( J + 7 \) and we know Corey's age is 11, we can set up the equation:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Calculate Lee's original speed:**
   Since Lee's time is 38 seconds, his speed \( S_L \) is:
   \[
   S_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine the original time for Gerald:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time \( T_G \) was:
   \[
   T_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate Gerald's original speed:**
   Using Gerald's original time, his speed \( S_G \) is:
   \[
   S_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   Gerald's speed improved by 10%. Therefore, his improved speed \( S_G' \) is:
   \[
   S_G' = S_G + 0.10 \times S_G = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 1 \text{ meter/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's improved time:**
   Using his improved speed, Gerald's new time \( T_G' \) to run the 400-meter hurdles is:
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36.36}

"Let's denote the number of dogs as \( D \), the number of cats as \( C \), and the number of rabbits as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C \) is two times the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D \).
- The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
\[ D + C = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Now, calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

Finally, calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
\[ \text{Total pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[ \boxed{348} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is:
     \[
     32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Convert the volume of tomatoes to the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces, we divide:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit.

The total number of cars originally on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is the original number minus the cars that drove through and the cars that took an exit.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \).

"First, we need to determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[
2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
\]

Next, we account for the new potted plants she received from the nursery:

\[
80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
\]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[
1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
\]

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has:

\[
98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}

- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday and then find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

First, let's break down the hours watched each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's sum up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the number of hours he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ x + 15 \]

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:

\[ (x + 15) - 5 = x + 10 \]

We are given that after dropping 5 cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

"First, we need to determine how many seconds it takes Julia to row one foot. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the time it takes her to row one foot is:

\[
\frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = 0.8 \text{ seconds per foot}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Julia can row in 64 seconds. Using the rate of 0.8 seconds per foot, the number of feet she can row in 64 seconds is:

\[
\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{0.8 \text{ seconds per foot}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rows. Therefore, the amount of water the boat takes on for 80 feet is:

\[
\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lessons the whiteboard is used in a day.
2. Determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in each lesson.
3. Multiply the total number of lessons by the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

First, we know that there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. Therefore, the total number of lessons the whiteboard is used in a day is:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. Therefore, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and it can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1800 = 6 \times \text{(number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold)}
   \]
   Solving for the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
   \[
   \text{(number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold)} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   300 = \text{(number of birds in Jamal's photograph)} \times 50
   \]
   Solving for the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:
   \[
   \text{(number of birds in Jamal's photograph)} = \frac{300}{50} = 6
   \]

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has.

1. **Cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Each board costs $10.
   - Total cost for 10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Each board costs $16.
   - Total cost for 5 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber. Since the problem does not specify the selling price per board, we assume the selling price is the same as the cost price (which is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).

3. **Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Each board is sold for $10.
   - Total revenue from 10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100 \).

4. **Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Each board is sold for $16.
   - Total revenue from 5 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80 \).

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$180 - \$180 = \$0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \( S \) and the number of cups of water as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which can be written as:
\[
\frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13}
\]

We are also given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons and cups of water. Therefore, we have:
\[
S + W = 120
\]

Using the ratio \(\frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13}\), we can express \( S \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
S = \frac{7}{13}W
\]

Substitute \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \) into the equation \( S + W = 120 \):
\[
\frac{7}{13}W + W = 120
\]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{7W}{13} + \frac{13W}{13} = 120
\]

Combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{7W + 13W}{13} = 120
\]
\[
\frac{20W}{13} = 120
\]

To solve for \( W \), multiply both sides by 13:
\[
20W = 120 \times 13
\]
\[
20W = 1560
\]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[
W = \frac{1560}{20}
\]
\[
W = 78
\]

Now, substitute \( W = 78 \) back into the equation \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \) to find \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{7}{13} \times 78
\]
\[
S = 7 \times 6
\]
\[
S = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:
\[
\boxed{42}

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.**

Initially, 2 containers were imported, and each container had 5 vehicles.
\[
2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.**

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[
30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.**

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[
\frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
\]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
   - Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as \( L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Given that \( 1.3L = 40000 \), we solve for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{40000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
     \]

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%.
   - Let \( A_{\text{new}} \) be Adrien's new salary.
   - Therefore, \( A_{\text{new}} = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - Let \( L_{\text{new}} \) be Lylah's new salary.
   - Therefore, \( L_{\text{new}} = 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
   - Total salary = \( 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \).

Thus, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

2. **Tuesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Sadie slept 2 hours less than Tuesday.
   \[
   6 - 2 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Thursday and Friday:**
   For the next two days, Sadie slept 1 hour more than the previous two days combined.
   - Combined hours for Tuesday and Wednesday:

"First, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Rosie has left after running for 3 hours. Since she has a total of 7 hours available:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Remaining time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.

The number of patient hours per day is:
\[
\frac{500 \text{ patients}}{60 \text{ minutes/patient}} = \frac{500}{60} \approx 8.33 \text{ patient hours/day}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the doctors:
- The doctors charge $150 per hour.
- The total revenue from the doctors is:
\[
150 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8.33 \text{ patient hours/day} = 1249.50 \text{ dollars/day}
\]

Now, we calculate the revenue generated by the patients:
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- The total revenue from the patients is:
\[
200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8.33 \text{ patient hours/day} = 1666 \text{ dollars/day}
\]

The total revenue from both the doctors and the patients is:
\[
1249.50 \text{ dollars/day} + 1666 \text{ dollars/day} = 2915.50 \text{ dollars/day}

So, the number of pink gumballs is \( 70 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The percentage is given by the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens, so \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Thus, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we calculate the total hours per week as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Jordan would earn if he worked these 14 hours at his part-time job, where he earns $10 per hour. We calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying the number of hours he works by his hourly wage:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is:

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"First, let's identify the nonfood items and calculate the tax on them. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps.

The cost of light bulbs is $3.
The cost of roach traps is $4.

The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on each nonfood item is calculated as follows:
- Tax on light bulbs = $3 * 10% = $3 * 0.10 = $0.30
- Tax on roach traps = $4 * 10% = $4 * 0.10 = $0.40

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the nonfood items including tax:
- Total cost of light bulbs including tax = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
- Total cost of roach traps including tax = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items, which are milk and eggs:
- Cost of milk = $2
- Cost of eggs = $3

The total cost of all items before tax is:
- Total cost of milk and eggs = $2 + $3 = $5

Now, we add the total cost of the nonfood items including tax to the total cost of the food items:
- Total cost = $5 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $12.70

Therefore, the final total cost is:
\[
\boxed{12.70}
\]"
"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
\[ 3 \text{ (current clients)} + 5 \text{ (potential clients)} = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths for all clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of one pack of cloths is $5.

The cost for one client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since there are 8 clients, the total expenses are:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. Therefore, the profit is the total income minus the total expenses:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

So, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the result by the number of hectares John has.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many 3-month periods there are in a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples harvested per hectare per year by the number of hectares John has:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one. Therefore, the number of pieces in the second set is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set. Therefore, the number of pieces in the third set is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, if Johnny picks up all the legos, he picks up a total of:
\[
\boxed{2125}
\]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there are 0 bees in the hive. After 30 bees leave and 15 bees return, the hive has:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Since the number of bees cannot be negative, we assume the hive is empty at this point (0 bees).

5. **Bees leaving in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 60 bees leave the hive, so the hive is now:
   \[
   0 - 60 = -60 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Again, assuming the hive is empty, we have 0 bees.

6. **Bees returning in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before returns to the hive. The total number of bees that left before is:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Therefore, in the last 6 hours, all 90 bees return to the hive.

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

First, let's find the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of a child ticket is $10.

Adding these together gives the total cost for one adult and one child:
\[
12 + 10 = 22
\]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change:
\[
22 + 8 = 30
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[
\text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends}
\]

\[
12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends}
\]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
\text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
\]

Next, we need to determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can calculate the number of James's friends as follows:

\[
\text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends}
\]

\[
\text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of James's Facebook friends is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each person to travel their respective distances.

Time for Steve to bike home:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

Time for Tim to skateboard home:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to reach home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to reach home. The difference in their travel times is:
\[
40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles, so there are \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 10 tires is \(10 \times 25\) cents.

\[
10 \times 25 = 250 \text{ cents}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- On the first day, 3 people came with tricycles, so there are \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 9 tires is \(9 \times 25\) cents.

\[
9 \times 25 = 225 \text{ cents}
\]

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- On the first day, 1 person came with a unicycle, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire to inflate.
- The cost for inflating 1 tire is \(1 \times 25\) cents.

\[
1 \times 25 = 25 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we sum up the total cost in cents:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[
500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount Shawnda made that day is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars per cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

\[
10 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Let's work backwards from the final number of fries to find out how many were in the pack initially.

1. After the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, five fries were left. This means that the five fries represent one third of the fries that were left before the raccoon stole them. Therefore, before the raccoon stole the fries, there were \(5 \times 3 = 15\) fries.
2. The three pigeons each ate three fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. This means that before the pigeons ate the fries, there were \(15 + 9 = 24\) fries.
3. Dave's friend ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate, which was 14 fries. So, before Dave's friend ate the fries, there were \(24 + 14 = 38\) fries.
4. Dave ate 14 fries, so before Dave ate the fries, there were \(38 + 14 = 52\) fries.

Therefore, the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{52}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then sum these amounts over the 16 weeks of the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one week:
- The total number of hours per week is the sum of the hours on the three days and the two days, which is \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[17 \times 16 = 272\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - First, convert feet to inches: \( 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \).

Next, we sum the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \].

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet} \].

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

"To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes (monkeys, gorillas, and baboons) over that period.

First, let's calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Next, we find the total monthly requirement for all the apes:
\[
200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month}
\]

Since the zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly requirement by 2:
\[
700 \text{ bananas per month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards per round trip. She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance run is:

\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. **Water depth on Monday:**
   The tank has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

2. **Water depth on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Water depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

   To calculate this, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Anakin's total number of fish:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Locsin's total number of fish:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Adding the totals together:
\[ 19 \text{ (Anakin's fish)} + 13 \text{ (Locsin's fish)} = 32 \text{ fish} \]

Thus, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months.
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Let \( P_n \) be the price after \( n \) increases. The price after each increase can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   P_{n+1} = P_n \times 1.20
   \]
   where \( P_0 = 20 \).

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**: The price after \( n \) increases can be expressed as:
   \[
   P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n
   \]
   Substituting \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \):
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

7. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\boxed{209.76}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. According to the problem, one red car costs $4.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since an action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we need to find the cost of one red car. The problem states that one red car costs $4, which we already know.

We also need to find the cost of the action figures. Since there are 3 action figures and each costs $5, the total cost for the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys in the room:
- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
- Doll: $15

Adding these values together gives:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90, which is less than the $105 missed income. Therefore, hiring the accountant will result in a net gain of:
\[ 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more if she hires the accountant."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- Printer: €102

Adding these together:

\[
157 + 74 + 102 + 102 = 435
\]

Next, we add the cost of the computer itself, which is €1090:

\[
1090 + 435 = 1525
\]

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

\[
1500 - 1525 = -25
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Elvira does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the accessories. She will be short by €25.

Thus, the amount of money she will have left for her clothing is:

\[
\boxed{-25}

   15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect 45 eggs.
   Since she receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, the number of babysitting sessions required is:
   \[
   \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/session}} = 5 \text{ sessions}
   \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age \( S \):
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Jimmy has based on the information given.

We know that Ethel has $8. According to the problem, Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times (\text{Ethel's money}) + 2 \]

Substituting the amount of money Ethel has into the equation:

\[ \text{Jimmy's money} = 2 \times 8 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Next, add $2 to the result:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule:

- Pancho walks 20 miles a day from Monday to Friday.
- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day.

First, calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Friday:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, calculate the total miles walked on the weekend:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, add the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of one uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost of one uniform} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"To determine the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs contributed by each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare Mutant Invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum the legs from all the creatures:
\[
640 + 540 + 30 = 1210
\]

Thus, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the birds based on the information provided:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

"First, we need to determine the minimum monthly payments for each of Jessica's debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Next, we calculate the 50% increase for each minimum payment:

- Student loans: \( 300 \times 1.5 = 450 \) dollars/month
- Credit card: \( 200 \times 1.5 = 300 \) dollars/month
- Mortgage: \( 500 \times 1.5 = 750 \) dollars/month

Now, we sum these increased monthly payments to find the total amount Jessica needs to pay each month:

\[
450 + 300 + 750 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month}
\]

To find the total amount Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

\[
1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18000}

"First, let's determine the time it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato.

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for consistency:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, calculate the total time to prep 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how much profit they made per gallon. They made a total profit of $25, and we need to determine how many gallons they sold to achieve this profit. Let \( x \) be the number of gallons they sold. The profit equation is:
\[ \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10x - \text{Cost} = 25 \]

The cost per gallon is the sum of the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon, so the total cost per gallon is:
\[ 3 + 2 = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Substituting the cost into the profit equation, we get:
\[ 10x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ 5x = 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons. Since the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

2. **Determine the number of boys and girls on the Chinese team:**
   - Number of boys on the Chinese team: 60
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of girls on the Chinese team.

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of Chinese participants:**
   - Total number of Chinese participants = Number of boys + Number of girls
   - \( 160 = 60 + G \)

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - \( G = 160 - 60 \)
   - \( G = 100 \)

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the donation to charity:**
   \[
   \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, the number of crabs Monic has is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, the number of crabs Rani has is:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has:
\[ 40 \text{ (Bo)} + 36 \text{ (Monic)} + 46 \text{ (Rani)} = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are:
  \[
  10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours in the second week.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are:
  \[
  10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum his earnings from both weeks to find the total amount he earned:
\[
50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to find out how many votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes, and the total number of votes cast was 80.

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 5w = 200 \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"First, let's determine Mark's age based on the information given.

We know that Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan's age was:
\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was:
\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \]

Since two years ago Mark was 19, his current age is:
\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is:
\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team. Each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, and there are four members.

\[
\text{Total time for the faster team} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds, the third runner takes 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds.

\[
\text{Total time for the slower team} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the total times between the two teams.

\[
\text{Difference in time} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 30 \]"
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:
\[ 3r \times 6 = 18r \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters. Then the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
\[ 10h \times 5 = 50h \]

The total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits:
\[ 18r + 50h + 20 = 160 \]

We can simplify this equation to:
\[ 18r + 50h + 20 = 160 \]
\[ 18r + 50h = 140 \]

To find the values of \( r \) and \( h \), we need to find integer solutions to this equation. We can start by isolating \( r \):
\[ 18r = 140 - 50h \]
\[ r = \frac{140 - 50h}{18} \]

For \( r \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 50h \) must be divisible by 18. We can check the values of \( h \) that satisfy this condition. Let's test some values of \( h \):

If \( h = 2 \):
\[ 140 - 50 \times 2 = 140 - 100 = 40 \]
\[ r = \frac{40}{18} \approx 2.22 \] (not an integer)

If \( h = 1 \):
\[ 140 - 50 \times 1 = 140 - 50 = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \] (an integer)

If \( h = 0 \):
\[ 140 - 50 \times 0 = 140 \]
\[ r = \frac{140}{18} \approx 7.78 \] (not an integer)

The only integer solution is \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \). Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

1. **Original Amount Owed:**
   \[
   \text{Original Amount} = \$100
   \]

2. **Monthly Interest Rate:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = 2\% = 0.02
   \]

3. **Number of Months:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Months} = 3
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Interest:**
   The interest for each month is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Interest per Month} = \text{Original Amount} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = 100 \times 0.02 = \$2
   \]
   Over 3 months, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = \text{Interest per Month} \times \text{Number of Months} = 2 \times 3 = \$6
   \]

5. **Total Amount to be Repaid:**
   The total amount Mandy needs to pay Benedict is the original amount plus the total interest:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest} = 100 + 6 = \$106
   \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict \(\boxed{106}\)."
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

First, we calculate the total cost incurred by the trader. The cost of purchasing the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the wheat. The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the number of bags the trader sold is \( \boxed{50} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of the tickets and food:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost for rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost for the rides to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. There are 7 days in a week, so the daily amount of insects needed for one duck is:
\[
\frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day}
\]

Next, since there are ten ducks in the flock, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock is:
\[
10 \text{ ducks} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} = 5 \text{ pounds per day}
\]

Thus, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year.**

Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees after 10 years without considering the trees that die.**

Tom starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, the number of trees added is:
\[ 8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees after 10 years, before any die, is:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.**

30% of the trees die after 10 years. Therefore, the number of trees that die is:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees after 10 years.**

The number of trees left after 10 years is:
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"First, let's determine the number of pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard after each event.

1. **Initial number of pink plastic flamingos:**
   \[
   18
   \]

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   \[
   \text{One third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6

"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. Since each pen costs $1.50, the cost for 8 pens is:

\[ 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants. Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each restaurant receives:

\[
40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:

\[
200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

The total population of Soda is 23786 inhabitants.
The number of men is 8417.
The number of women is 9092.

First, we calculate the total number of men and women combined:
\[ 8417 + 9092 = 17509 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:
\[ 23786 - 17509 = 6277 \]

Thus, the number of children in Soda is \(\boxed{6277}\)."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards:**
   To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we sum the cards collected each month and add the initial number of cards.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[
\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A}
\]
\[
500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B}
\]

Next, we know the rate at which Publisher A pays Mark. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:

\[
500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the rate at which Publisher B pays Mark is:

\[
2 \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
\]

Thus, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:

\[
500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
\]

To find the total amount Mark earns in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[
2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

\[
\boxed{7500}

1. Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day.
2. Convert the total number of pails into liters.

First, let's find the total number of pails of water Baldur gets in a day:
- Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning.
- Baldur gets 6 pails of water in the afternoon.
- Therefore, the total number of pails of water he gets in a day is:
  \[
  5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails}
  \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of pails into liters. We know that each pail contains 5 liters of water:
- So, the total amount of water in liters is:
  \[
  11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters}
  \]

Thus, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is:
\[
\boxed{55}

"First, let's calculate John's new salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Salary} = \text{Original Salary} + (\text{Original Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = 2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = 2000 + 100 \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = 2100 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes in a year with the new salary:

\[ \text{Total Yearly Salary} = \text{New Salary} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Year} \]
\[ \text{Total Yearly Salary} = 2100 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total Yearly Salary} = 109,200 \]

Finally, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total yearly salary:

\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = \text{Total Yearly Salary} + \text{One-Time Reward} \]
\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = 109,200 + 5000 \]
\[ \text{Total Yearly Income} = 114,200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of grapes produced by Josie's farm per year. Josie has 10 acres of land, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total production of grapes is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. We know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total production of wine barrels is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year by Josie's farm is:

\[

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - There are 5 days in a week.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.
   - He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for all the meals:
\[
10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices}
\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used in a week is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag contains 9 pens:

\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, and each bag contains 6 pens:

\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has by adding the green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens together:

\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Adding these together:

\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, the total number of pens Janet has now is:

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores required to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score needed on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the required total sum.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]
So, for an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of the six test scores is the sum of the first five scores plus the sixth score:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of \(\boxed{118}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total number of kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode, he covered 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total number of kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cakes Rose bought each day.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:

\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates is. This is calculated as:

\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

This means that twenty dozen cups cost $34800. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, we can find the cost of one cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups:

\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:

\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
Additionally, she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn by \(x\). Therefore, she earns:
\[ 4x \text{ dollars} \]
from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn and babysitting is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least equal to the cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Thus, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens in a day is \( 3r \).

Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens in a day is \( 5(r + 2) \).

The total number of eggs collected by Jerry in a day is the sum of the eggs produced by the red and white chickens, which is given as 42. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) taken to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[
t = \frac{d}{v}
\]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[
t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine the number of customers on the second day. According to the problem, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the number of customers on the first day. 

Number of customers on the first day = 100

Number of customers on the second day = 100 + 50 = 150

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can set up the equation to find the number of customers on the third day.

Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day.

Total number of customers over the three days = Number of customers on the first day + Number of customers on the second day + Number of customers on the third day

\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 250 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

\[
\boxed{250}

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:

\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:

\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:

\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

\[
\text{Number of hours} = \frac{\$352.00}{\$8.00 \text{ per hour}} = 44 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}

"First, let's determine the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. Therefore, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[
2000 + 0.10 \times 2000 = 2000 + 200 = 2200
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount paid is:

\[
165 \times 12 = 1980
\]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has actually paid. This is $1980. To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount promised:

\[
2200 - 1980 = 220
\]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of the 12 months is:

\[
\boxed{220}

"First, we determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

\[
\text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
\]

Next, we find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[
\text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the current age of Zack.
2. Determine the current age of Adrian.
3. Calculate their ages in three years.
4. Find the average of their ages in three years.

First, we know Harriet's current age is 21 years. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
\]

Next, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can find Adrian's current age as follows:
\[
\text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
\]

Now, we calculate their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Adrian's age in three years} = 63 + 3 = 66
\]
\[
\text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Zack's age in three years} = 42 + 3 = 45
\]

Finally, we find the average of their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points each of the other students scored and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi's score is given as 68 points.
2. Yuri's score is 10 more than half of Naomi's score. So, we calculate half of Naomi's score:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value to get Yuri's score:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna's score is 17 points more than Naomi's score. So, we add 17 to Naomi's score:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Now, we know the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. Let's denote Jojo's score as \( J \). The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]
6. To find \( J \), we subtract 197 from 251:
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

"First, we determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters to water her garden. The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.

\[
120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of water left in the tank is 30 liters. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[
2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
\]

We add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank to find the total amount of water now in the tank:

\[
30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank is:

2. Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.
3. Add the amounts spent in both years to find the total.

Step 1: The amount spent on advertising in the first year is given as $15000.

Step 2: The amount spent on advertising in the second year is a third of the amount spent in the first year. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

Step 3: To find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the amounts spent in each year:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Thus, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."
"First, we calculate the cost for Carlos renting the canoe. The cost is $30 per hour, and he rents it for 3 hours:

\[
30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for Benji renting the banana boat raft. The cost is $18 per hour, and he rents it for 5 hours:

\[
18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the total cost for both Carlos and Benji, we add the two amounts together:

\[
90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:

\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, the number of days to travel by car is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of days Andrew will travel if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car. The travel time for the round trip (going to Rochester by bus and returning by car) is the sum of the travel time by bus and the travel time by car:

\[
6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

He buys 14 more grass type cards:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ total cards} \]

Next, we need to find the percentage of water type cards out of the total cards. The number of water type cards is 32.

The percentage of water type cards is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{32 \times 100}{96} = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the base burrito and all the additional items Chad added:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Now, let's sum these costs:

\[
6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00
\]

Next, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for upgrading his meal:

\[
11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00
\]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:

\[
14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place pieces together.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is:
\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Next, we calculate the combined rate at which they can place pieces together:
\[
4 \text{ pieces/minute} + 2 \text{ pieces/minute} = 6 \text{ pieces/minute}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle at their combined rate of 6 pieces per minute:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}

"First, we determine the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This leaves:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons remaining. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate the number of watermelons that were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means that the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 12 cars before any taxes or registration fees. Each car sells for $20,000, so the total cost for the cars is:

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Adding the tax to the cost of the cars gives us the total cost before registration fees:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Now, we need to add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, so for 12 cars, the total registration fee is:

\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Adding the registration fees to the total cost before registration fees gives us the final amount Mark has to pay:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Mark pays is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is \(25 \times 2 = 50\).

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[

"First, we need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins jump in, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we need to determine how many penguins go into the cave. Since another one-third of the 36 penguins go into the cave, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]

So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we need to find out how many penguins are left sunbathing. Initially, there are 36 penguins. After 12 penguins jump into the ocean and 12 penguins go into the cave, the number of penguins left is:

\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine how much Steve eats per day. According to the problem, Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve eats:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

The problem states that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve needs by the number of tomatoes a single vine can produce:
\[ \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{14}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

First, we calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices:
\[
20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required. Each pizza is sold sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[
\frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens initially.

2. **Using Pens to Make New Pens:**
   Ram can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. We need to calculate how many new pens he can make from the 25 initial pens.

   - Each set of 5 empty pens can be used to make 1 new pen.
   - Number of sets of 5 pens in 25 pens: 
     \[
     \frac{25}{5} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 initial pens.

3. **Total Pens:**
   - Initial pens: 25
   - New pens made: 5
   - Total pens:
     \[
     25 + 5 = 30

"First, let's determine the number of students who went out of the building through exit A. Since 30% of the students went through exit A, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

This means that 300 students went through exit A. Therefore, the number of students remaining after exit A is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 700 students went through exit B. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went through exit B. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

This means that 420 students went through exit B. Therefore, the number of students remaining after exit B is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students, which is 280, went through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ 280 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more candies John has than James, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has:
     \[
     \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

2. **Determine the number of candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has:
     \[
     \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

3. **Calculate how many more candies John has than James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - Therefore, the difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21
     \]

Thus, John has \(\boxed{21}\) more candies than James."
"To determine the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora will read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly will read:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.
- Total books Dolly reads: \(2 + 1 = 3\).

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora will read:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.
- Total books Pandora reads: \(1 + 2 = 3\).

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:
- Total books read by Dolly: 3
- Total books read by Pandora: 3
- Combined total: \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of people Mike is still penpals with. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is still penpals with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ people} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 30 pages, so he writes 30 pages per week. He can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his monthly plan limit.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for calls to his boss. Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes used for calls to his boss is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people, which is 300 minutes. So, the total number of minutes used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes he has left is:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gave Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\), we get:
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[
32 - 4 = 28
\]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[
28 = 2 \times (2f)
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
28 = 4f

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie.

She requires makeup done 4 times a week and each session takes 6 hours. The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 4 sessions/week * 6 hours/session * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount.

Cost per hour = $250
Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

Now, we apply the 10% discount.

Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we calculate the total cost after the discount.

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000.

\[
\boxed{27000}

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue's sister ate on each day.

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day based on the information given.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, Sue consumed \(\boxed{5600}\) more calories than her sister."
"First, let's determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys} \]
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ girls} \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since the total number of students in the third class is 20, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of wolves and cougars killed last night:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

2. **Determine the number of wolves and cougars killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - Then the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - According to the problem, today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.
   - Therefore, \( c = 12 \).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed:**
   - Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.
   - Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.
   - Total animals killed: 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals.

"First, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. We know that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of 30:
\[ 30\% \times 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30 times minus 9 times:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying the new cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he has now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes: \( 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \) dollars.

4. **Dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills: \( 40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the values of all the coins and bills:
\[ 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Brady has \(\boxed{45.00}\) dollars in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight per section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books. Therefore, the total cost for the books is:

\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has 52 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

First, we can express the number of apples Andrea has in terms of Jamal's apples:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
Given that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
Substituting \( J_a = 44 \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits. We already know:
- Andrea has 52 apples.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

First, calculate the total number of fruits Jamal has:
\[ \text{Total fruits Jamal has} = J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Next, calculate the total number of fruits Andrea has:
\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 52 \]

Finally, add the total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 92 = 144 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cookies Carla is making today and tomorrow combined.
   - Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow.
   - Total cookies = 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies.
   - Two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies.
   - First, find out how many dozens of cookies 66 cookies represent.
     \[
     \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - Since 5.5 dozens of cookies require 5.5 times the amount of flour needed for one dozen.
     \[
     \text{Cups of flour needed} = 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to determine how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Next, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{62}

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees:

\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. We already know Ferdinand has 3 trees, so we calculate twice that number and then add 5:

\[
\text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]
\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[
\text{Difference in the number of trees} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125
   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of money all three girls have combined. We do this by adding the amounts of money each girl has:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175
\]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[
100 + 125 = 225
\]
\[
225 + 175 = 400
\]

Thus, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[
\boxed{400}

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

2. **Transfer Fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

3. **Total Price Including Fees:**
   Add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

4. **Comparison with Budget:**
   Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
   \]

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9500}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the transfer fees, which are 3% of the selling price of the house.

\[
\text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
\]

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of the house.

\[
\text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
\]

Now, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[
\text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
\]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 to settle the remaining loan amount. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price of the house.

\[
\text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
\]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

\[
\boxed{118000}

"First, we need to determine the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. We know that it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 350 degrees (since 400 degrees is 50 degrees above 350 degrees, and the heating rate is consistent).

The time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the time to heat from 300 degrees to 350 degrees. Therefore, we calculate the additional time as follows:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
So, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

After heating the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is:
\[ 48 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time from starting to heat the oil to having cooked the chicken is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time:
\[ 48 \text{ minutes} + 43 \text{ minutes} = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:

\[
\text{Cost per newspaper ad} = \$5
\]
\[
\text{Number of newspaper ads} = 50

\[
\text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = 5 \times 50 = \$250
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:

\[
\text{Cost per television ad} = \$75
\]
\[
\text{Number of television ads} = 15
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for television ads} = 75 \times 15 = \$1125
\]

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads to find the overall total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for newspaper ads} + \text{Total cost for television ads}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = \$1375
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of:

Next, we need to find out how many of these golf balls are blue. We know that half of the golf balls are blue, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

Thus, the number of blue golf balls is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. Therefore, the number of M&Ms in the second bag is:
   \[
   300 + 12 = 312
   \]
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had. Therefore, the number of M&Ms in the third bag is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150

   Each bedroom has 2 windows.

2. **Calculate the number of bedrooms in one house:**
   Each house has 3 bedrooms.

3. **Calculate the total number of windows in one house from the bedrooms:**
   \[
   \text{Windows from bedrooms} = \text{Number of bedrooms} \times \text{Windows per bedroom} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Add the additional windows in one house:**
   Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.

5. **Calculate the total number of windows in one house:**
   \[
   \text{Total windows in one house} = \text{Windows from bedrooms} + \text{Additional windows} = 6 + 4 = 10
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of windows in two houses:**
   \[

   \]

Thus, the total number of windows in both houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Now, let's add these amounts together:

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.95

The mother pays $20. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost from $20:

Change = $20 - $14.95

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Change = $20 - $14.95 = $5.05

So, the final numerical answer is $5.05."
"First, let's determine the number of stitches for each part of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body. Therefore, the number of stitches for the collar is:
   \[
   \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Therefore, the number of stitches for the rosette is:
   \[
   2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, the collar, and the rosette:
\[
900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
\]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:
\[
1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
\]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[
\frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}
\]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds. Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. Therefore, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
     \[

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to determine how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time to dig the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute 20 for \( M + R \) in the expression:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be written as:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

To verify, we calculate Ruby's current age using \( R = 6S \):
\[ R = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Check if Ruby is 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]

This is true, confirming our solution is correct.

"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each:

\[
20 \text{ popsicles} \times \$0.25 \text{ per popsicle} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each:

\[
4 \text{ ice cream bars} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ice cream bar} = 4 \times 0.50 = \$2.00
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[
\$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of spots for a mamba. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:

\[
\frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[
40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. Since there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots, the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[
60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots}
\]

Next, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[
2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots}
\]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[
\frac{4900}{2} = 2450
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}

"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be attending the soccer game. 

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people per pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final amount Maddy will spend is:
\[
\boxed{195}

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in one necklace.
2. Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine the number of sterling silver beads used based on the length of each bead.

First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:

2. Sum the stories written in the first week.
3. Sum the stories written in the second week.
4. Add the totals from the first and second weeks to get the overall total.

First, let's find out how many stories each child wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we sum the stories written in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.
So, the total number of stories written in the first week is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\).

Now, we sum the stories written in the second week:
- Alani wrote 40 stories.
- Braylen wrote 80 stories.
- Margot wrote 120 stories.
So, the total number of stories written in the second week is \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\).

Finally, we add the totals from the first and second weeks to get the overall total:
\[120 + 240 = 360\]

Thus, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
\]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[
\text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21
\]

Thus, Ann's brother will be \(\boxed{21}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents. We subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ stars/row} = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ stars/row} = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

3. Add the stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars to find the total number of stars in these rows:
   \[
   24 \text{ stars} + 12 \text{ stars} = 36 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. Subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:
   \[
   76 \text{ stars} - 36 \text{ stars} = 40 \text{ stars}
   \]

5. Determine the number of rows of 5 stars by dividing the number of stars in these rows by 5:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ stars}}{5 \text{ stars/row}} = 8 \text{ rows}
   \]

Thus, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds of flagstones, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[
\text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the distance and the speed of the slow lane car:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   \[
   \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   \[
   \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39
   \]

3. **Relate the total number of medals to the total number given out:**
   According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have.
   \[
   \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390
   \]

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[
\boxed{390}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets of chocolate bars and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there is a half-hour break, we need to subtract this break from the total working time.

Total working time = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Next, we need to convert the working time into minutes because Susan's earnings are given in terms of minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"To determine the total points of Mike, Jim, and Tony after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the extra point: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the extra point: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points of all three players.**

The total points are \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. Therefore, the youngest son is:

\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges. The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is:

\[
8 + 4 = 12
\]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After the sons washed 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[
15 - 12 = 3
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine the total count of activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each type of exercise he did on both days and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we calculate the total number of each type of exercise over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
\[ 100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220 \]

**Total Squats:**
\[ 50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90 \]

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
\[ 20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \]

Finally, we sum up the total number of all activities:
\[ 220 \text{ (pushups)} + 90 \text{ (squats)} + 60 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 370 \]

Thus, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of rice consumed per day by the 5 members of the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for:
\[ \boxed{3} \, \text{weeks} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- He was closed on Monday and Friday.
- He was open on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

Next, we sum the crates sold on the days he was open:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65
\]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[
120 - 65 = 55
\]

Therefore, Sam was \(\boxed{55}\) crates off from his target for the week."

   - Total distance driven in a year: \(60 \text{ miles/round trip} \times 50 \text{ round trips/year} = 3000 \text{ miles/year}\)

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: \(3000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 6000 \text{ dollars}\)

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months per year: 12 months
   - Total bonus per year: \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars}\)

4. **Calculate the total cost for the year:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $6000
   - Total bonus per year: $1800
   - Total cost for the year: \(6000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 7800 \text{ dollars}\)

Thus, the total amount John pays a year for driving is \(\boxed{7800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to find out how much time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

According to the problem, Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and how the pages are printed.

1. **Folding the Paper:**
   - A piece of paper is folded vertically.
   - This results in two layers of paper, each containing 16 pages.

2. **Printing the Pages:**
   - Page 1 is printed on the left back of the folded paper.
   - Page 2 is printed on the left front of the folded paper.
   - Page 32 is printed on the right back of the folded paper.
   - Page 31 is printed on the right front of the folded paper.

Since the paper is folded vertically, each layer of the folded paper contains 16 pages. Therefore, we need two pieces of paper to create the two layers.

Thus, the total number of pieces of paper required is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, we determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She brought $50 and spent half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. Next, we account for the additional $10 she spent on rides. Adding this to the $25 spent on food and snacks gives:

\[
25 + 10 = 35
\]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she brought:

\[
50 - 35 = 15
\]

Thus, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has a total of 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. Therefore, the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
4. This year, she sold 45 books.
5. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year. So, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold in the first two years is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
7. The total number of books sold in the three years is 200, so the number of books sold in the third year is \(200 - 135 = 65\).

Now, we need to find out how much money Elise earned in the second year. The price per book is $20. Therefore, the money earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 900 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{900} \]"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours per day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[
\text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day}
\]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.

\[
\text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week}
\]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we add this bonus to his weekly earnings:

\[
\text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week}
\]

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[
\text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \, \text{weeks}
\]

Since Watson works for a full week each week, we consider only the full weeks in April:

\[
\text{Number of full weeks in April} = 4 \, \text{weeks}
\]

Finally, we calculate his total earnings for the 4 full weeks in April:

\[
\text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[
\boxed{3200}
\]"
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[
0.80 \times 20 = 16
\]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[
20 - 16 = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we determine the number of loaves sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so we can calculate his weekly weight loss as follows:

\[
\text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as follows:

\[
\text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, we can calculate the number of weeks required as follows:

\[
\text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream. The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13, and it is now sold at $11. The discount per tub of ice cream is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on the ice cream is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk. The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5. Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on the milk is:

\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount saved if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - We need to find out how many 3-day intervals are in 15 days.
   \[
   \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/interval}} = 5 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many 5-day intervals are in 15 days.
   \[
   \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ extra arms} + 3 \text{ extra legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
   \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow \(\boxed{8}\) new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \$600 \text{ (suits)} + \$150 \text{ (suitcases)} + \$1200 \text{ (flight ticket)} = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the expenses already calculated from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of people in the family and their daily egg consumption:
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day:
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day:
   \[
   2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

4. Find the total number of eggs consumed by the entire family in one day:
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

5. Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family in one week (7 days):
   \[
   13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is 32 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To determine the population of Chile now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Noah's age six years ago.
2. Use the information about Cera's age to find Noah's age six years ago.
3. Calculate Noah's current age.
4. Use the population information to find the current population of Chile.

First, let's find Noah's age six years ago. We know that six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah's current age is 20 + 6 = 26 years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age. So, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 * 20 = 60000. Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

Thus, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} \]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people showed up for the party:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Thus, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon added to the store from Johanna. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

Next, we calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles Solomon received from his father is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, we find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store by adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the marbles his father gave him:
\[
20 + 8 = 28
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
\[
28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet}
\]

\[
V = 6 \times 4 \times 5
\]

\[
V = 24 \times 5
\]

\[
V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[
C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot}
\]

\[
C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot}
\]

\[
C = 12 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is:
\[

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the party at the beginning. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people was:

\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, we can write the equation:

\[ 22 + W = 30 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who are left at the party is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the cost of the pen is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[ 3x = 24 \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together, we add their individual totals:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \(\boxed{9}\) boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of both the cooling and the addition of cream separately, and then combine them.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[
\frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee:
\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
\]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. Therefore, the 15 milliliters of cream do not affect the milliliters weaker measurement directly.

Combining these effects, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:
\[
60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"If each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, and 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records brought in by dividing the number of new records by the trade ratio.

So, the calculation is:

"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Number of junior programmers = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\)
- Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers = \(100 - 40 = 60\)

Next, we know the monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000. We need to find the monthly salary of a senior programmer. According to the problem, senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.

\[
\text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:
\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the total salaries of junior and senior programmers:
\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop is:
\[
(x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6
\]

We are given that there were a total of 20 people on the bus at the third stop. Thus, we can set up the following equation:
\[
x + 6 = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
x + 6 = 20
\]
\[
x = 20 - 6
\]
\[
x = 14
\]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."

2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge needed.

The phone is currently at 60% charged and needs to reach 100% charge. Therefore, the remaining percentage of charge needed is:
\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the cell phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to charge the phone by 40 percentage points, we perform the following calculation:
\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip where they spent $80. The rewards system gives $1 off for every $20 spent.

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \left\lfloor \frac{80}{20} \right\rfloor = 4 \text{ rewards}
\]

Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase. So, the customer earned 4 rewards, which means they can get $4 off their next purchase.

Next, let's calculate the rewards earned from the current shopping trip where the customer spent $43. 

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \left\lfloor \frac{43}{20} \right\rfloor = 2 \text{ rewards}
\]

The customer used these 2 rewards to get $2 off their purchase. However, the coupon applied to the rewards is twice the amount of the rewards, which means the coupon is worth $4 off the purchase.

Now, let's calculate the total discount from the rewards and the coupon:

\[
\text{Total discount} = 2 \text{ rewards} + 4 \text{ coupon} = 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtract the total discount from the original purchase amount:

\[
\text{Final price} = 43 - 6 = 37 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{37}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Annual income after state tax: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Annual income after tax: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8400}

"First, we need to find the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we calculate:

\[
0.40 \times 220 = 88
\]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. According to the problem, half of the ruined castles are unmanned:

\[
\frac{88}{2} = 44
\]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

**Furniture United's Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for the monthly installments is:
\[ 6 \times 350 = 2100 \]

Adding the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments:
\[ 1350 + 2100 = 3450 \]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is $3450.

**Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

The total cost for the monthly installments is:
\[ 9 \times 250 = 2250 \]

Adding the advance payment to the total of the monthly installments:
\[ 1100 + 2250 = 3350 \]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is $3350.

Now, we find the cost difference between the two offers:
\[ 3450 - 3350 = 100 \]

The cost difference between the two offers is \(\boxed{100}\)."

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, the total number of paintball guns is 24.

Next, we need to divide these 24 guns equally among the four people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ).

To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 8 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ ounces per batch} = 240 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.

\[
\text{Sugar for fudge} = 1 \text{ batch} \times 70 \text{ ounces per batch} = 70 \text{ ounces}
\]

Now, we sum the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge:

\[
\text{Total sugar} = \text{Sugar for suckers} + \text{Sugar for fudge} = 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces}

"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share:
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4 \]
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, we calculate the value of all shares after the first year:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3 \]
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Finally, we calculate the value of all shares after the second year:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

Thus, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate as follows:

\[
\text{Number of hot dogs Thomas ate} = 3 \times \text{Number of hot dogs Luke ate} = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of hot dogs John ate} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of hot dogs Thomas ate} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We do this by subtracting the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Number of hot dogs John ate} - \text{Number of hot dogs Luke ate} = 3 - 2 = 1
\]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group will then be \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So, the number of balls he adds over the 4 weeks is:

\[ 1 \text{ ball/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Adding these to the initial 3 balls:

\[ 3 \text{ balls} + 4 \text{ balls} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. Therefore, the number of balls he has left is:

\[ 7 \text{ balls} - 3 \text{ balls} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Two of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, and one is lost. So, the number of balls Josh can use to juggle on stage is:

\[ 4 \text{ balls} - 2 \text{ balls} = 2 \text{ balls} \]

Thus, the final number of balls Josh has to juggle on stage is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal and then find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself.

1. **Weight of the pink frog:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of pink frog} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the blue beetle:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:
   \[
   \text{Weight of blue beetle} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad:
   \[
   \text{Weight of green toad} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   \[
   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird:**
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird:
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. **Total weight of one of each animal:**

"First, let's determine how many meters Tyson runs each day after taking his coach's advice. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters than he currently runs, which means he needs to run \( 1 + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{5} \) times the current distance.

Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day. Therefore, the new distance he runs each day is:
\[
5000 \times \frac{6}{5} = 5000 \times 1.2 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. June has 30 days. So, the total distance he runs in June is:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\]

Next, we calculate the number of legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[
50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs}
\]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables to find the total number of legs:

"First, let's determine the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week. She buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies. So, the total number of cookies in a week is:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box. She puts 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box in a week is:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. So, the total number of cookies her husband eats in a week is:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the number of cookies put in her son's lunch box and the number of cookies her husband eats from the total number of cookies in a week:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 20 \text{ cookies} - 7 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors is:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors.

The increase in daily revenue is:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

The percentage increase is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Increase in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let \( T \) be the total time spent. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John also spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

   \]

2. **Arcade tokens**: She wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.
   \[
   \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

3. **Go-karts**: She wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of these activities:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$5 + \$20 = \$30
\]

Morgan's total budget for the party is $90. We subtract the total cost of the activities from her budget to find out how much money is left for her and her friends:
\[
\text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
\]

Since each friend will get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 worth of arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, we need to determine how many friends can be accommodated with the remaining $60.

Each friend's total cost is:
\[
\text{Cost per friend} = \$5 + \$5 + 2 \times \$10 = \$5 + \$5 + \$20 = \$30
\]

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend to find out how many friends can be invited:
\[
\text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$30} = 2
\]

Thus, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{2}\) friends."
"First, let's determine how much pocket money Marisa receives in 5 days. Since she gets $5 every day, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, which is equivalent to $0.25. Since she buys 4 lollipops every day, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total cost of the lollipops is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the lollipops from the total pocket money to find out how much Marisa saves in her piggy bank:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. He took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. If he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since this amount is half of his change, his total change is:

\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years.

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be expressed with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third segments. The combined distance of the second and third segments is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Thus, the train goes between services every \(\frac{1}{20}\) days, which is equivalent to 12 hours. However, the question asks for the number of days, so the final answer is:
\[\boxed{12}\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. We know that a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:
\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, the total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to his friend's house, the time taken for the detour, and the time taken to drive back home:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + 6 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{42}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of fourth-grade students at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

Next, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys are at the school. We know the number of girls, which is 43. Therefore, the number of boys can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of girls} = 96 - 43 = 53
\]

On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find out how many boys were present, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:
\[
\text{Number of boys present} = \text{Total number of boys} - \text{Number of absent boys} = 53 - 4 = 49
\]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[
\boxed{49}
\]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided:

- Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

- The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters \( y \) is:
  \[
  y = 4x - 5
  \]
  Substituting \( x = 3 \):
  \[
  y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
  \]

- The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, the number of people for physical violence \( z \) is:
  \[
  z = 3y
  \]
  Substituting \( y = 7 \):
  \[
  z = 3(7) = 21
  \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( w \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Then:
\[
x + y + z + w = 50
\]
Substituting the known values \( x = 3 \), \( y = 7 \), and \( z = 21 \):
\[
3 + 7 + 21 + w = 50
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
31 + w = 50
\]
Solving for \( w \):
\[
w = 50 - 31 = 19
\]

Thus, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

To find out how many points Sara has now, we calculate:
\[ \text{Sara's points now} = 8 \]

Since Erin now has three times more points than Sara:
\[ \text{Erin's points now} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points now} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

We know that Erin scored 14 points after this, so the points Erin had before scoring these 14 points can be calculated by subtracting the 14 points from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's points now} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is \(20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24\) dollars.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is \(44 \times 24 = 1056\) dollars.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the seniors are officers, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 44 = 11 \) seniors will receive cords.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is \(11 \times 12 = 132\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1200 \]

Thus, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is \(\boxed{1200}\)."
"To determine the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper.
2. Calculate the savings from the DIY option.
3. Subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost for Ethan.

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. First, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. Therefore, the total cost for Ethan is the original cost minus the savings:

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is:

\[
\boxed{320}

"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   On Saturday, the store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   On Sunday, the store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

4. **Total Pairs Sold Before Returns:**
   Adding the pairs sold over the three days:
   \[
   14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs}

   Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour.

2. **Thursday:**
   Hallie had dance practice for 2 hours.

3. **Saturday:**
   Hallie's dance practice on Saturdays lasted twice as long as her Tuesday practice. Since her Tuesday practice was 1 hour, her Saturday practice was:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Next, we sum the hours of practice for each day:
\[
1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, we know that 40% of the total number of pieces of equipment were faulty. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment by \( N \). The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \). Therefore, the number of functioning pieces is \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. Since the faulty pieces are returned, the company only pays for the functioning pieces. The cost of the functioning pieces is the total cost multiplied by the fraction of functioning pieces, which is \( 0.6 \).

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:
\[
0.6 \times 400000 = 240000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240000}

"First, we need to determine how many sheep provide 1 kg of milk and how many provide 2 kg of milk. Since half of the 30 sheep provide 1 kg of milk and the other half provide 2 kg of milk, we can calculate the number of sheep in each group as follows:

\[
\text{Number of sheep providing 1 kg of milk} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\text{Number of sheep providing 2 kg of milk} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of milk produced by the sheep providing 1 kg of milk per day:

\[
\text{Total milk from 15 sheep providing 1 kg each} = 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ kg}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of milk produced by the sheep providing 2 kg of milk per day:

\[
\text{Total milk from 15 sheep providing 2 kg each} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we add the two amounts of milk together to find the total amount of milk collected every day:

\[
\text{Total milk collected every day} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

\[
\boxed{45}

The final numerical answer is 48."
"First, we determine the number of pupils who like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green. We calculate the number of pupils who like green:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

The rest of the pupils like yellow. We find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

"First, we need to determine how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. We know that she sold all the apples she picked on Monday and received $56 from selling them at $4 per piece. We can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday by dividing the total amount of money received by the price per apple:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

Next, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday. According to the problem, she picked 12 apples on Tuesday. 

Then, we need to determine how many apples Lucy picked on Wednesday. The problem states that she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Now, we sum the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to first calculate the total number of socks she has washed.

1. Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks from the pairs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

2. Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks from pairs} + 15 \text{ loose socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

3. Lindsay started with 50 socks. To find out how many socks she has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since the loan period is five months, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for five months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.1667\%
   \]
   The total interest for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times \frac{4.1667}{100} = 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 150 = 3800
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months. Therefore, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760
   \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. Cho's speed was 14 kilometers per hour and he hiked for 8 hours. The distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]

For Cho:
\[ D_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. Chloe's speed was 9 kilometers per hour and she hiked for 5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ D_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = D_{\text{Cho}} - D_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost to buy the supplies is $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[
\boxed{4.50}

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \).

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} L = 12.8
\]

To find the total amount of land \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 12.8 \times 5 \):

\[
12.8 \times 5 = 64
\]

Next, divide 64 by 2:

\[
64 \div 2 = 32

"First, we determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we have:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so the number of female members is 26. However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then sum them up.

- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- The total cost is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since Ms. Thompson receives 66 messages, we calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages to Ms. Thompson and the messages to Mr. Yu:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's determine the cost for David to ride all 9 rides using the ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. Therefore, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's determine the cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides using tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is $2 \times 2 = $4. For 9 rides, the total cost is $4 \times 9 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets. David's cost is $30, and Dasha's cost is $36. The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's cost and David's cost:

\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap.

Next, we need to divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

Therefore, Monica can use \(\boxed{12}\) inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio. Let the number of popsicles Betty has be \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has be \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Thus, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will use after the 20% savings for bundling.

1. **Netflix**: 
   - Original cost: $10 per month
   - Savings: 20% of $10 = 0.20 * $10 = $2
   - New cost: $10 - $2 = $8 per month

2. **Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Original cost for each: $10 per month
   - Savings: 20% of $10 = 0.20 * $10 = $2
   - New cost for each: $10 - $2 = $8 per month
   - Combined cost for Hulu and Disney Plus: $8 + $8 = $16 per month

Next, let's calculate the total monthly cost of the streaming services:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

She spends half that much time recording it, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, let's calculate the total work time in minutes:
Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
Total work time = 450 minutes

Next, we calculate the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing:
Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100
Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage spent editing = 20%

The final numerical answer is 20%."

"First, we need to determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has. We start with the cards she made herself:

\[ 20 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we account for the cards her dad brought. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards:

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ cards} \]

Now, we add the cards she made to the cards her dad brought:

\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards} \]

Erica then passed out 24 cards to her classmates:

\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \text{ cards} \]

She also gave 5 cards to her family:

\[ 26 - 5 = 21 \text{ cards} \]

Erica received 17 cards from family and friends:

\[ 21 + 17 = 38 \text{ cards} \]

"First, we need to determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[
4 \text{ slices} + 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices}
\]

Jenny eats 2 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[
7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices}
\]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:

"To determine the difference in ages between Alice and Erica, we need to first find out how old Alice is given that Erica is 30 years old.

1. We know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica. Therefore, Beth's age can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35
   \]

2. Alice is 7 years older than Beth. Therefore, Alice's age can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42
   \]

3. Now, we need to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
   \[
   \text{Difference in ages} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- Total flour needed: 12 cups
- Number of 2-cup bags required: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- Total milk needed: 4 cups
- Number of 2-cup bottles required: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"First, let's determine the energy consumption of the air conditioner per hour and per day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, the energy consumption per hour in kilowatts is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \]

If Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the daily energy consumption in kilowatts is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7.2 \text{ kW/day} \]

If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage time is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

The new daily energy consumption in kilowatts is:
\[ 0.9 \text{ kW/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2.7 \text{ kW/day} \]

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original daily consumption and the new daily consumption:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kW/day} - 2.7 \text{ kW/day} = 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \]

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kW} \]

Thus, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis at Allan's house. Given that Allan initially has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[
\text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Initial number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[
\text{New number of cannolis} = \text{Initial number of cannolis} + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100
\]

Now, we need to find the number of corns Allan has after buying 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis now, the number of corns he has is:

\[
\text{Number of corns} = \text{New number of cannolis} - 40 = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Finally, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[
\text{Combined total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{New number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160
\]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound:
- Cost: $3

For the second pound, she gets 1/2 off:
- Cost: $3 * 1/2 = $1.50

Total cost for the taffy:
- $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells:
- Cost of seashells: $1.50

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets:
- Cost per magnet: $0.25
- Number of magnets: 4
- Total cost for magnets: $0.25 * 4 = $1.00

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. Each pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost of the fireworks. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"

   \text{Number of dangerous candles with a defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price of each blouse:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Thus, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( J_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( J_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( J_{\text{avg}} \). According to the problem, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{tall}} = 30 \). She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, so \( J_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \). Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( J_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is:
\[ J_{\text{tall}} + J_{\text{short}} + J_{\text{avg}} = 30 + 15 + J_{\text{avg}} = 45 + J_{\text{avg}} \]

The total number of apples gathered by her sister is:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can write the equation:
\[ (45 + J_{\text{avg}}) + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + J_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

Therefore, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation for the total number of heads:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation for the total number of humps:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 800 km.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches.

According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, the volume of Zack's locker is:
\[
\frac{T}{2}
\]

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8}
\]

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 8:
\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at an elevation of 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

To find Stanley's comb, Oliver must climb to an elevation of 6,000 feet.

The difference in elevation between Oliver's current position and the comb's location is 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

\[

"First, let's determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue received from both banks:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Thus, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[
\boxed{17000}

"First, we start with the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. Therefore, the total number of cats carried away is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. We need to calculate 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service for Bill, we need to break down the cost into different periods and sum them up.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months: \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months: \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Next 18 months (months 9 to 26):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 18 months: \( 18 \times 14 = 252 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
48 + 24 + 252 = 324
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{324}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:
\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \(S\). Since he saved $6 in total, we have:
\[ S = 6 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28 and the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bird feeders Lillian has. She builds 3 and buys 3 more, so she has:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ bird feeders} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of birds each type of feeder attracts. Let's denote the number of store-bought feeders as \( B \) and the number of feeders Lillian made as \( M \). Since she has 6 feeders in total, we have:

\[ B + M = 6 \]

Given that the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each and the feeders Lillian made attract 10 more birds each, we can denote the number of birds each of her feeders attracts as \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) birds. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the feeders is:

\[ B \times 20 + M \times 30 \]

Since \( B + M = 6 \), we can express \( M \) as \( 6 - B \). Substituting \( M \) in the total birds equation, we get:

\[ B \times 20 + (6 - B) \times 30 \]

Now, we simplify the expression:

\[ 20B + 180 - 30B = 180 - 10B \]

To find the total number of birds, we need to determine the value of \( B \). Since the problem does not specify the exact number of store-bought feeders, we can assume the simplest case where the number of store-bought feeders is equal to the number of feeders Lillian made, i.e., \( B = 3 \) and \( M = 3 \). This assumption is reasonable because it balances the equation and simplifies the calculation:

\[ 180 - 10 \times 3 = 180 - 30 = 150 \]

Thus, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards:**
   Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny earned from selling the cards:**
   The cost of the ticket to the amusement park is $100. Since Kenny only has $50 after spending, the amount he earned from selling the cards is:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   Kenny sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he earned by the price per card:
   \[
   \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{50 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 cards.

4. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards he started with. Therefore, the 33 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total collection. Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with. Then:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 33
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 49.5
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 49 cards.

Thus, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"First, let's determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if only the original 36 guests had attended. Since half of the guests would have eaten two hotdogs, we calculate:

\[
\frac{36}{2} = 18
\]

This means that 18 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for these 18 guests is:

\[
18 \times 2 = 36
\]

Since 40 guests actually showed up, and each of these guests wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is:

\[
40 \times 2 = 80
\]

The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests to have two each, which is 36 hotdogs. Since 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, the number of additional hotdogs needed is:

\[
80 - 36 = 44
\]

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
40 - 36 = 4
\]

Thus, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to find the total:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The pot and pans set costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00
\]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[
0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[
165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00
\]

Thus, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[
\boxed{132.00}

Next, let's determine the total amount of money Dora currently has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs to buy the items:
- Total cost of items: $19
- Total money Dora has: $18

Additional money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has = $19 - $18 = $1

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Since Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Now, we calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Thus:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we can calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[
\text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needed. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, which is:

\[
\text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ container} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
\]

Now, we need to convert the amount of gas needed from gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints as follows:

\[
\text{Gas needed in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

Thus, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money George spent:**
   George spent $5.

2. **Determine the amount of money George had left:**
   Since he had 1% of his money left, the amount of money he had left is:
   \[
   0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of money George spent on chips:**
   Since he spent $5 in total and had 5 cents left, the amount spent on chips is:
   \[
   5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} = 495 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of bags of chips George bought:**
   Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the number of bags of chips he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{495}{40} = 12.375
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole bags of chips, he bought 12 bags of chips.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the chips George bought:**
   The cost of 12 bags of chips is:
   \[
   12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Determine the amount of money George spent on candy bars:**
   The total amount spent on chips is 480 cents, so the amount spent on candy bars is:
   \[
   495 - 480 = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]

7. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{15}{75} = 0.2
   \]
   Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 0 candy bars.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory cuts into pieces. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the weight of the cake they have together is:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake:

\[

"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Antoine's soup serves 6 people, so we need to find the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:
\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:
\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to determine the width of the room first. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
\]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, we have:

\[
\text{Length} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[
360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}
\]

Solving for the width:

\[
\text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is:

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"First, let's convert all the times Jon took for each part of the triathlon into minutes:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Next, we calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
\[
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[
40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[
80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. According to the problem, Jon won the triathlon by 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

We can set up the equation for the total time James took:
\[
36 + 85 + R = 180
\]

Solving for \( R \):
\[
121 + R = 180
\]
\[
R = 180 - 121
\]
\[
R = 59 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[
\boxed{59}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times \frac{30}{60} \, \text{hours} = 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   \[
   \text{Hay per mile} = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bale}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bale/mile} = 8 \, \text{bales}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bale} = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bales} \times \$3/\text{bale} = \$24
   \]

4. **Determine the change Michael has after buying the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 = \$30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$30 - \$24 = \$6

"First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays she can put out is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

\[
\text{Joey's new score} = 214 + 26 = 240
\]

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

\[
\text{Marcy's new score} = 225 + 10 = 235
\]

Now, we need to determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score to find out by how many points Joey is now winning:

"First, let's determine the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[
\text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each on Monday:

\[
\text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining number of sneakers sold to the department store is:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The revenue from the department store is:

\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total revenue from both sales is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:

\[
\boxed{539}

6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces per packet} = 48 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[
4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces per packet} = 64 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[
48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and then buying one popcorn and one soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the individual items. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 more than the cost of buying the individual items:
\[ 21 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 17 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 17 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   \[
   \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon:**
   The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   \[
   \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
   \]
   \[
   170 \times 60 = 10200
   \]
   \[
   170 \times 5 = 850
   \]
   \[
   10200 + 850 = 11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \( 50 \, \text{mph} \).

"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires and she trades 3 of them. So, the number of sapphires she has left is:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies she has. The value of the sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

The value of the rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days:
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - In 30 days, Marin eats \( 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \).

2. Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days:
   - Nancy eats 4 apples per day.
   - In 30 days, Nancy eats \( 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \).

3. Calculate the total number of apples both Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days:
   - Total apples = Apples eaten by Marin + Apples eaten by Nancy
   - Total apples = \( 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \).

Thus, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to determine the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is calculated as follows:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[
\boxed{1920}

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"

So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there. The total number of fairies after these 25 fairies joined is:

\[
50 + 25 = 75
\]

Next, we need to account for the 30 fairies that flew away ten minutes later. The number of fairies remaining after 30 flew away is:

\[
75 - 30 = 45
\]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[

"First, we need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then extend that to four weeks.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week.

\[
\text{Weekly earnings from aluminum cans} = 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}
\]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles per week.

\[
\text{Weekly earnings from plastic bottles} = 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}
\]

Now, we add the weekly earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total weekly earnings:

\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}
\]

To find her total earnings over a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

\[
\text{Total earnings in four weeks} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}

"First, we determine the total number of pencils the class started with. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

The number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

So, the final number of pencils left is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \). We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. To verify, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the number of cookies:

\[
\frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
\]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches for consistency.

1 foot = 12 inches

The length of the shark is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches/remora} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The combined length of the remoras is 12 inches, and the shark's body length is 120 inches.

The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = \frac{1}{10} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at the grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:
\[
\frac{1}{4} x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of students at the grade level is \( 80 \).

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine how many books each of Sarah's 4 kids received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we know that Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. Therefore, the total number of books she bought is:
\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids. Sarah has 4 kids, so:
\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Thus, each child received \boxed{5} books."
"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This is given by the union of sets \( D \) and \( P \), denoted as \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in total in the class.

The number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

\[
\text{Total number of employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

\[
\text{Total number of tour guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of employees} + \text{Total number of tour guides} = 600 + 21 = 621

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since Tom and his wife are both going, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but because it is a busy weekend, the price is 20% more expensive. To find the increased price per day, we calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
So, the hotel costs $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

\text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can still add to their player. Each player can store up to 100 songs.

\[
\text{Number of songs Gabriel can still add} = 100 - 20 = 80
\]

\[
\text{Number of songs Luri can still add} = 100 - 60 = 40
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of songs each can still add.

\[

"First, let's determine the cost of one pack of razors before any discounts. Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.

Next, we need to consider the sale offer, which is ""buy one get one free."" Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she will get 2 packs for the price of 1 pack. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs under the sale is the same as the cost of 1 pack.

The cost of 2 packs under the sale is $4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to this cost. Subtracting the coupon from the sale price, we get:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \]

So, the total cost for 2 packs of razors after the discount is $2.00.

Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs will contain:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

To find the cost per individual razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
\[ \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents per razor} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid. The cheerleaders are arranged in a specific order from the bottom to the top, with the shortest cheerleader at the top.

Given:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
- 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall.
- The cheerleaders are arranged in the following order from bottom to top: 4 girls at the bottom, 3 girls on top of the 4, 2 girls on top of the 3, and the shortest girl at the top.

The heights of the cheerleaders are:
- 4 girls at 64 inches each.
- 3 girls at 64 inches each.
- 2 girls at 64 inches each.
- 1 girl at 60 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:
- The 4 girls at the bottom contribute \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.
- The 3 girls on top of the 4 contribute \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches.
- The 2 girls on top of the 3 contribute \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches.
- The shortest girl at the top contributes \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of the pyramid in inches:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches.

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet.

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is \(\boxed{53}\) feet."
"Charisma works for 8 hours every day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes each day.

She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. Since she works for 480 minutes each day, the number of times she walks is \(480 \div 60 = 8\) times a day (once every hour).

Each time she walks, she walks for 5 minutes. Therefore, the total number of minutes she walks in a day is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes.

Over 5 days, the total number of minutes she walks is \(40 \times 5 = 200\) minutes.

So, the final answer is 200 minutes."
"To determine Angela's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Brett's age in four years.

- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{224}

"Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost \( C_1 \) is given by:
\[ C_1 = 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost \( C_2 \) is given by:
\[ C_2 = 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set \( C_1 \) equal to \( C_2 \):
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]
\[ 200 = 30n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 25n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} \]
\[ n = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we solve for \( D \) by isolating the variable. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

First, let's determine how much yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[
\text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's determine how much yarn her grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Similarly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Yarn used by her grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:
\[
\text{Total yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. 

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: 
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ gifts}
  \]

- 3 friends want 2 gifts each:
  \[
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts}
  \]

Next, we add the gifts for her 5 friends:
\[
10 + 6 = 16 \text{ gifts}
\]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. 

Adding these to the previous total:
\[
16 + 10 = 26 \text{ gifts}
\]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet. Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). According to the problem, Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from these 2 x 4 pieces. Each 2 x 4 piece yields 200 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200
\]

Now, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from these 2 x 8 pieces. Each 2 x 8 piece yields 400 sticks.

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600
\]

Comparing the total number of sticks from both types of wood, we see that Frederick can get 1600 sticks from the 2 x 8 pieces.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:

\[
\boxed{1600}

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the sled dogs.
2. Determine how many pairs of snowshoes are needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

First, we know that each sled dog has 4 legs and there are 6 sled dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20. Thus, the total cost for her bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times 2.20 \text{ dollars/trip} = 22 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of buying a weekly bus pass, which is $20.

The savings by buying the weekly bus pass instead of paying for each trip individually is:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars/week} - 20 \text{ dollars/week} = 2 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \text{ dollars/week} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cows on the farm and the zoo:**

1. Calculate the total number of pounds Andy needs to lose.
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.

2. Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose these pounds.
   Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of days Andy has until his birthday.
   Andy's birthday is July 19th, and today is December 31st. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th can be calculated as follows:
   - December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
   - January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
   - February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
   - March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
   - April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
   - May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
   - June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
   - July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.
   Adding these up, the total number of days is:
   \[
   19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 152 \text{ days}

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot \( L \) is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house \( H \):

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \( 90,000 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} \times \$4/\text{pack} = 8 \times 5 \times 4 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs \(\times\) 5 bags/pack) for $8 each.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 40 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 320 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{160}

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the work rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) house in 5 days.
   - The work rate of one person is \(\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10}\) house per day.

2. **Determine the work rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) house per day, then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) house per day.

3. **Determine the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) house per day, they can paint 1 whole house in \(2\) days.

4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people \(\boxed{48}\) hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \). Solving for \( C_O \), we find \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has \( S_O + C_O = 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has \( S_J + C_J = 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 42 + 130 = 172 \).

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is \(\boxed{172}\)."

   \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of CDs Tom could buy with the money spent on the headphone set:**
   Each CD costs $4. Therefore, the number of CDs Tom could buy with $44 is:
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]

3. **Determine how many more CDs Tom could buy without the headphone set:**
   If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have $48 to spend on CDs. The number of CDs he could buy with $48 is:
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference in the number of CDs:**
   The difference in the number of CDs Tom could buy is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 12 - 11 = 1
   \]

Thus, Tom would have been able to buy \(\boxed{1}\) more CD if he had decided not to buy the headphone set."
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the different amounts of time he spent each week.

1. Identify the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours each week. Since he worked out 5 hours for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours for one week, and we know he worked out 4 hours for the remaining weeks, we can calculate the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours each week as follows:
   - Total weeks = 8
   - Weeks with 5 hours = 2
   - Weeks with 6 hours = 1
   - Weeks with 4 hours = 8 - 2 - 1 = 5

2. Calculate the total hours for each group of weeks:
   - Hours from weeks with 4 hours each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)
   - Hours from weeks with 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Hours from weeks with 6 hours each: \(1 \times 6 = 6\)

3. Sum the hours from all the weeks:
   \[
   20 + 10 + 6 = 36
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, we start by finding Jame's current age. We know that in 5 years, Jame will be 27 years old. Therefore, we can calculate his current age as follows:

\[ \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. First, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years:

\[ 2 \times (27 + 8) = 2 \times 35 = 70 \]

Since Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than this age in 8 years, we have:

\[ \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 70 - 5 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find Jame's cousin's current age. Since Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years, we can determine his current age as follows:

\[ \text{Cousin's current age} = 65 - 8 = 57 \]

Finally, we need to find the difference in their current ages:

\[ \text{Age difference} = 57 - 22 = 35 \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of Jame and his cousin now is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so \( P = C - 400 \).
3. The cost of the computer is $1,100, so \( C = 1100 \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls.
2. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys.
3. Use the information about the seashells brought by the girls to find the number of seashells each girl brought.

First, we know that there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Each boy brought 60 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"If George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, Nick had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[
\text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6
\]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[
\text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
\]

Thus, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm}
\]

Adding these together step by step:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is:
\[
\boxed{188}

"To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

1. Vlogs made in the first week: 18
2. Vlogs made in the second week: 21
3. Vlogs made in the third week: 15

Next, we sum these values:
\[
18 + 21 + 15
\]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
\[
18 + 21 = 39
\]
\[
39 + 15 = 54
\]

So, Emma has made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks.

Now, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month:
\[
72 - 54 = 18
\]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) more vlogs to complete her monthly goal."
"First, we need to calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. The dinner bill is $50.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of money is $18.
   - This amount is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The next day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending $8:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - After spending $8, he has $13.
   - He triples this amount:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in April.
2. Determine the number of days in the second half of April.
3. Set up an equation to find the daily savings in the second half of April.

First, we know that April has 30 days. The second half of April consists of 15 days (15th to 30th).

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = \( 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \) dollars.

Verna gave $20 to the cashier. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost
- Change = \( 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.00}

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Distance for one round trip:**
   - Jeff walks to his work and back home each day.
   - The distance to his work is 3 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance is:
     \[
     3 \text{ miles (to work)} + 3 \text{ miles (back home)} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Distance for one work week:**
   - Jeff works 5 days a week.
   - Each day he walks 6 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance for one work week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week}

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water.

1. **Cold Water:**
   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Warm Water:**
   - It is stated that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.
   - Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this, the time in warm water is \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

3. **Cold Water for 3 Miles:**
   - Time for 1 mile = 16 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Warm Water for 3 Miles:**
   - Time for 1 mile = 34 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles = \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm water and cold water.

5. **Difference in Time:**
   - Time for 3 miles in warm water = 102 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles in cold water = 48 minutes.
   - Difference = \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker, we calculate:

\[
\text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Thus, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5R - 4} \]"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- The total number of rodents is \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark's weight = 150 pounds

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight = 2 * 130 pounds = 260 pounds

Now, we calculate the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

The final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"To determine how many degrees from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the angle the sun makes with the ground at that time.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun Relative to the Ground:**
   The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Sun's Movement Relative to the Pyramid:**
   The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house every hour.

3. **Total Movement of the Sun Over 10 Hours:**
   Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **New Angle of the Sun Relative to the Ground:**
   Since the sun moves 50 degrees upward from the pyramid, the new angle from the ground to the sun is:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. We know that one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

So, the ages of the sons are 12 and 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the total number of candles required. Since James buys one candle for each son, the total number of candles is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Since James needs to buy 4 packs of candles, the total cost is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, we have:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the second week. We know that she read a total of 100 pages in the second week. So, the number of pages read in the second week is:
\[ 100 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we need to determine how many pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 105 minutes in the first week and that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 1.5 minutes, we use the ratio:
\[ \text{Pages per minute} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Therefore, the number of pages she read in 105 minutes is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we can find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks by adding the pages read in the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let \( x \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.
2. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
3. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.
4. In 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
51 = 3(x + 7)
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Distribute the 3 on the right-hand side:
\[
51 = 3x + 21
\]

2. Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
51 - 21 = 3x
\]
\[
30 = 3x
\]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{30}{3}
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Thus, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next three teeth:**
   The tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each of these teeth.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last two teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as received for each of the previous three teeth.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \$1.00 = \$0.50 \text{ per tooth}
   \]
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to find out how many goals Mark and Anna scored individually, and then sum the goals scored by each teenager.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[
\boxed{175}

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, the total amount Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that Liam made $63 that weekend. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made \(\boxed{21}\) more dollars than Liam."
"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and he wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) during which he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for wooden action figures is:

\[
4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining amount of money Peter has is:

\[
70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter buys plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ action figures}
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. He bought 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures, so the total number of action figures is:

"First, let's determine the cost of ingredients for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost of ingredients for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ 3.00 + 30.00 = 33.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches. Each sandwich is sold for $7.00, so the revenue from 10 sandwiches is:
\[ 10 \times 7.00 = 70.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost of ingredients from the total revenue:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to achieve 520 degrees, we first need to find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees is 468 degrees. The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:
\[ \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is always off by 4% of the set temperature. To find the set temperature that will give an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature \( T \) will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees when the oven is off by 4%.

If the oven is off by 4%, then the actual temperature is 96% of the set temperature. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.96T = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{0.96} = 541.67 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the temperature Maggie should set her oven to is:
\[ 542 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{542} \]"
"First, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we can calculate the total minutes for the first movie as follows:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 1 \text{ hour and 30 minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. We convert this into minutes similarly:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 2 \text{ hours and 5 minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the durations of both movies to find the total time Max will spend watching them:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To determine the value of Juan's house and the combined value of both houses, we start by calculating the price of Juan's house. We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, which costs $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[
0.30 \times 76000 = 22800
\]
This means Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. Therefore, the price of Juan's house is:
\[
76000 - 22800 = 53200
\]

Next, we find the combined value of both houses by adding the prices of Juan's and Herb's houses:
\[
76000 + 53200 = 129200
\]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} \]

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so the number of dishes she bought is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

At the event, her friend brought:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} \]
\[ 20 \text{ more dishes than Judy's friend brought} = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes brought:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 60 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 84 \text{ dishes} \]

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by the two is:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 84 \text{ dishes} = 136 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{136} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount.

The original price of one box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 2 boxes at the discounted price:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts and there are 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the number of pairs of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \]

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. Therefore, the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

On Saturday, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

On Sunday, John worked:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's total earnings:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's total earnings:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- We set up the ratio: 100 ml / 200 calories.
- We need to find out how many ml of water are needed for 1600 calories.

Using the ratio:
\[ \text{Water needed} = \left( \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} \right) \times 1600 \text{ calories} \]

Simplify the ratio:
\[ \frac{100}{200} = \frac{1}{2} \]

So:
\[ \text{Water needed} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 1600 = 800 \text{ ml} \]

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500. \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500. \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500. \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485. \]

The number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515. \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30. \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans is 30 more than the number of red jelly beans. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine the three typing speed measurements:

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after lessons: 52 WPM
3. Speed after further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we need to find the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average of three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{a + b + c}{3}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the three measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Thus, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - The protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms is:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

First, we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Thus, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."

"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

"First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the amount Marissa makes in one hour as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

"First, we need to determine the total number of tire rotations Jeremy's car undergoes in a month. We know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
\]

\[
\text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per month:

\[
\text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months}
\]

Now, we need to convert the number of months into years. Since there are 12 months in a year:

"To determine the cost of each pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washes that can be achieved with one bottle of shampoo.
2. Determine the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash from dollars to cents.

First, we know that the bottle of shampoo gives 120 washes with 2 pumps. Therefore, with 1 pump, the number of washes is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is also a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Next, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Thus, the final amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:

   \]

2. **Determine the amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants:**
   - We know that 1 dozen croissants require \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter.
   - Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter required is:
   \[
   28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"First, we need to calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Given that it costs $194 per meter and Monica's street is 150 meters long, the cost for Monica's street is:

"First, we determine the total duration of John's research. The initial research took 5 months, and it ended up taking 10 times that long. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:

\[ 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the funding for the first 5 months. The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month increased by 50%. This means each month after the first 5 months received $100,000 \times 1.5 = $150,000.

The total funding for the remaining 45 months is:

\[ 45 \text{ months} \times 150,000 \text{ dollars/month} = 6,750,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the initial funding to the funding for the remaining months, we get the total cost of the research:

\[ 100,000 \text{ dollars} + 6,750,000 \text{ dollars} = 6,850,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:

Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
\[
\text{Total loads per year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of water used in a year.**

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
\[
\text{Total gallons of water used per year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.**

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

Thus, the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is \(\boxed{312}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Scarlett bought:

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. The cost of 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5.00\).
3. The cost of 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each is \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\).
4. The cost of 20 fish at $0.50 each is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10.00\).
5. The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, we sum up all these costs to find the total amount spent:

\[
10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00
\]

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is \(\boxed{33.00}\)."

3. **Third Week:** It grew another 4 inches. So, \( 6 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches} \).

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was \(\boxed{10}\) inches tall."
"First, we need to determine how much meat Prince sells in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the entire 750 kg of meat from the bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat sold per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is given by the number of rows multiplied by the number of seats per row:
   \[
   4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have been seated is:
   \[
   72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have been seated:
   \[
   54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of street lights at all intersections. Each intersection has 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. Therefore, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:

\[ 4 \text{ intersections} \times 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. Therefore, the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is:

\[
\boxed{76}
\]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play counts for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times. It can be played a total of 1000 times before breaking. Therefore, the remaining play count for the first DVD is:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644
   \]

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times. It can be played a total of 1000 times before breaking. Therefore, the remaining play count for the second DVD is:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865
   \]

3. To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \(\boxed{1509}\)."
"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Determine the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of therapy sessions.**

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time.

\[
\text{Number of sessions per week} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ sessions}
\]

\[
\text{Total number of sessions} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ sessions/week} = 24 \text{ sessions}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hours John spent in therapy.**

Each session is 2 hours long.

\[
\text{Total hours} = 24 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.**

The cost per hour is $125.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 48 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 6000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of John's physical therapy is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"First, let's determine how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, he chews:

\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces of gum during the school day.}
\]

Additionally, he chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:

\[
1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces of gum outside of school.}
\]

Adding these together, the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews during the day is:

\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces of gum.}
\]

Since Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum, the number of pieces of gum he has left after chewing 6 pieces is:

\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces of gum.}
\]

Next, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister right before bed. Therefore, he gives:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces of gum to his sister.}
\]

The number of pieces of gum Jim has left after giving half to his sister is:

\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces of gum.}
\]

Thus, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we start by noting that she will be 16 years old in 12 years. This means her current age is:

\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old she will be 4 years from now. If she is currently 4 years old, then in 4 years she will be:

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:

\[
9 \text{ baseballs} \times \$3 \text{ per baseball} = 9 \times 3 = \$27
\]

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:

\[
8 \text{ basketballs} \times \$14 \text{ per basketball} = 8 \times 14 = \$112
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach. We subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[
\$112 - \$27 = \$85
\]

Thus, the basketball coach spent \(\boxed{85}\) dollars more than the baseball coach."
"To determine how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed based on the given fraction.

First, we calculate the total number of flowers in the garden. There are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row:
\[
10 \times 20 = 200
\]
So, there are 200 flowers in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160
\]
Thus, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet connection speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the number of kilobytes by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can receive in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

To find the internet speed in Mb per hour, we multiply the speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. According to the problem, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day on these remaining days compared to the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate his current height in feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more height Adam needs to reach the 4 feet required to ride the roller coaster. This can be calculated by subtracting his current height from the required height:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow an additional \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the 10 cars James sold. Each car costs $25,000, so the total cost is:
\[ 10 \times 25000 = 250000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these 10 cars. The company paid 30% of the total cost:
\[ 0.30 \times 250000 = 75000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made by subtracting the amount the company paid from the total cost:
\[ 250000 - 75000 = 175000 \]

James receives a 10% commission on the profits. Therefore, we calculate the commission:
\[ 0.10 \times 175000 = 17500 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"To determine how many men can stay upright on the wave, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives:**
   - Given that only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
   - Total number of riders = 100.
   - Number of riders who can stay upright = \( 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \).

2. **Determine the number of these riders who are women:**
   - Given that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women.
   - Number of women who can stay upright = \( 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \).

3. **Calculate the number of men who can stay upright:**
   - Total number of riders who can stay upright = 25.
   - Number of women who can stay upright = 15.
   - Number of men who can stay upright = Total number of riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright.
   - Number of men who can stay upright = \( 25 - 15 = 10 \).

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."

   \[
   \text{Price of a diamond jewel} = \$2000
   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

Next, we need to find out how many rose stamps Max bought. The problem states that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Since Max bought 19 truck stamps, the number of rose stamps is:

\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \]

Now, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:

\[ 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close the gap, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many fish Darren caught. According to the problem, Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Since Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[
\text{Number of fish Darren caught} = 17 - 6 = 11
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. The problem states that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[
\text{Number of fish Tommy caught} = 11 + 3 = 14

Thus, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). The total cost for 10 classes is given by:
\[ 10x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses any classes, the cost per class will increase. We need to find out how many classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Let's assume Manny misses \( m \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - m \) classes. The total cost remains $60, but it is now spread over \( 10 - m \) classes. The cost per class in this case is:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - m} \]

We need this cost per class to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - m} \leq 10 \]

Solving this inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - m) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10m \]
\[ 10m \leq 40 \]
\[ m \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to first find out how many customers each of them processes in a day and then calculate their weekly totals.

1. **Determine the number of customers Jewel processes in a day:**
   \[
   \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 50
   \]

2. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes in a day:**
   Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, she processes:
   \[
   \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by Jewel in a week:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by Julie in a week:**
   Similarly, there are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Jewel's weekly customers} + \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 350 + 700 = 1050
   \]

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

To find the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

Cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet}
\]

\[
V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required is:

\[
T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot}
\]

\[
T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot}

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants. The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.

\[
\text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150
\]

James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.

\[
\text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.

\[
\text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Each dress shirt costs $60.

\[
\text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
\]

Finally, we sum up the costs of all the items:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800
\]

Thus, the total cost is:

\[
\boxed{10800}
\]"
"To determine the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the number of articles published by the news website in February. The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the number of articles published by the sister company in February. The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the number of articles published by both websites to find the total number of articles published in February:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

Thus, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of Steve's family members.

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, so her age is:
   \[
   60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Steve's son is half as old as his mom, so his age is:
   \[
   \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
   \]
4. Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is:
   \[
   32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Steve's son's wife is \(\boxed{29}\) years old."
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply the amount of flour in one bag by three to find the total amount of flour in three bags.

First, we know that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. Therefore, the amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. We do this by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by 3:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the distance each person biked.

For Alisa:
- Speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time: 4.5 hours

The distance Alisa biked can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

For Stanley:
- Speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time: 2.5 hours

Similarly, the distance Stanley biked is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Bill can dig through each type of material.

- Bill can dig 4 feet of soil per hour.
- Bill can dig half that speed through clay, which means he can dig \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet of clay per hour.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately.

- Time to dig through 24 feet of soil:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
  \]

- Time to dig through 8 feet of clay:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

Finally, we add the time taken to dig through both the soil and the clay to find the total time required to dig the well:
\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

- His teacher
- 25 classmates

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 \]

Next, we need to determine how many cupcakes each person will get. According to the problem, each person will get 2 cupcakes.

To find the total number of cupcakes needed, we multiply the total number of people by the number of cupcakes each person will get:
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the number of likes Fishio received after three weeks. We know that after one week, she received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.

The initial number of likes after one week is 2000. Therefore, the number of likes after three weeks is:
\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many likes she received recently. According to the problem, she received 20000 more new likes recently. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140000 likes she had after three weeks:
\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Thus, the total number of Instagram likes Fishio has now is:
\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 voucher, so the total cost after the voucher is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final cost after the discount is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

Thus, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half of the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

To find \( G \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800. The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the total sales in the second month are:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   James gets 1 hour of free carriage time. Therefore, he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each paid hour:**
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.

4. **Calculate the cost for the second paid hour:**
   The second paid hour costs \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the cost for the third paid hour:**
   The third paid hour costs \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

6. **Sum the costs of the paid hours:**
   - First paid hour: $15
   - Second paid hour: $30
   - Third paid hour: $60

   Total cost = \(15 + 30 + 60 = 105\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{105}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Determine how much money was withheld from her wage.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. If she earned $220 this week, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected weekly wage and the amount she actually earned. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori will need for her 16 guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we calculate:

\[
16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. We know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. Therefore, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
\]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel:

- Monthly cost for renting the hanger: $5000
- Monthly cost for fuel: $5000 * 2 = $10000

Total monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months) for renting the hanger and fuel:
\[ 15000 \times 12 = 180000 \]

Now, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual cost of renting and fueling:
\[ 150000 + 180000 = 330000 \]

Therefore, the total cost for getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is:
\[ \boxed{330000} \]"
"First, let's determine the cooking times for each item:

1. **Rice**: It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.
2. **Pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Beans**: The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is half of this combined time:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cooking times for all the items:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is:

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs \(\boxed{3}\) dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

First, let's express the total number of heads:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Next, let's express the total number of legs. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

To eliminate \( g \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he needs coffee for 7 days, the total cost of the coffee is:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 7 \text{ pounds} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:

\[ 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\[4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:

\[20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\]

Therefore, the apple pie cost \(\boxed{7.00}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.
The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198.
The number of newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

Let's calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B:

\[
\text{Newspapers to District B} = \text{Total newspapers} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C})
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209)
\]

First, add the newspapers delivered to District A and District C:

\[
198 + 209 = 407
\]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers:

\[
600 - 407 = 193

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
150 - 90 = 60
\]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps per day:

\[
60 \times 6 = 360
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\boxed{360}

"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150
\]

Now, we can find the total amount of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:

\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360
\]

If they decide to add together their money and share it equally among the three of them, each person will get:

"To determine the total number of tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of each type of dry ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

1. **Flour:**
   - Each muffin requires 5 tablespoons of flour.
   - For 16 muffins: \( 5 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 80 \text{ tablespoons} \).

2. **Sugar:**
   - Each muffin requires 3 tablespoons of sugar.
   - For 16 muffins: \( 3 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 48 \text{ tablespoons} \).

3. **Salt:**
   - Each muffin requires 0.25 tablespoons of salt.
   - For 16 muffins: \( 0.25 \text{ tablespoons/muffin} \times 16 \text{ muffins} = 4 \text{ tablespoons} \).

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height difference between the current height and the target height. The target height is 600 inches, and the current height is 240 inches. Therefore, the height difference is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, we divide the height difference by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Thus, the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs. With 8 more dogs, he needs 8 more toys. So, the total number of toys needed initially is:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

After buying the toys, James went back to see that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 4 dogs, and he added 8 more, so there were 12 dogs in total. Now, there are twice as many more dogs than 12, which means there are:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dogs} \]

So, James needs toys for 24 dogs. Since he already has 12 toys, he needs:

\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \text{ more toys} \]

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Therefore, the number of toys he needs is now:

\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

So, the total number of toys James needs is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To determine how much Skyler's investment was, we need to follow the sequence of investments step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invests \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invests \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. **Skyler's Investment:**
   Skyler's investment accounts for the rest of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

Thus, Skyler's investment was \(\boxed{240}\)."

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we start by finding out how many hash browns are made from one potato. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. Therefore, the number of hash browns per potato is:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes. Since each potato makes 6 hash browns, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:

\[
96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
576
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we add Jack's weight to this total. Jack's weight is 80 kg. Thus, the combined weight of Jack and the 8 adults is:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed this maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

First, let's express the number of cookies Max has in terms of \( C \):
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = C + 12 \]

Next, let's express the number of cookies Katarina has in terms of Max's cookies:
\[ \text{Katarina's cookies} = (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \]

We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies:
\[ C + 7 = 68 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 68 - 7 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Now, we can find the number of cookies Max has:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \]

Next, we find the number of cookies Summer has:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of cookies:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 96 + 61 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 96 = 237 \]
\[ 237 + 61 = 298 \]

Thus, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can set up the following equation to represent the final length of the dress:
\[
x + 0.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
1.5x + 20 = 140
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
1.5x = 120
\]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80
\]

Thus, the original length of the dress was \(\boxed{80}\) cm."
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's establish the time it takes for Chris to mow the lawn in each mode:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 1 hour (which is 60 minutes).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes.

Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode. Therefore, the time taken for each half is:
- Time for the first half in ""turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- Time for the second half in ""rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

To find the total time, we add the time for the first half and the time for the second half:
\[
60 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn is:
\[
\boxed{100}

- Time to get to the fire station from the corner: 13 minutes

Total time to the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know they have a total of 30 minutes to get to school.

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time it takes them to get to the fire station from the total time they have:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = \( 1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4 \).

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = \( 2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4 \).

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = \( 2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6 \).

Next, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total amount Catherine pays:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of bananas} + \text{Cost of oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$4 + \$4 + \$6 = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60
\]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[
\text{Total cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90
\]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract these from the total number of cookies:

\[
\text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80
\]

Thus, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's denote the ages of the twins and triplets as follows:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one twin.
- Let \( Tr \) be the age of one triplet.

Given that there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, and one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We are also given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 2Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2(T + Tr) = 44 \]
\[ T + Tr = 22 \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( T = Tr + 7 \)
2. \( T + Tr = 22 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (Tr + 7) + Tr = 22 \]
\[ 2Tr + 7 = 22 \]
\[ 2Tr = 15 \]
\[ Tr = \frac{15}{2} \]
\[ Tr = 7.5 \]

Now, substitute \( Tr = 7.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( T \):
\[ T = 7.5 + 7 \]
\[ T = 14.5 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{14.5} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total time John spends on his homework. The time spent on each subject is as follows:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time John has before he has to eat dinner. The problem states that John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 3 hours into minutes:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time John spends on his homework from the total time he has before dinner to find out how many minutes he has left for a nap:
\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes John has to nap is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one lollipop and one candy.

Given:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

Let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Next, we know the total cost of the lollipops and candies is $3.20. Therefore, the total cost of the four candies is:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Now, let's find the cost of one candy:
\[ 4 \text{ candies} \times \$1.20 \text{ for four candies} = \$1.20 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{\$1.20}{4} = \$0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, the number of coins Neil saves per month is:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years (120 months), Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over the ten years:

\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and John needs 2 vaccines:

\[
2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let \( T \) represent the total bill. Therefore, the heartworm check costs:

\[
0.60T
\]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[
T = 40 + 0.60T
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[
T - 0.60T = 40
\]

\[
0.40T = 40
\]

\[
T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100
\]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[
125 - 100 = 25
\]

Thus, the final amount John leaves with is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[
\text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana:
\[
\text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in a crate:
\[
\text{Total cost for bananas} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in a crate:
\[
\text{Total cost for apples} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in a crate:
\[
\text{Total cost for oranges} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
\text{Total price of the crate} = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of each colored square on Brittany's quilted comforter.

1. **Red squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White squares:**
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of squares:
\[
\text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter in square feet is equal to the total number of squares:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are currently available. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available is:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs are needed. The number of additional chairs required is the total number of people minus the number of chairs currently available:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

"First, let's determine the number of points collected by each student.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty collected, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Betty} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points, so:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Tom} = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Marta} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

Now, we sum up the points collected by Adam, Betty, and Marta:
\[
\text{Total points collected by Adam, Betty, and Marta} = 50 + 65 + 90 = 205
\]

Tom has 30 points, and we need to find out how many points he has collected. Since we already know Tom's points, we can now calculate the total points collected by the class:
\[
\text{Total points collected by the class} = 205 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the number of points the class is missing is:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 235 = 165
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{165}

"First, we need to determine how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account. 

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement account} = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for this purpose.

\[ \text{Amount used for car payment} = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Amount left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings/female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 \text{ dumplings/female} + 1 \text{ dumpling} = 4 \text{ dumplings/male} \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings/male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, we get the total number of dumplings cooked:

\[ 18 \text{ dumplings} + 32 \text{ dumplings} = 50 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received from the $100 based on the given ratio of 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the value of each part by dividing the total amount of money by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we can find out how much money each person received:
- Gerald's share:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
- Julia's share:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Gerald initially had $60. He then spent $10 on a book. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial amount:
\[ 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Thus, the final amount of money Gerald has left is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5:

\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:

\[
\text{Distance the turtle can crawl} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to raise the remaining amount to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining amount to be raised:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount raised so far} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200
   \]

2. Determine the amount raised per hour:
   \[
   \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Amount raised so far}}{\text{Hours already fundraised}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700
   \]

3. Calculate the number of additional hours needed to raise the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6
   \]

4. Add the initial hours to the additional hours to find the total hours needed:
   \[
   \text{Total hours needed} = \text{Initial hours} + \text{Additional hours needed} = 3 + 6 = 9
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours the firefighters need to raise the remaining amount is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water that Colorado City uses for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes (32%) from the total percentage used by Colorado City:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water that Colorado City uses for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."
"To determine how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily charge.

First, we know that one week has 7 days. Therefore, two weeks will have:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that Alex charges $12 per day. So, for 14 days, the total charge will be:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ dollars/day} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"First, let's determine the production rate for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The production rate is 50 quarts per hour.
- In 48 hours, the total production is:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]

For vanilla ice cream:
- The production rate is 12.5 quarts per hour.
- In 48 hours, the total production is:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: \(5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = \$13.00\)

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of \$50.00:

\[
0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Thus, Marcus' total bill is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. The deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so the cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00, we divide $6.00 by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops Erin should buy is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's determine how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in a day and then over the course of two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Over two weeks (14 days), Ginger will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Over two weeks (14 days), Amy will eat:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy have 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the remaining candy for Ginger and Amy will be:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

The difference in the amount of candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks is:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

1. **Fixed fee**: $20
2. **Variable fee**: $1.5 per pound
3. **Weight of blueberries picked**: 30 pounds

The variable fee can be calculated as:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the fixed fee to the variable fee gives the total cost for picking the blueberries:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars} + 45 \, \text{dollars} = 65 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound.

The total cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ 75 \, \text{dollars} - 65 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the amount James saved is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the total planned cost was:

\[
500 \times 700 = 350,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the new price of each computer, which is 10% higher than the original price. The original price per computer is $700. A 10% increase in the price is calculated as:

\[
700 \times 0.10 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the new price per computer is:

\[
700 + 70 = 770 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[
500 \times 770 = 385,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

   - Sum the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham:
   \[
   450 \text{ calories (eggs)} + 240 \text{ calories (cheese)} + 80 \text{ calories (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in the omelet is \(\boxed{770}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils:

\[
6 \text{ pencils} \times \$0.50 \text{ per pencil} = 6 \times 0.50 = \$3.00
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers. Each eraser costs $0.25, and you bought 8 erasers:

\[
8 \text{ erasers} \times \$0.25 \text{ per eraser} = 8 \times 0.25 = \$2.00
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the pencils and the total cost of the erasers to find the overall total cost:

\[
\$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00
\]

You paid $10 for the items. To find the change you would receive, subtract the total cost from the amount you paid:

"First, we need to determine how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of these interviewees receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Then, we need to determine how many of these job offer recipients accept the position. Since a third of the job offer recipients accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, 2 people accept the position.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of sacks Goldy gave to her cousin and brother:

Sacks given to cousin: 3
Sacks given to brother: 4

Total sacks given = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the rice given away. Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, we can find the total weight by multiplying the total number of sacks given away by the weight per sack:

Total weight = 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg

So, the total kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother is 175 kg.

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she taps her feet.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.

For 3 minutes (since she dances a total of 5 minutes with her arms raised for 2 minutes, she dances with her arms at her sides for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes):
\[
550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.

For 2 minutes:
\[
400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}
\]

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to find the total number of taps:
\[
1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}
\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Ron if he decides to fix the pothole himself.

1. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance:**
   \[
   \text{Fine} = \$120
   \]

2. **Cost of asphalt:**
   - Each bucket of asphalt costs \$25.
   - Ron needs 3 buckets.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of asphalt} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Fine} + \text{Total cost of asphalt} = \$120 + \$75 = \$195
   \]

Next, we compare this cost to the potential damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed.

4. **Damage to the car:**
   \[
   \text{Damage} = \$450
   \]

5. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we find the total number of slices eaten by all five friends:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we determine the number of slices left by subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoes are 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. Therefore, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows. So, the number of windows she smashes from the students' cars is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows. So, the number of windows she smashes from the teachers' cars is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars, we get the total number of windows smashed by Hannah:

"First, we need to determine the total number of spools of thread Candy has. We do this by summing the number of spools of each color:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} = 150 \text{ spools}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools. This includes both the light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
\]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now, calculate the percentage:

\[
\left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of her spools that are blue is:

\[
\boxed{40\%}

"First, we need to determine how many people had voted by midday. Since 5000 people lined up at 8:00 and 2/5 of them had voted by midday, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of people who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

Next, we find out how many people were still waiting to vote by midday:

\[
\text{Remaining people by midday} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000
\]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 people:

\[
\text{Number of people who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000

"First, let's determine the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. So, the total number of smores needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 2 \text{ smores per adult} = 18 + 12 = 30 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 30 smores. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores, we calculate the number of sleeves needed as follows:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3.75 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since we can't buy a fraction of a sleeve, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 4 sleeves of graham crackers.

Now, we need to determine how many boxes of graham crackers are required. Each box contains 3 sleeves, so we calculate the number of boxes needed as follows:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1.3333 \text{ boxes} \]

Again, since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 2 boxes of graham crackers.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Dora's age.
2. Calculate Dora's father's age.
3. Calculate Dora's mother's age.
4. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Given:
- Dora's age = 15 years.
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.

First, calculate Dora's father's age:
\[
\text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \text{ years}
\]

Next, calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[
\text{Dora's mother's age} = \text{Dora's father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \text{ years}
\]

Now, sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Dora's father's age} + \text{Dora's mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[
\boxed{87}

- Math book: 2 pounds
- Science book: 2 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice as much as her English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Next, we sum the weights of all the books:

\[
2 \text{ (math)} + 2 \text{ (science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)}
\]

Adding these weights together:

\[
2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17

"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Given that candidate A got 20% of the votes, and there were 100 voters in total, we can calculate the votes for candidate A as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[
\text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10
\]

\[
\text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

Now, we sum the votes received by candidates A and B to find the total number of votes they received together:

\[
\text{Total votes for candidates A and B} = 20 + 30 = 50
\]

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[
\text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Boris has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to calculate the new number of apples each person has after this exchange.

Boris's new number of apples:

\[
\text{Boris's new apples} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

Beck's new number of apples:

\[
\text{Beck's new apples} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[
\text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

For the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

For the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used: \( 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \) ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
- Water left: \( 32 - 30 = 2 \) ounces.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of books Steven has:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. Therefore, we calculate the difference:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Thus, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total costs of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[
\boxed{98}

"First, let's determine the number of students who like to play music. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. We know the total number of students in the class is 50. The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number of students who like to play basketball is 5. The rest of the students like to play video games or play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students minus the number of students who like to bake and the number of students who like to play basketball:

\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

"First, we determine how many birds were scared away by Jeremy throwing the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away \(\frac{1}{3}\) of them:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[
8 + 20 = 28
\]

Thus, the final number of birds in the backyard is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   - We subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

- The cost for each adult at the first park is $26.
- The cost for each child at the first park is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

Total cost for adults at the first park:
\[ 2 \times 26 = 52 \]

Total cost for children at the first park:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Total cost for the first amusement park:
\[ 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult at the second park is $14.
- The cost for each child at the second park is $10.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

Total cost for adults at the second park:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

Total cost for children at the second park:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Total cost for the second amusement park:
\[ 28 + 20 = 48 \]

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week by switching to the new vendor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Calculate the weekly savings.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each and now buys them for $0.4 each. The daily savings per tomato is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.1 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, the daily savings in total is:
\[ 500 \times 0.1 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings is:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"To determine how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify how many marbles Sean has.
2. Use the information about Sean's marbles to find out how many marbles Carl has.
3. Use the information about Sean's marbles to find out how many marbles Cal has.
4. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have to get the final answer.

Step 1: Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 2: Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we calculate Carl's marbles as follows:
\[
\text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Step 3: Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can find Cal's marbles by doubling Sean's marbles:
\[
\text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Step 4: Now, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have:
\[
\text{Combined marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the 54 students were divided into 12 groups.

We start by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]
Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 equal groups. Therefore, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to make the division possible.

Next, we need to find the smallest number of groups that can be formed with 54 students such that each group has an equal number of students. This means we need to find the smallest divisor of 54 that is greater than 6 (since 6 groups were initially considered).

The divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. The smallest divisor greater than 6 is 9. If we form 9 groups, each group will have:
\[
\frac{54}{9} = 6 \text{ students}
\]
This is a valid division. Since we already have 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 9 groups. The number of additional groups needed is:
\[
9 - 12 = -3
\]
Since it is not possible to have a negative number of additional groups, we conclude that 12 groups are already more than the required 9 groups. Therefore, no additional groups are needed.

The number of additional groups needed is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in one week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
  \[
  5 \times 60 + 2 \times 100 = 300 + 200 = 500
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in one 4-week period:
- Since one week has 500 chairs rented, in 4 weeks, the total number of chairs rented is:
  \[
  4 \times 500 = 2000
  \]

Finally, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week periods:
- Since 2000 chairs are rented in one 4-week period, in two 4-week periods, the total number of chairs rented is:
  \[
  2 \times 2000 = 4000
  \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is \(\boxed{4000}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many bananas Gunther found in the pile.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther initially had 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half:**
   Arnold stole half of the bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24

   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals another 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 more bananas.
   \[

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost for electricity for all roommates.
2. Calculate the total annual cost for electricity for all roommates.
3. Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay per year.

Step 1: Calculate the total monthly cost for electricity for all roommates.
The monthly cost for electricity is $100 per roommate, and there are 4 roommates.
\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 100 \times 4 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total annual cost for electricity for all roommates.
There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual cost is:
\[ \text{Total annual cost} = 400 \times 12 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate will pay per year.

So, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{1200}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent out.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses
- 4 dozen plates

Since 1 dozen equals 12 items, we can calculate the total number of each item as follows:

\[
8 \text{ dozen glasses} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
\]
\[
4 \text{ dozen plates} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
\]

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken. Jeff received:
- 10 broken glasses
- 6 broken plates

To find out how many glasses and plates are left, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:

\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
\]

Finally, we sum the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:

\[
\text{Total remaining items} = 86 \text{ glasses} + 42 \text{ plates} = 128 \text{ items}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \)
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her remaining large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \)
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons.
   - Number of small buttons from remaining large stickers: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)
   - Remaining small stickers: 3
   - Total small buttons: \( 60 + 3 = 63 \)

1. Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. Joey played 1 match on Friday.
3. Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we sum the matches played each day:

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

   \[
   \text{Number of XS shirts} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of S shirts} = 2 \times \text{Number of XS shirts} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of M shirts} = \text{Number of S shirts} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of L shirts} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of M shirts} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of XL shirts} = \text{Number of L shirts} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 5\% \text{ of } \$140 = 0.05 \times 140 = \$7 \]

Next, subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ \text{Final price} = \$140 - \$7 = \$133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{133} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists.
2. Determine the total duration of all the songs combined.

First, we find the total number of songs in all 20 playlists:
\[
300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs}
\]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all the songs combined. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:
\[
6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total duration of the 20 playlists is:
\[
\boxed{60000}

"First, we need to determine the number of people who think horse #2 will win. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This means the remaining number of people is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. Given that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This means the rest of the people, who think horse #12 will win, is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we need to work through the information step by step.

1. Let \( P \) represent the total number of Pomeranian puppies.
2. According to the problem, one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}P = 6
   \]
3. To find the total number of Pomeranian puppies \( P \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   P = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
4. The problem states that two thirds of Jana's total puppies are Pomeranian. Let \( T \) represent the total number of puppies Jana has. Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}T = 18
   \]
5. To find the total number of puppies \( T \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

Thus, the total number of puppies Jana has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister has an allowance of $90. Half of this amount is:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Jayden receives $45 from his sister. Adding this to the $70 he already had, we get:
\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The cost of the new camera is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the camera:
\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Thus, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x
\]

So, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 500
\]

Then, divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 100
\]

Now, we know the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[
2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100
\]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pears George has.
2. Add the number of pears to the number of bananas.

First, we know that George has 45% more pears than bananas. Given that George has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 0.45 \times \text{Number of bananas} \]
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200 \]
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 \]
\[ \text{Number of pears} = 290 \]

Now, we add the number of pears to the number of bananas to find the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears} \]
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 200 + 290 \]
\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = 490 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits George has is \(\boxed{490}\)."

"To determine how much money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
2. Calculate the cost of the oranges needed.

First, we know that 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, the amount of oranges needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
\[ 20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Sam would have to spend to make 4 liters of juice is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of books Ahmed read.
2. Calculate the total number of books Ezra read.
3. Calculate the total number of books Ezra will read after reading 150 more books.
4. Sum the books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Therefore, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing the number of books Ezra read by 2:

\[
\text{Books Ahmed read} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books Ezra will read in total. Ezra initially read 300 books and decided to read 150 more books:

\[
\text{Total books Ezra will read} = 300 + 150 = 450
\]

Now, we sum the books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

\[
\text{Total books read by both} = \text{Books Ezra read} + \text{Books Ahmed read} = 450 + 150 = 600
\]

Thus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed is:

\[
\boxed{600}

"To determine how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Total hours taught on Monday: \(4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} = 20 \text{ hours}\).
- Total earnings from teaching hours: \(20 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$300\).
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day.
- Additional earnings for Monday: \$5.
- Total earnings for Monday: \$300 + \$5 = \$305.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Total hours taught on Wednesday: \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}\).
- Total earnings from teaching hours: \(4 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$60\).
- Since she teaches 2 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.
- Total earnings for Wednesday: \$60.

**Total earnings for the two days:**
- Total earnings for Monday: \$305.
- Total earnings for Wednesday: \$60.
- Combined total earnings: \$305 + \$60 = \$365.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:
\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the amount he has already made from $135:
\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

"First, let's determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Anthony initially had 50 pencils and he gave 1/2 of them to Brandon:

\[
\text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. We calculate 3/5 of 25:

\[
\text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[
\text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. To find the total time Jack is gone from home, we add the total driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[
\text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each car. Since he has 57 cars:
\[ 4 \text{ wheels/car} \times 57 \text{ cars} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle. Since he has 73 motorcycles:
\[ 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} \times 73 \text{ motorcycles} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after using 374 wheels, we subtract the total number of wheels used from the number of wheels in the box:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ \boxed{276} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many of Mike's 600 movies are in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[
\frac{600}{3} = 200
\]

So, there are 200 movies in series. This means the number of movies that are not in series is:

\[
600 - 200 = 400
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older, we calculate:

\[
0.4 \times 400 = 160
\]

So, there are 160 older movies. The number of movies that are not older movies (and thus are not in series) is:

\[
400 - 160 = 240
\]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of replacing the movies. The cost of the series movies is $6 each, and the cost of the normal movies is $10 each. The cost of the older movies is $5 each. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
200 \times 6 + 240 \times 10 + 160 \times 5
\]

We can calculate each term separately:

\[
200 \times 6 = 1200
\]
\[
240 \times 10 = 2400
\]
\[
160 \times 5 = 800
\]

Adding these amounts together gives:

\[
1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400
\]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:

\[
\boxed{4400}

"To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of peaches:**
   - Price per pound of peaches: $2.00
   - Pounds of peaches picked: 6 pounds
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Cost of plums:**
   - Price per pound of plums: $1.00
   - Pounds of plums picked: 8 pounds
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Cost of apricots:**
   - Price per pound of apricots: $3.00
   - Pounds of apricots picked: 6 pounds
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$18.00 \)

Next, we sum the costs for all the fruits:
\[
\$12.00 \text{ (peaches)} + \$8.00 \text{ (plums)} + \$18.00 \text{ (apricots)} = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Winston spent on fruit is \(\boxed{38}\)."
"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both driving and hiking.

First, let's find the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The average driving speed was 50 miles per hour. Therefore, half of the driving speed is:
\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
So, the hiking speed is:
\[
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by driving. They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour:
\[
\text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance traveled by hiking. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[
\text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance to the vacation spot is:
\[
\boxed{330}

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \) and the number of berries Emma collects as \( B_e \). Then, Ava jumps on \( E_a = E_e + 8 \) enemies and collects \( B_a = B_e + 3 \) berries. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T_a = T_e - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

The score for Emma is:
\[ S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

The score for Ava is:
\[ S_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e - 4) \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e - 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 5 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \Delta S = S_a - S_e \]
\[ \Delta S = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 5) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) \]
\[ \Delta S = 5 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we start by noting the total cost of the four pizzas and the cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of these pizzas cost 30 dollars each. Therefore, the combined cost of these two pizzas is:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the cost of the other two pizzas together is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- There are 5 usual days in a week.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ times/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ times} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these two days, they ride their bikes twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of times they ride their bikes is 3 times a day.
- Therefore, on these two days, they ride their bikes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) times a day.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ times/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times} \]

Now, we add the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ times} + 12 \text{ times} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). According to the problem, the total number of fish Bob bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding the new fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). The problem states that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Andy drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, he makes a round trip each day. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round trip distance is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, the total distance driven in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties and quarters.

Carrie has ten twenties. Each twenty is worth $20, so the total amount in twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie has 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount in quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money spent is the sum of the money spent on quarters and the money spent on twenties:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes Ricardo can get from his tomato plants. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants Ricardo can get from his eggplant plants. Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants. Therefore, the total number of eggplants is:

\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of tomatoes and the number of eggplants:

\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then find the remaining number of TVs, which are OLED TVs.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
   \]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is \(\boxed{25}\)."

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the temperature during the night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the temperature during the night is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."

"First, we need to determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate. Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

The special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Jamie worked at her regular rate and how many hours she worked at her special rate. Jamie worked a total of 11 hours, and since her regular workday is 8 hours, she worked 3 additional hours at the special rate.

So, she worked 8 hours at her regular rate and 3 hours at her special rate. We can now calculate her total earnings for the day:
\[ \text{Earnings from regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from special hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money Mike will have left over after buying the jeans, subtract the sale price from the $50.00:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Calculate the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. With 260 employees, the total salary paid each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.**

The total salary paid over three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, hourly wage:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, hourly wage:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Earnings for the first 2 months (20 hours):**
   \[
   20 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$200
   \]
2. **Earnings for the next 2 months (20 hours):**
   \[
   20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
   \]
3. **Earnings for the first anniversary (20 hours):**
   \[
   20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives Billy's total earnings over the first 6 months:
\[
\$200 + \$210 + \$230 = \$640
\]

Now, let's find Sally's hourly wage:
1. **Sally's starting hourly wage:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210

"To determine the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the points scored by Pierson.
2. Calculate the points scored by Nikita.
3. Add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita.

First, we know that Pierson scored 278 points. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Points scored by Pierson} = 278 \]

Next, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. We can express this mathematically as:
\[ \text{Points scored by Nikita} = \frac{1}{2} \times 278 + 11 \]

Now, we calculate half of Pierson's points:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 278 = 139 \]

Then, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points. Now, we add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita to find the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and teachers.

Each student plants 1 tree:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Thus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:

"First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of goats to be 30%, so we set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( 14 + x \):
\[ x = 0.30 (14 + x) \]

Next, we distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Now, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Finally, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Thus, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she played during the first 2 weeks is:
\[
14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she played during the second week is:
\[
7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours}
\]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[
7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours}
\]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[
30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car's speed is 60 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the first car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car's speed is 70 miles per hour.
- The time is 2 hours.

\[
\text{Distance traveled by the second car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:

\[
\text{Difference in distance} = \text{Distance traveled by the second car} - \text{Distance traveled by the first car} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is:

\[

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost of the ring to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade.

For the third graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for third graders} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \]

For the fourth graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \]

For the fifth graders, the pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fifth graders} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

Total number of students:
\[ 500 \text{ (third graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Total number of students who passed:
\[ 340 \text{ (third graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth graders)} = 780 \text{ students} \]

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate for the entire school:
\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \]

To express this as a percentage:
\[ 0.78 \times 100 = 78\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is:
\[ \boxed{78\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he needs to sell 150 more to have sold all of his initial order. After that, he ordered 100 more candies. Therefore, the total number of candies he has now is:

\[ 100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (new order)} = 200 \text{ candies} \]

Since he has already sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell to have all 200 candies sold is:

\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed:**
   Felix made $105 by climbing branches. Each branch costs $0.25.
   \[
   \text{Total number of branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]
   So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches.

3. **Calculate the number of days he worked:**
   We know that he made $105 during the week. Assuming a week has 7 days, we can find the number of days he worked by dividing the total earnings by the number of days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Earnings per day}} = \frac{105}{7} = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days.
   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{15}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**

   \]

2. She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. She picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean each need one marshmallow for each S'more, and they have 14 marshmallows left, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the play times for each friend:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
2. Two friends can only play half as long as Jack, so each of these friends can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes with one quarter.
3. One friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes with one quarter.

Next, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends combined:

- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes, so together they play for \(10 + 10 = 20\) minutes.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these together, the total play time is:
\[ 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many quarters are required to play for 70 minutes. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we divide the total play time by 20:
\[ \frac{70}{20} = 3.5 \]

Since Jack and his friends can only use whole quarters, they will need to use 4 quarters to cover the 70 minutes of play.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( C = F \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \), and \( C = F \), it follows that \( S = F \). Therefore, we can substitute \( C \) and \( F \) with \( S \) in the equations.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + C + F + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships:
\[ S + O + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 4S + O = 10 \]

We also know from the relationship \( O = 2S \):
\[ 4S + 2S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we can find \( O \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil used is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost of the goats. John buys 3 goats at $500 each:

\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows. John buys 2 cows at $1500 each:

\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

So, the total amount of money John spent is:

\[ \boxed{4500} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Paul already has. He has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Adding these together gives:

"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Sum the time walked on both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we add the time walked on both days to find the total time in hours:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

   \]

3. When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, half of the cars had left. Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks John completes in one day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of money John earns in one day:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money John earns in one day is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know \( P \), we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

1. **Green Eggs:**
   Cindy has 5 green eggs.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   Cindy has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs to find the total number of eggs Cindy has:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Thus, the total number of eggs Cindy has is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we will find the difference between the shipping cost and the refund amount.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The cost for the weight is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost for the distance is \(20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Calculate the refund amount from Amazon:**
   - The purchase price of the book is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \(32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
   - The net loss is \(3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars}\).

Since the net loss is a negative value, it means Milly will actually gain $21.00. However, the question asks for the final numerical answer in terms of loss, which is the absolute value of the net loss.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract this from the total monthly production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Boris produces the remaining bars of chocolate in the fourth week.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}

"First, let's calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week.

Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
\[ 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes per video} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time Britany spends writing amateur songs each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time Britany spends doing her makeup each week. She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. Therefore, the total time spent on makeup each week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes per day} \times 6 \text{ days per week} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding up all the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup each week, we get:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1128 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{18.8} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

2. **Additional Items Calculation:**
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base cost already includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, the additional items Angela needs are:
     - \(6 - 4 = 2\) additional mirrors
     - \(2 - 1 = 1\) additional chandelier
     - \(20 - 10 = 10\) additional pictures

3. **Cost for Additional Items:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for the additional mirrors is:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost for the additional chandelier is:
     \[
     1 \times 15 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost for the additional pictures is:
     \[
     10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Additional Cost:**
   - Sum the costs of the additional items:
     \[
     30 + 15 + 150 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Add the base cost to the total additional cost:
     \[
     129 + 195 = 324 \text{ dollars}
     \]

"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to determine how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00

"First, we calculate the distance Mason travels in the first part of his journey. He travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the second part of his journey. He travels at the same rate of 8 miles per hour for 6 hours:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total distance traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \( t \):
     \[
     D = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = \text{total money} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total money she has is $400 - $50 = $350. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"First, let's determine how much milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows.

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. With 3 cows, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed, we first determine the additional milk required:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, so the number of additional cows needed is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. **First Glue Stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \) millimeters

2. **Second Glue Stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) millimeters

3. **Third Glue Stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) millimeters

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{20}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:
\[
10000 + 800 = 10800
\]

Next, let's determine the total amount of money Gabriel has:
\[
5000 + 200 = 5200
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the amount he has from the total cost:
\[
10800 - 5200 = 5600
\]

So, the final amount of money Gabriel still needs is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills. 

\[
4 \times 20 = 80
\]

The total amount of money Thea gave is $80.

Next, we need to find out how much change she received. The hat cost $70, so we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money Thea gave.

\[
80 - 70 = 10
\]

Therefore, the change Thea received is $10.

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig has to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, then Jack has 60/2 = 30 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60/2 = 30 dishes.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30*2 = 60 socks.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 30+30+60+30 = 150.

The final answer is 150."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given and use it to fill in the Venn diagram.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, let's denote:
- \( M \) as the set of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the set of students good at English.
- \( |M| \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( |E| \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( |M \cap E| \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of students good at math only is 5.
- The number of students good at English only is 8.
- The number of students good at both math and English is \( |M \cap E| \).

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students good at math only, students good at English only, and students good at both subjects:
\[ |M \cup E| = 5 + 8 + |M \cap E| \]

Since the total number of students is 20, we have:
\[ 5 + 8 + |M \cap E| = 20 \]

Solving for \( |M \cap E| \):
\[ 13 + |M \cap E| = 20 \]
\[ |M \cap E| = 20 - 13 \]
\[ |M \cap E| = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math (\( |M| \)), we add the number of students good at math only to the number of students good at both math and English:
\[ |M| = 5 + |M \cap E| \]
\[ |M| = 5 + 7 \]
\[ |M| = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit, as well as the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the 10-minute intermission to the performance time:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many groups can fit into the 120 minutes:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ percent per year}
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for 3 years:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 225 \times 3
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   I = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount (A) after 3 years:**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A = 300 + 202500 = 202800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{202800}

"First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars and the number of white shirts without collars.

- Total white shirts: 40
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and the number of floral shirts without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts without collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

The difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts without collars.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the farmer will earn:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of goats sold from each farm.

From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X. Therefore, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of goats remaining in each farm after the sales.

For Farm X:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

For Farm Y:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a $2 discount on each basket of red food, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the green food is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. Calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You are getting a $2 discount on each basket of red food, so each basket costs:
     \[
     18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. Calculate the total cost for all the baskets:
   - Add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food:
     \[
     75 + 48 = 123 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.**

There are 90 rooms in total, and we need to clean one-half of them:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes.**

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, for 45 rooms:
\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.**

There are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert 900 minutes to hours:
\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time required to clean one-half of the rooms is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. In the third year, the town builds double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   Then, the number of homes built in the third year is:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144
\]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( S \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( B \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( M \) be my mom's age.
- Let \( Y \) be my age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. I am three years younger than my brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. I am two years older than my sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of our ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), we get \( M = 3(B - 3) - 1 = 3B - 10 \).

Now substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + (Y - 2) + (3B - 10) = 87. \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ Y + B + Y - 2 + 3B - 10 = 87, \]
\[ 2Y + 4B - 12 = 87. \]
Add 12 to both sides:
\[ 2Y + 4B = 99. \]
Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ Y + 2B = 49.5. \]
Since \( Y \) and \( B \) are ages, they must be integers. The equation \( Y + 2B = 49.5 \) suggests that there might be a need to recheck the integer constraints, but given the problem setup, we can infer that the integer solution should fit the equation closely. Let's test integer values for \( B \) and solve for \( Y \).

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To verify, we can calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, and he will have 2 extra glue sticks, 7 packs is the correct number. Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to follow the changes in the water flow day by day.

1. **Initial amount of water on the first day:**
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Amount of water on the second day:**
   The amount of water doubles from the first day.
   \[
   4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Amount of water on the third day:**
   The amount of water increases by 6000 gallons from the second day.
   \[
   8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to follow the infection process day by day.

**Day 0 (initial state):**
- Number of infected people: \(10\)

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we calculate:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800
\]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received in tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips:

\[
0.10 \times 800 = 80
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 - 80 = 720
\]

Now, we add the tips received by Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of money they received altogether:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520
\]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\). 

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

\[
12 - 9 = 3
\]

So, Jennifer remained with \(\boxed{3}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ badges/year} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. Therefore, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ badge}}{2 \text{ months}} = 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \]
In a year, Amber earns:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 6 \text{ badges/year} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges/year} = 36 \text{ badges/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges/year} - 6 \text{ badges/year} = 30 \text{ badges/year} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**

Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, the total number of loaves baked is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.**

Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. The total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship with the equation:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

Given that \( G = 70 \), we substitute 70 for \( G \) in the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find \( S \), we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of burritos distributed to the students. Each of the 50 students was given 10 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos distributed to the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos that were given out (either to the students or eaten by Mr. George) is:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

George originally ordered 600 burritos. To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos given out from the original number of burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

1. **Red Cars:**
   The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:**
   The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Blue Cars:**
   The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the total number of these three types of cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Subtract 37 from both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):

\[
3A = 48
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = 16
\]

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can find out how many books Fawn has. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne:

\[
A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\]"
"First, we determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes, and the bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds, we calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[
\text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"First, we need to determine the total number of small jello cups Greg wants to make. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of flavored jello are required to make 120 jello cups. We know that one box makes 10 jello cups, so the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Greg will spend on jello is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much change the seller will give back after receiving $4000. We subtract the total cost of the phones from the $4000 given by the seller:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the seller will give back \(\boxed{500}\) dollars in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost that Madeline pays.
2. Determine the total monthly cost that Keenan pays.
3. Calculate the weekly cost that Keenan pays.

First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month. Madeline pays 60% of this amount. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, the amount Keenan pays is:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the weekly cost for Keenan is:
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount Keenan spends per week is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day. Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first day:

\[
60 - 24 = 36
\]

Next, Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \(\frac{7}{13}\) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14
\]

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day. Now, we can find the total number of pieces he has eaten so far by adding the pieces he ate on the first, second, and third days:

\[
24 + 10 + 14 = 48
\]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:

\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

For the soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is \(\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00\).

For the water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is \(\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00\).

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03.

\[

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

\[
\text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
\]

So, the final amount of money David has left after buying the bolts is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}

"First, we need to determine Ella's rate of pay per hour. We know that she earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33 \text{ dollars}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn for 12 hours of work at this hourly rate. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 132 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles. Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gives him an additional 28 marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving the marbles from his friend is:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the marbles from his friend:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
\]
So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000
\]
The total revenue from selling the chickens is $9000.

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]
Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as \( M \). Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold \( M \) glasses.

The total number of glasses sold can be expressed as:
\[ 14 + M + M = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2M = 32 \]

Next, we solve for \( M \):
\[ 2M = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2M = 18 \]
\[ M = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ M = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each service:

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the cost of the hairdo:
   \[

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how much money Sarah will have left after buying the rope. Since she has $40 and she spends all of it on the rope, she will have:

\[
\text{Money left} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah plans to use the $40 profit to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of rope she can buy with $40, we divide the total money by the cost per meter:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters is:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

After buying the 26 meters of new rope, the money left over is:

\[
\text{Money left} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine how many years from now Melanie's age will be thrice her present age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for her age in \( x \) years:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - We want her age in \( x \) years to be three times her current age.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation: 
     \[
     8 + x = 3 \times 8
     \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     8 + x = 24

"First, let's determine the cost of each item Kelly is buying.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of strawberries} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + (6 \times 4) + 12 + 14
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Thus, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of toys Argo gives away. He gives:

- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

To find the total number of toys given away, we add these amounts together:

\[
40 + 80 + 30 = 150
\]

Argo originally had 200 toys. After giving away 150 toys, the number of toys he has left is:

\[
200 - 150 = 50
\]

So, the final number of toys Argo has is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of chimichangas made on each day:
   - On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

2. Calculate the total number of chimichangas made over the three days:
   - Tuesday: 125 chimichangas
   - Wednesday: 125 chimichangas
   - Friday: 250 chimichangas

   Adding these together:
   \[
   125 + 125 + 250 = 500
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired.
3. Determine the number of pairs that can be formed with the remaining microphones.

First, we calculate 20% of the 50 microphones that won't find space:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 microphones won't be paired.

Next, we subtract these 10 microphones from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 microphones can be paired.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of birds flying overhead. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. According to the problem, 2/3 of that number of birds are flying overhead. We can calculate the number of birds flying overhead as follows:

\[
\text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. We can calculate the total number of birds feeding as follows:

\[
\text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:

\[ 40 \text{ petals (daisies)} - 25 \text{ petals (orchids)} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[
\text{Speed of the thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of the whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
\]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[
\text{Speed of the whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second}
\]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs Ellen incurs each day:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for these items each day is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. 

Mark's original hourly wage was $10. The raise was $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours per week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Thus, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6. Since \( x \) is the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, the payment for mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6x \).

The total payment from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments for mowing Joe's lawn, Kamala's lawn, and Alba's lawn:
\[ 6x + 3x + 5x = 14x \]

We know that the total amount Tasha made from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the amount she made from mowing lawns is $14x, and the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 14x \]

Since the payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6, we have:
\[ 6x = 6 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( x = 1 \) into the equation for the total payment from mowing lawns:
\[ 14x = 14 \times 1 = 14 \]

The amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 14 = 66 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[
\text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \text{ kg} = 55 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} = 71 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we need to find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[
\text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \text{ kg} = 71 \text{ kg} + 8 \text{ kg} = 79 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we need to determine Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[
\text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \text{ kg} = 79 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} = 74 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the weight of Harry is:

\[
\boxed{74}

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit by subtracting his monthly car payment from his monthly earnings:

\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

So, John's profit on his car is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many notebooks Martha originally had:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} + 5 = 7 \]

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final answer is:

"To determine the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Dijana rowed.
2. Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
3. Sum the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis.

First, we know that Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

Let's calculate the distance Anis rowed:
\[
\text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

   So, there are 96 cookies left.

2. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews:**
   We need to divide 96 cookies by 6 nephews.
   \[
   \frac{96}{6} = 16
   \]

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

**Denise's Reading:**
- Yesterday: 10 pages
- Today: 10 + 5 = 15 pages

**Daniel's Reading:**
- Yesterday: 13 pages
- Today: 0 pages

Next, we calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days.

**Denise's Total Pages:**
\[ 10 \text{ (yesterday)} + 15 \text{ (today)} = 25 \text{ pages} \]

**Daniel's Total Pages:**
\[ 13 \text{ (yesterday)} + 0 \text{ (today)} = 13 \text{ pages} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel.

\[ 25 \text{ (Denise's total)} - 13 \text{ (Daniel's total)} = 12 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of bowls that can be filled from the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can also fill 8 child's bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child's bowls).

4. **Calculate the number of leftover bowls:**
   - Total bowls needed: 4
   - Bowls that can be filled from the pot: 4
   - Leftover bowls: \( 4 - 4 = 0 \)

Since there are no leftover bowls, each child cannot have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought five notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.

\[
\text{Total cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought one ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.

\[
\text{Cost of the ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00

"First, let's determine the amount of material Jo needs to make one small mask and one large mask.

From the given information:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
  Therefore, the amount of material needed for one small mask is:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]

- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
  Therefore, the amount of material needed for one large mask is:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks:
\[
20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

Then, we calculate the total material needed for 8 large masks:
\[
8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks is:

"First, let's determine how much time Harold spends on each activity:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Harold's total day is 24 hours. To find out how much free time he has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Duncan's age eight years ago:**
   Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 52
   \]

2. **Express Adam's age four years ago in terms of Adam's current age:**
   Let Adam's current age be \( A \). Four years ago, Adam's age was:
   \[
   A - 4
   \]

3. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   According to the problem, eight years ago Duncan's age (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]

4. **Solve for Adam's current age \( A \):**
   First, divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
   Next, add 4 to both sides to isolate \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
   So, Adam's current age is 30.

5. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   If Adam is currently 30 years old, in 8 years he will be:
   \[
   30 + 8 = 38

Substituting the value of \( R \) (which is 20) into the equation:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( Y = 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, we need to determine how many miles Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, the total miles driven in a month is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups Jon needs for 3000 miles. Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Let's calculate the number of hours Bruce works each day:

- On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked over the three days:

\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is 23."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

1. **Tennis:**
   There are 6 students playing tennis.

2. **Volleyball:**
   There are twice the number of students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis. Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

3. **Soccer:**
   There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. The total number of students playing soccer is:
   \[
   16 + 22 = 38
   \]

Next, we sum the number of students playing each sport to find the total number of students:

\[
6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56
\]

Thus, the total number of students is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of pet Larry has.

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Adding these together:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"First, let's determine how many slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Next, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices.

To find the number of days, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices eaten per day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"Martha collects shells every month. She started collecting at age 5 and her 10th birthday marks the end of her collection period. 

First, we calculate the number of years she collected shells:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ years} \]

Next, we determine the number of months in those 5 years:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cups in each row:**
   Lana has 27 cups of tea and divides them into 3 rows. Therefore, the number of cups in each row is:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9
   \]
   So, each row contains 9 cups of tea.

2. **Determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row:**
   Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
   \]
   cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea.

3. **Verify the total number of cups of cinnamon tea:**
   Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. The remaining cups are:
   \[
   27 - (9 \times 2) = 27 - 18 = 9
   \]
   These 9 remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[
\boxed{4.5}

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the sloth takes 4 hours to complete one trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. We need to find out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we know that the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, we determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10000 gallons of water, the tank will contain:

\[
\frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days is:

\[
500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank, we subtract the total amount of water removed from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[
5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[
\boxed{2000}

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to account for the money he has already spent and the money he has left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent so far:
- He has $150 to spend each month.
- He has already spent money on 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days.
- He has already bought 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.

Let's break down the costs:
- Each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10.
- Each movie ticket on other days costs $7.
- Each tub of popcorn costs $8.
- Each box of candy costs $2.

Calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- For 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- For 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- Total cost for movies: \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars.

Calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- For 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- For 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Total cost for popcorn and candy: \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Now, add the costs of the movies and the popcorn and candy:
- Total spent so far: \(106 + 24 = 130\) dollars.

Subtract the total spent from the $150 he has:
- Money left: \(150 - 130 = 20\) dollars.

Now, determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining $20:
- Each movie ticket costs either $10 (Friday or Saturday) or $7 (other days).

To maximize the number of movies, Colby should see as many movies as possible on other days (since they are cheaper):
- If he sees 2 more movies on other days: \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.
- Money left after seeing 2 more movies on other days: \(20 - 14 = 6\) dollars.

With the remaining $6, he can see:
- 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday: \(1 \times 10 = 10\) dollars (but he only has $6, so he can only see 1 more movie on a Friday or Saturday).

Thus, the total number of additional movies he can see is:
- 2 movies on other days + 1 movie on a Friday or Saturday = 3 movies.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for each mini pastry as follows:

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   \[
   \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   \[
   \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:

3. **Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls:**
   \[
   \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Total calories from mini blueberry muffins:**
   \[
   \text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Finally, we sum the total calories from both types of pastries to get the overall total calories:

5. **Total calories from all pastries:**
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to determine the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

1. On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. Therefore, on each of these days, she removed \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, we add the numbers step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

Next, we find the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car. Using the same formula for distance:

For the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to determine the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

Here's the breakdown:
- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.
- Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys up to 62.

First, we calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls:
\[ 31 \text{ (blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Next, we know that after buying the bouncy balls, the total number of toys is 62. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls is:
\[ 62 \text{ (total toys now)} - 48 \text{ (toys before)} = 14 \text{ bouncy balls} \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the expression for \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's determine the initial number of water balloons each person had:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so each friend received \(2\) balloons.
- Maria herself received \(1\) water balloon.

So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding Maria's balloon:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons.

So, the total number of additional balloons given by her mom is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

1. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding the donated boxes to the already owned boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

4. Calculate the total number of tables needed:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. Calculate the number of new tables needed:

"First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet:

\[
40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet:

\[
35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the total distance both Zoey and Sydney spit their seeds combined:

\[
400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet}
\]

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):

\[
\frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the average total distance spat is:

\[
\boxed{410}

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total widget production for each machine, and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find the difference in revenue:
\[
\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800

Thus, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Thus, the amount of money Cameron would save is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

\[ \text{Earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Cost of gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = \text{Remaining after gas} - \text{Deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also wants to buy 5 pencils, each costing 10 dollars:

\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = \text{Remaining after deposit} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:

\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Cost per pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters that is 50 more than Craig's total. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:
\[
300 + 50 = 350
\]

To find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the two totals together:
\[
300 + 350 = 650
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[
\boxed{650}
\]"
"To determine the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply by the total number of rows.

1. **Number of children in one row:**
   Each row has 8 children.

2. **Number of rows per school:**
   Each school has 7 rows.

3. **Number of schools:**
   There are 5 different schools.

4. **Total number of rows:**
   To find the total number of rows, we multiply the number of rows per school by the number of schools:
   \[
   7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows}
   \]

5. **Total number of children:**
   To find the total number of children, we multiply the number of children in one row by the total number of rows:
   \[
   8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children}
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can obtain by redeeming all her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice required for the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed for the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles obtained from the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To determine the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to break down the cost into its components and then sum them up.

1. **Visit Fee**: Patty charges a flat fee of $40 for visiting the house.
2. **Labor Cost**: Patty charges $35 per hour for labor. The job took 2.25 hours.
   - First, we calculate the labor cost for the full hours: \(2\) hours at $35 per hour.
     \[
     2 \times 35 = 70
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the labor cost for the remaining 0.25 hours. Since labor is charged for part of an hour, we round up to the next whole hour (0.25 hours is more than half an hour).
     \[
     0.25 \times 35 = 8.75 \approx 9 \text{ (since we round up)}
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total labor cost:
     \[
     70 + 9 = 79
     \]
3. **Parts Cost**: The job used $60 in parts.

Now, we sum up all the components to find the total charge:
\[
40 \text{ (visit fee)} + 79 \text{ (labor cost)} + 60 \text{ (parts cost)} = 179
\]

Thus, the total charge Patty's Plumbing charged is:
\[
\boxed{179}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The value of these 5 CDs before the discount is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$75 \]

Since he sells these 5 CDs for $40, the loss from selling them is:

\[ \$75 - \$40 = \$35 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money James was out is the cost of the CDs after the discount minus the money he received from selling the 5 CDs:

\[ \$90 - \$40 = \$50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we calculate the earnings from the yams. Jen has 6 yams, and each yam can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the total earnings from the yams are:

\[ 6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = 6 \times 1.5 = \$9 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, and each sweet potato can be sold for $2. Therefore, the total earnings from the sweet potatoes are:

\[ 10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = 10 \times 2 = \$20 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the carrots. Jen has 4 carrots, and each carrot can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the total earnings from the carrots are:

\[ 4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = 4 \times 1.25 = \$5 \]

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops to find the total earnings:

\[ \$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34 \]

Thus, Jen will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars if she sells everything."
"First, we calculate the distance James swims. The total distance of the lake is 20 miles, and he swims 60% of the distance. Therefore, the distance he swims is:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we determine the time it takes for James to swim 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, the rest time is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim. The remaining distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new swimming speed is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time it takes for James to swim the remaining 8 miles at this speed is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we sum up the time taken for swimming, resting, and the final swimming to find the total time:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread the bakery had last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 

To find seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from this result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7 stickers, so she has:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

Thus, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Therefore, the total commission from the New York Times is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Therefore, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal
- Total commission = \( 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Thus, the total commission Cayley will earn is \(\boxed{15.00}\)."
"To determine Leo's age, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. We know that Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, Marcus's age is:
   \[
   26 - 5 = 21
   \]
3. Marcus is also half of Leo's age. Let \( L \) represent Leo's age. According to the information, Marcus's age (21) is half of Leo's age. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   21 = \frac{L}{2}
   \]
4. To find \( L \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   L = 21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

Thus, Leo is \(\boxed{42}\) years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45
\]
\[
3A + 30 = 45
\]
Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3A = 15
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
A = 5
\]
So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches of thickness:
\[
1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"First, we need to determine the total duration Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is:
- 11:00 PM - 12:00 AM = 1 hour
- 12:00 AM - 1:00 AM = 1 hour
- 1:00 AM - 2:00 AM = 1 hour
- 2:00 AM - 3:00 AM = 1 hour
- 3:00 AM - 4:00 AM = 1 hour
- 4:00 AM - 5:00 AM = 1 hour
- 5:00 AM - 6:00 AM = 1 hour
- 6:00 AM - 7:00 AM = 1 hour
- 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM = 1 hour
- 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM = 13 hours

So, the total duration is 13 hours.

Next, we need to convert the total duration into minutes:
\[ 13 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 780 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15 minutes are in 780 minutes:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/set}} = 52 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 15 minutes allows Vince to staple 30 reports, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 52 \text{ sets} \times 30 \text{ reports/set} = 1560 \text{ reports} \]

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[
\boxed{1560}
\]"
"First, let's determine Kim's usual sleep duration. She usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., which totals to 8 hours of sleep.

Next, we need to calculate the total time she slept on the bed that day. She usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. However, she woke up at 6 a.m. but was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. This means she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes.

Additionally, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. This means she was awake for 5 minutes before she went to the bathroom.

So, the total time she was awake that day is the time she was sleepwalking plus the time she was awake before going to the bathroom:
\[ 23 \text{ minutes (sleepwalking)} + 5 \text{ minutes (awake before bathroom)} = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time she was awake from her usual sleep duration to find out how many minutes she slept on her bed:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes (usual sleep duration)} - 28 \text{ minutes (awake)} = 452 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes she slept on her bed that day is:
\[ \boxed{452} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. The total number of utensils is:

\[ 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we need to account for the additional patients admitted due to the coronavirus outbreak. The hospital admits 50 new patients each day. Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Total new patients} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these new patients to the initial number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (which is 9 emails) are sent to her family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

So, Robyn sends 6 emails to her family. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These 3 emails are then divided such that one-third of them are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Thus, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- Holes dug on the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Holes dug on the third day before filling: 8
- Holes filled on the third day: 2

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 10 \]

Now, we calculate the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

We know that by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since the total number of holes at the end of the third day is 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To determine the total number of corn chips, we need to analyze the distribution of the chips among Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

1. **Identify the number of chips each person received:**
   - Amora received 70 chips.
   - Lainey received 70 chips.
   - Collins received 15 more chips than the number Amora and Lainey received.

2. **Calculate the number of chips Collins received:**
   - Since Amora and Lainey each received 70 chips, Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) chips.

3. **Sum the total number of chips:**
   - The total number of chips is the sum of the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.
   \[
   70 + 70 + 85 = 225
   \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the travel tickets. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \). According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \). Additionally, Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is given as 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
\]
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
\]
\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]
Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[
9A = 360
\]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[
A = 40
\]
So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan, which is \( 4A - 13 \):
\[
4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]
Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"To determine the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the length of each episode.
2. Determine the number of episodes based on the given relationship.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching the show.

Step 1: Identify the length of each episode.
Each episode is 20 minutes long.

Step 2: Determine the number of episodes.
The problem states that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is:
\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent watching the show.
To find the total time, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[
10 \times 20 = 200
\]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:
\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we sum the distances traveled in each segment to find the total distance between the northern and southern homes:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the brownies received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. We convert this to individual brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Finally, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all the racquets:
\[
45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"To determine the total cost of the phones, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first two phones are full price, and each subsequent phone is half price.

1. The price of the first phone is $600.
2. The price of the second phone is also $600.
3. The price of each subsequent phone is half of $600, which is $300.

John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

- The cost for the first 2 phones is:
  \[
  2 \times 600 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- The cost for the remaining 2 phones (each at half price) is:
  \[
  2 \times 300 = 600 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[
1200 + 600 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount John paid for the phones is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

"First, we need to determine the number of players on Zeke's baseball team. We know that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players.

To find the number of players on Zeke's team, we add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team:
\[
13 + 7 = 20
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of players on both teams combined. We do this by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:
\[
13 + 20 = 33
\]

Thus, the total number of players in both teams combined is:
\[
\boxed{33}

"To determine the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 15 feet
- Width = 10 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many wooden slats are required. Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of slats \( S \) required is:

\[
S = 2 \times P = 2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had. She bought 12 boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister. She gave each of them 2 boxes:
\[
2 \text{ boxes} + 2 \text{ boxes} = 4 \text{ boxes}
\]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she kept:
\[
12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes}
\]

Mrs. Harrington kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the oranges. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes}
\]

This means she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:
\[
8 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 5 \text{ boxes}
\]

Each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[
5 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 100 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}

4. **Find the total number of states in both countries:**
   - States in India: 29
   - States in USA: 50
   \[
   29 + 50 = 79
   \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 41 \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy these items. Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

\[ 41 - 14 = 27 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $27, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 27 \div 5 = 5.4 \]

Since Tyler can only work in whole hours, he needs to work 6 hours to earn at least $27. Therefore, the number of hours Tyler has to work is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cherries Richard has as follows:

\[
\text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
\]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[
\text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20
\]

Thus, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Price per box: $6
- Total boxes sold: 25
- Total earnings: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Price per box: $15
- Total boxes sold: 21
- Total earnings: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we sum the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

**Total earnings:**
- Gingerbread earnings: $150
- Apple pie earnings: $315
- Total: $150 + $315 = $465

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is \(\boxed{465}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use while on vacation. She is outside for 4 hours each day and re-applies an ounce of sunscreen every hour. Therefore, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over 8 days:

\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, it means the red car costs 60% of the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 \times (1 - 0.40) = 100 \times 0.60 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost of both cars. The total cost is the sum of the price of the red car and the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

We know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, the number of years that will have passed is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

At that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \). According to the problem, at that time, Emil's age will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

To find \( D \), we solve the equation:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that at the time Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. At that time, Emil's age will be 24, so his brother's age will be:
\[ 24 = 2B \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of beads each person gave to Adrianne.

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Therefore, the number of beads from her sister is:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]
3. Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Therefore, the number of beads from her friend is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Next, we sum the beads given by each person to find the total number of beads Adrianne has:

\[
20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90
\]

Thus, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has. Each serving is 3 pounds. Therefore, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the number of pounds per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[
0.20 \times 30 = 6
\]

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[
0.25 \times 24 = 6
\]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

The total number of students who will need to leave early is the sum of the football players and the students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[
6 + 6 = 12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Calculate the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie.

First, we know that Sophie's boots are size 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots, we calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:
\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:
\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots}}{2} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Therefore, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is:

\[
\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plant}} = 111 \text{ plants}
\]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant. If there are \( n \) plants, there will be \( n-1 \) spaces between them. The total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them is:

\[
111 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (111 - 1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} = 111 \text{ feet} + 110 \times 1.5 \text{ feet} = 111 \text{ feet} + 165 \text{ feet} = 276 \text{ feet}
\]

Since the flower bed is only 111 feet long, it is clear that Pat cannot fit 111 plants in the flower bed with the given spacing. We need to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the flower bed with the given spacing. Let \( n \) be the number of plants. The total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them is:

\[
n \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (n-1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} = 111 \text{ feet}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
n + 1.5(n-1) = 111
\]
\[
n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111
\]
\[
2.5n - 1.5 = 111
\]
\[
2.5n = 112.5
\]
\[
n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} = 45
\]

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy:

\[
45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants}
\]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:

\[
28 \times 6 = 168
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:

\[
\boxed{168}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by 7:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{63}

"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the flowers for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the flowers in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket. Each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = 3 \times 3 = \$9.00
  \]

- Katherine also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = 2 \times 2.50 = \$5.00
  \]

Next, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost per basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Katherine has 5 baskets, so we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times \$14.00 = 5 \times 14 = \$70.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, we need to determine the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used by the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used by the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations combined:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil available for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[
\text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money she has saved by the end of the year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12.

\[
\text{Yearly savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Each pair of fancy shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings, we divide her total savings by the cost of one pair of shoes.

\[
\text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
\]

Thus, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's determine how long it will take her to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[
\text{Time to saute 30 shrimp} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since Emily can peel and saute simultaneously, the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the longer of the two times calculated. In this case, it is 15 minutes.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It runs on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees} \).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It runs on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \( 3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees} \).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The air conditioner is turned off and the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It is turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \( 2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees} \).

4. **Net Change in Temperature:**
   - Total cooling: \( 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees} \).
   - Total warming: \( 4 \text{ degrees} \).
   - Net change in temperature: \( 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's father when he saw the Comet:**
   - Bill's father saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the orbital period of Comet Halley:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age difference between the two sightings:**
   - The time interval between the first and second sightings is \(90 - 30 = 60\) years.

5. **Determine the number of orbits Comet Halley completes in 60 years:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, in 60 years, it completes \(\frac{60}{75} = \frac{4}{5}\) of an orbit.

6. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time:**
   - Bill saw the Comet for the second time at age 90, which corresponds to \(\frac{4}{5}\) of an orbit.
   - Therefore, the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time is \(90 - 60 = 30\) years old.

Thus, Bill was \(\boxed{30}\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill Checks:**
   Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   \[
   \text{Electric Bill Checks per year} = 12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas Bill Checks:**
   Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   \[
   \text{Gas Bill Checks per year} = 12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church Checks:**
   Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   \[
   \text{Church Checks per year} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- The number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
- The number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \).
- The number of flights to Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in one day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can find the number of flights to France by calculating \( \frac{1}{4}F \):

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls in seconds:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[

"First, let's determine how much money Adam's father gave him. According to the problem, his father gave him twice as much as his mother. Since his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his mother and father from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the age of Wilfred, we start by defining the variables and using the given information.

Let the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred be denoted as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We know the following:
- \( A = 3 \)
- \( B = 4 \)
- The total age of the four children is 20.
- Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.

First, we calculate the total age of the four children:
\[
A + B + H + W = 20
\]
Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]
Simplifying this equation:
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]
Subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[
H + W = 13
\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[
10 + W = 13
\]
Solving for \( W \):
\[
W = 13 - 10 = 3
\]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. The friend is going to give Walter $200.

Now, let's calculate the total amount collected after including the contribution from the friend:
Total collected after friend's contribution: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. To find out how much the lawyer will donate, we need to determine the total amount collected from everyone else (excluding the lawyer's donation).

Let \( x \) be the amount collected from everyone else (excluding the lawyer's donation). The lawyer will donate \( 3x \).

The total amount collected is the sum of the contributions from everyone else and the lawyer's donation:
\[ x + 3x = 2200 \]
\[ 4x = 2200 \]
\[ x = \frac{2200}{4} \]
\[ x = 550 \]

The lawyer's donation is:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 550 = 1650 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute \(\boxed{1650}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[
100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
\]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[
\frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies}
\]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[
\frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people}
\]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the fraction of the watermelon that each adult and each child gets, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the fraction of the watermelon that each child gets as \( x \). Consequently, each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon.

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total fraction of the watermelon can be expressed as:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Since the total watermelon is considered as 1 (or 100%), we have:
\[ 8x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{8} \]

Now, each child gets \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) of the watermelon, and each adult gets \( 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the watermelon.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we convert the fraction \( \frac{1}{4} \) to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. Therefore, the time left for him to update his records is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"

2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

Now, we sum these times:
\[
20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[
180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we first need to find the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter combined. According to the problem, Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Adding these together gives:

\[3.5 + 4.5 = 8\]

So, they sold a total of 8 boxes of chocolate bars. We know that the total number of chocolate bars sold is 64. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

\[64 \div 8 = 8\]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost for renting the studio and the total revenue from the students per session, and then multiply by the number of days the studio is rented in a month.

1. **Calculate the cost per session:**
   - Cost to rent the studio: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total cost per session: $25 + ($1.50 × 10) = $25 + $15 = $40

2. **Calculate the number of sessions in a month:**
   - The studio is rented 3 days a week.
   - Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the number of sessions in a month is: 3 days/session × 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month

3. **Calculate the total earnings in a month:**
   - Total cost per session: $40
   - Number of sessions in a month: 12
   - Total earnings in a month: $40/session × 12 sessions/month = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.

\[
\boxed{480}

"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m \).

We are given:
- Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, so \( 7m = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( p \):
\[
4p = 64
\]
\[
p = \frac{64}{4}
\]
\[
p = 16
\]

Next, we solve for \( m \):
\[
7m = 56
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7}
\]
\[
m = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Now, we need to determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year. Initially, there are 50 porcupines. After a year, the number of porcupines will be the initial number plus the number of babies born:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given the dimensions:
- Width = 14 feet
- Length = 25 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
V = 14 \, \text{feet} \times 25 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet}
\]

\[
V = 14 \times 25 \times 4
\]

First, calculate \( 14 \times 25 \):

\[
14 \times 25 = 350
\]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[
350 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed:

\[
\text{Number of gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9
\]

\[
\text{Number of gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
\]

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[
C = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
\]

\[
C = 826 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[
\boxed{826}

"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. We know there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks:

\[
\text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
\]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

\[
\text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
\]

Now, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks to find the total number of sticks:

\[
\text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
\]

Thus, the total number of sticks is:

\[

"First, we calculate the distance Matteo traveled. He traveled at a speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For Matteo:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Shandy traveled. She traveled at a speed of 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles}
\]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, Shandy drove \(\boxed{230}\) miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875

"To determine how many gallons of water are remaining in the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day: \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day: \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped: \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank capacity: 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]
So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours. This means that after an additional 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]
So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 \approx C \times 0.531 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ C \times 0.531 = 0.28 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.531} \approx 0.528 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.528 \) or 52.8%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.8} \]"
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is $10,000. She wants to save 20% of this amount, so we calculate 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of peaches: \(3 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.50 \text{ each} = \$1.50\)
- The cost of pears: \(4 \text{ pears} \times \$0.50 \text{ each} = \$2.00\)
- The cost of kiwis: \(2 \text{ kiwis} \times \$1.00 \text{ each} = \$2.00\)
- The cost of apples: \(5 \text{ apples} \times \$0.75 \text{ each} = \$3.75\)

Now, let's sum these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
\[
\$1.50 + \$2.00 + \$2.00 + \$3.75 = \$9.25
\]

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits he has already bought, the remaining amount of money he has is:
\[
\$10.00 - \$9.25 = \$0.75
\]

Next, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Each plum costs $0.25. Therefore, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[
\frac{\$0.75}{\$0.25 \text{ per plum}} = 3 \text{ plums}
\]

Thus, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many packs Anne gave to her friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[
15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs}
\]

These 13 packs are given to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[
13 \text{ packs} \div 10 \text{ friends} = 1.3 \text{ pieces per friend}
\]

Thus, each friend received 1.3 pieces of sweets. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1.3}

"To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the compounded increase in price each year. The price increases by 5% annually, so each year the price is multiplied by \(1.05\).

Let's denote the initial price of carrots as \(P_0 = 120\).

After the first year, the price \(P_1\) is:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times 1.05 = 120 \times 1.05 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price \(P_2\) is:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 1.05 = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30 \]

After the third year, the price \(P_3\) is:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times 1.05 = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 138.165 \]

Rounding \(138.165\) to the nearest integer, we get \(138\).

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Albums**: She divided these pictures into 8 albums.
3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 albums were for selfies only.
   - 2 albums were for portraits only.
   - The remaining albums were for other categories.

First, calculate the number of albums that were not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Next, let's denote the number of selfies as \( S \) and the number of portraits as \( P \). According to the problem, the total number of pictures is the sum of selfies and portraits:
\[ S + P = 72 \]

Since the selfies and portraits are distributed among the albums, we can set up the following equations based on the distribution:
\[ S = 3 \text{ (since 3 albums are for selfies)} \]
\[ P = 2 \text{ (since 2 albums are for portraits)} \]

Now, we can verify if these values satisfy the total number of pictures:
\[ S + P = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

However, this does not match the total of 72 pictures. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the distribution. Since the problem states that the same number of pictures were put into each album, we need to find a consistent distribution.

Given that the total number of pictures is 72 and there are 8 albums, each album must contain:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Since 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits, the remaining 3 albums must be for other categories. Let's denote the number of pictures in the other albums as \( O \).

Thus, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ selfies albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]
\[ 2 \text{ portraits albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]
\[ 3 \text{ other albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ other pictures} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} + 27 \text{ other pictures} = 72 \text{ pictures} \]

This confirms our distribution is correct. Therefore, the number of selfies and portraits are:
\[ \text{Selfies} = 27 \]
\[ \text{Portraits} = 18 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27 \text{ selfies and } 18 \text{ portraits}}

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   After the early checkouts, the hotel has 76 guests.

3. **Guests who checked out late:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   After the late checkouts, the hotel has 61 guests.

4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
   After the afternoon check-ins, the hotel has 91 guests.

5. **Additional guests who checked in after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]
   After the additional check-ins, the hotel has 98 guests.

Thus, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"First, let's determine the number of bananas John picks each day.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum the number of bananas picked over the three days:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is:
\[
\boxed{22}

"First, let's determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions in the quiz.

The total number of questions is 60. 

- 40% of the questions are easy:
  \[
  0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ easy questions}
  \]

- The rest of the questions are equally divided into average and difficult questions. Therefore, the number of average and difficult questions combined is:
  \[
  60 - 24 = 36 \text{ questions}
  \]

- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided:
  \[
  \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ average questions}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ difficult questions}
  \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get correct.

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  0.75 \times 24 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ average questions correct}
  \]

- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ difficult questions correct}
  \]

Now, we sum up the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:
\[
18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36 \text{ questions correct}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold by Teresa as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is given as $4. Since each large stuffed animal is sold for three times the price of a small stuffed animal, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, the total revenue from the sales of small and large stuffed animals can be expressed as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the revenue equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we can now find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Adding these together:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Thus, the family eats \(\boxed{77}\) sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, we add the earnings from the cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Thus, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins. Since each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \]

Next, we know that out of the 100 eggs, 10 eggs were not found by the Smith twins. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends combined is:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Since the Smith twins found 60 eggs, the number of eggs found by their friends is:

\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of eggs found by the friends is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.

**Step 1: Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.**

We know:
- A dwarf with a bare hand mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
- A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines twice as much as a dwarf with a bare hand, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total ore mining rate for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.**

If one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes will mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

**Step 3: Find out how much ore they can mine in a month.**

Since there are 30 days in the month, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost of the sandwiches is directly proportional to the number of sandwiches in the package.

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for each package size:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches. We know that the cost per sandwich is $1.5, so for 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"First, let's determine the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. The number of red balloons that burst is:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, let's determine the number of yellow balloons that were released. Sally initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she accidentally released half of them. The number of yellow balloons released is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. The number of blue balloons she added is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:
\[ 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

Thus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 100% or 1.00
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 1.00 = 0.50\) or 50%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\) or 20%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.06\) or 6%

Now, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in the homework:
- Substitute teacher scenario: 50%
- Normal teacher with extension scenario: 20%
- Normal teacher without extension scenario: 6%

Total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in the homework:
\[ 50\% + 20\% + 6\% = 76\% \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 100\% - 76\% = 24\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not occupied by graduates or faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. After accounting for the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats available for distribution to graduates' friends and family is:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750 \]

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive if the 5750 seats are split equally among the 950 graduates. We do this by dividing the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{5750}{950} = 6.052631578947368 \]

Since the number of tickets must be a whole number, we round 6.052631578947368 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, each graduate will receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's determine her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find her net earnings after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it will take Richard to place the candy in each bottle.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is:
\[
\frac{24}{3} = 8
\]
So, Richard will place 8 bottles along the driveway.

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and place the candy, and he needs to do this 7 times (from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on, up to the seventh to the eighth), the total time is:
\[
7 \times 5 = 35 \text{ seconds}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.

\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars per pound} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.

\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} + \text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:

"First, let's determine the total amount of money Jim borrowed during his college years. He took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.

\[
\text{Total loan amount} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
\]

Next, we need to calculate the income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Before college, he had a $25,000 annual income. During his 4 years of college, he did not work, so he lost this income.

\[
\text{Income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
\]

After graduating, his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[
\text{New income} = 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college and the income he would earn after graduating. This includes his lost income and his new income.

\[
\text{Total income without college} = 100,000
\]
\[
\text{Total income after college} = 75,000
\]

The total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college is:

\[
\text{Total income without college} = 100,000
\]

The total income Jim would earn after graduating is:

\[
\text{Total income after college} = 75,000
\]

The difference between the total income after college and the total income without college is the amount he needs to earn to cover the loan amount:

\[
\text{Amount to earn} = 200,000 - 100,000 = 100,000
\]

Now, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn $100,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year.

\[
\text{Time to earn} = \frac{100,000}{75,000} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 1.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school.

\[
\boxed{1.33}

"To determine how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The dimensions of Jim's bed are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
\[ (6 + 2) \text{ feet} \times (8 + 2) \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total number of square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Letters on Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
Calculating the one-fifth part:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]
Adding 17 to this:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is:
\[ \text{Letters on Tuesday} = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
Calculating twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Adding 5 to this:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is:
\[ \text{Letters on Wednesday} = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total letters} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
Adding these together:
\[ 425 + 102 = 527 \]
\[ 527 + 209 = 736 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then sum these costs.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad: $6

\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we sum the costs of both salads to find the total amount Molly will pay:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 65 + 36 = 101
\]

Thus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is \(\boxed{101}\)."
"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race: $5
   - Twice the amount lost: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Therefore, Johnny's dad lost $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - 1.5 times the amount won: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   - Therefore, Johnny's dad lost $16.5 in the third race.

4. **Total Amount Lost:**
   - First race: $5
   - Second race: $11
   - Third race: $16.5
   - Total amount lost: \(5 + 11 + 16.5 = 32.5\)

5. **Average Amount Lost per Race:**
   - Number of races: 3
   - Average amount lost: \(\frac{32.5}{3} = 10.8333\ldots\)

Rounding to the nearest cent (if necessary), the average amount lost per race is approximately $10.83.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10.83}

"To determine the total population of South America, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of countries in South America:**
   There are 26 countries in South America.

2. **Determine the number of cities in each country:**
   Each country has 5 cities.

3. **Find the population of each city:**
   Each city has 1000 people living in it.

4. **Calculate the total population for one country:**
   Since each city has 1000 people and there are 5 cities in each country, the population of one country is:
   \[
   5 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 5000 \text{ people}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total population for all countries in South America:**
   There are 26 countries, and each country has 5000 people. Therefore, the total population of South America is:
   \[
   26 \text{ countries} \times 5000 \text{ people per country} = 130000 \text{ people}
   \]

Thus, the total population of South America is \(\boxed{130000}\)."
"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit. Let's use inches for this calculation.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Find the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks, we need to convert 3 weeks into days. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days. Therefore, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since each painter works \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day, the total number of hours worked by all painters is:
\[ 7.875 \times 4 \times \frac{3}{8} = 7.875 \times 1.5 = 11.8125 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we find the total number of hours worked by each painter. Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{11.8125}{4} = 2.953125 \text{ hours} \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ 2.95 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2.95} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means that each year the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = 20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 - 0.21) = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12422 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 - 0.21) = 12422 \times 0.79 = 9740.18 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in the year 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9740.18} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. We know that 10% of the 50 books are written in German. To find 10% of 50, we use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, we need to find the number of books written in Spanish. The total number of books is 50. We subtract the number of English books and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}

Next, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego, California and New York City, New York. The total distance is approximately 1955 kilometers.

So, we perform the subtraction:

\[ 1955 - 325 = 1630 \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive \(\boxed{1630}\) kilometers."
"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cups into gallons.

First, we know that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. So, the number of gallons she drinks is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's start with the initial number of people on the train, which is 120.

1. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

2. At the second stop, 50 people disembark and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

3. At the third stop, 80 more people disembark:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank Top**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \$10

"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile has a side length of 1 ft, so each tile covers an area of \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\) dollars."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the total annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's find the increased monthly cost. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. Since the cost is 60% more due to the accident, we need to calculate 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increased cost per month} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $72. Adding this to the normal monthly cost gives us the total monthly cost:

\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find the total annual cost. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Total annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays in a year is:

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of sheets Greg needs to wash each week:**
   - A twin bed requires 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - A king size bed requires 1 king set of sheets.
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed.
   - Therefore, the total number of twin sets of sheets is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
   - The total number of king sets of sheets is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
   - So, the total number of sheets Greg needs to wash each week is \(8 + 1 = 9\).

2. **Determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do each week:**
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
   - The laundry machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time.
   - Since Greg needs to wash 8 twin sets and 1 king set each week, he will need to do 4 loads of twin sheets (since \(8 \div 2 = 4\)) and 1 load of king sheets.
   - Therefore, Greg needs to do \(4 + 1 = 5\) loads of laundry each week.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(52 \times 5 = 260\).

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of movies they watch on a single Saturday:
\[ \text{Movies on Saturday} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the number of movies they watch on a single Sunday. According to the problem, they watch half the number of movies on Sunday as they do on Saturday:
\[ \text{Movies on Sunday} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we find the total number of movies they watch in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday):
\[ \text{Total movies per weekend} = \text{Movies on Saturday} + \text{Movies on Sunday} = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to find out how many weekends are in 4 weeks:
\[ \text{Number of weekends in 4 weeks} = 4 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks by multiplying the number of movies per weekend by the number of weekends:
\[ \text{Total movies in 4 weeks} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:

"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the following equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Silvia ate. The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

To find out how many slices they actually ate, we sum the slices each person ate:

\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 31 \]

2. **Cost of the visit**: $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the costs:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the cast} + \text{Cost of the visit} + \text{Cost of painkillers} + \text{Cost of parking}
\]

3. **Cost of painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
\]

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas left for the glee club:

\[
\text{Pizzas left for glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6
\]

Now, let's calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club:

\[
\text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. According to the problem, he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\]

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate some is:

\[
7 - 4 = 3
\]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[
3 + 3 = 6
\]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[
6 \times 4 = 24
\]

Thus, the final number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser. The number of trucks that successfully delivered is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase the butter, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of butter needed.
2. Determine the cost under the promotion.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of butter needed.**

Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.

\[
\text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the cost under the promotion.**

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis pays for 1 pound and gets the second pound at half price.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 2 pounds are in 6 pounds:

\[
\text{Number of sets of 2 pounds} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound at full price and gets the second pound at half price. The cost for each set is:

\[
\text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound at full price} + 0.5 \text{ pound at half price} = 1 \text{ pound} + 0.5 \text{ pounds} = 1.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since there are 3 sets:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds per set} = 4.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

The cost per pound of butter is $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4.5 pounds is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.5 \text{ pounds} \times 4 \text{ dollars per pound} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

\[
\boxed{18}

- Additional guests: \( 41 - 20 = 21 \)
- Cost for additional guests: \( 21 \times 6 = 126 \)

Now, we add the cost for the first 20 guests and the cost for the additional guests:

- Total cost: \( 125 + 126 = 251 \)

Thus, the total cost for the party is:

\[
\boxed{251}
\]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, we have:
\[ M = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \]

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so the amount she spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, so the amount she spent is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces of the first puzzle.

Teddy also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

In total, Teddy placed 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens of roses Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen but less than two dozens, we can calculate the cost as follows:
\[ 14 \text{ roses} = 1 \text{ dozen} \]
\[ 1 \text{ dozen} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 1 \text{ rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 15 \text{ roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 15 roses is $18.75. Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The change she should receive is:
\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters is:
\[ 6.25 \div 0.25 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with \(\boxed{25}\) quarters."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from the milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = 6 \times 5.50 = \$33.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the burger platters:
\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total revenue from the sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Now, we sum up the revenues from all the items to find the total amount of money Terry makes:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: \(10 + 20 = 30\) minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - Departure time: \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time.
   - Stay time: \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\) minutes.
   - Arrival time: \(60 + 5 = 65\) minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Departure time: \(65 + 60 = 125\) minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving.
   - Arrival time: \(125\) minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Departure time: \(125 + 20 = 145\) minutes.
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train.
   - Stay time: 20 minutes.
   - Arrival time: \(145 + 20 = 165\) minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 165 minutes after the first train scheduled to arrive at 10 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for:

\[ 165 - 10 = 155 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[
10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. 

\[
200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week.

\[
\frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
\[
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
\]
The discount percentage is calculated as:
\[
\text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the rate at which one spring creates jellyfish.
2. Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours.
3. Multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours by the number of springs.

Step 1: Determine the rate at which one spring creates jellyfish.
Since one spring creates one jellyfish per second, the rate of jellyfish creation per spring is 1 jellyfish per second.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours.
First, convert 4 hours into seconds:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]
Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
\[ 14400 \text{ jellyfish} \]

Step 3: Multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours by the number of springs.
If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
\[ 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish} \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{72000} \]"
"To find Frankie's score, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the equation based on the relationship between their scores.

1. Binkie's score is given as 90.
2. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Let's denote Binkie's score by \( B \) and Frankie's score by \( F \).

Given:
\[ B = 90 \]

The relationship between their scores is:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substitute Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

\[ F = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"First, let's determine the total distance James walked. The store is 4 miles away from his home, so he walked 4 miles to get halfway there, and then he had to walk back 4 miles to get home, and then he walked 4 miles again to get to the store. Therefore, the total distance he walked is:

\[ 4 \text{ miles (to halfway)} + 4 \text{ miles (back home)} + 4 \text{ miles (to the store)} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for James to walk this total distance. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by the formula:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the values for James' total distance and his walking speed:

\[ t = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches.

The cost of each bunch is $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually. This is the difference between the total cost if she bought individually and the total cost if she bought in bunches:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find its growth rate per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the growth over 13 years. Using the growth rate we found:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Number of Trekking bikes sold: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150\)
   - Number of BMX bikes sold: \(0.15 \times 300 = 45\)
   - Number of MTB bikes sold: \(300 - 150 - 45 = 105\)

2. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250\)
   - Price of one Trekking bike: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \(105 \times 500 = 52500\)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \(45 \times 250 = 11250\)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \(150 \times 450 = 67500\)

3. **Calculate the total earnings from all bikes:**

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net number of bales produced or removed each hour and then extend that to a 6-hour period.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \).

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \).

3. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales in the field:**
   - The net change is the number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up.
   - Net change = \( 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \).

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the field starts with 0 bales (assuming no bales were initially in the field), the number of bales left after 6 hours is the net change.
   - Number of bales left = \( 12 \text{ bales} \).

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the extra learning time each day is \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total extra learning time each week:**
   - John spends 100 minutes each day on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, the total extra learning time each week is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is \(1600 + 200 = 1800\) minutes.

7. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week in hours is \(\frac{1800}{60} = 30\) hours.

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for consistency.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child. Therefore, the second child is:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. Therefore, the third child is:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. Therefore, the fourth child is:

"First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling the apples."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of meat remained after the velociraptors.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is 270 kilograms. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area of the walls:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Choice:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 6 sodas (2 shaken and 4 unshaken).

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.
   - There are 2 shaken sodas out of 6 total sodas.
   - The probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100.
   - \(\frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\%\).

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{33.33\%}\)."

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works.
3. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.
4. Determine the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April 19th is included in the count.

Total days from March 1st to April 19th:
\[ 31 \text{ (March)} + 19 \text{ (April)} = 50 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off. Therefore, he works 80% of the days.

Number of days Billy works:
\[ 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works.**

Billy works 3 hours a day for 40 days.

"First, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses. Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses:

\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars. Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars:

\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

To find the total number of people who were inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:

"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"First, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide. The length of the biggest waterslide is 300 feet, and people slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute. The time taken to slide down the biggest waterslide is given by:

\[
\text{Time for biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length of biggest slide}}{\text{Speed of biggest slide}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide. The length of the second biggest waterslide is 240 feet, and people slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute. The time taken to slide down the second biggest waterslide is given by:

\[
\text{Time for second biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length of second biggest slide}}{\text{Speed of second biggest slide}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between sliding down the biggest slide and the second biggest slide:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time for biggest slide} - \text{Time for second biggest slide} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day.

- Lunch time per day: 30 minutes
- Break time per day: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day = Lunch time + Break time
Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days.

Total time over 5 days = 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Total time in hours = 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. We know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. So, we can set up the following equation to find the distance Ahito ran:

\[ \text{Distance Amber ran} + \text{Distance Micah ran} + \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 8 + 28 + \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 36 + \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 \]

To find the distance Ahito ran, we subtract 36 from 52:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - 36 = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial charge and the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Returned item: $15.00

After returning the item, the new balance is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the items she bought after the discounts:

1. Frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
   \[ 20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

2. Set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
   \[ 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Thus, the new balance on her credit card is:
\[ \boxed{113.00} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

\[
\boxed{90}

2. Ben is two times older than Chris. Therefore, Ben's age is:
   \[
   \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben. Therefore, Caroline's age is:
   \[
   \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Thus, Caroline is \(\boxed{24}\) years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lauren's annual savings.
2. Determine her annual living expenses.
3. Calculate the amount she needs to save for retirement.
4. Determine how many years she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Lauren's annual savings.**

Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000.
\[ \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine her annual living expenses.**

Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
\[ \text{Annual living expenses} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount she needs to save for retirement.**

Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. We need to find out how much she needs to save each year to cover her living expenses for 20 years.
\[ \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many years she needs to work to save the required amount.**

Lauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings.
\[ \text{Number of years needed to save} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \]

Since Lauren has already been working for some time, we need to find out how many more years she needs to work. Let's assume she has already worked for \( x \) years. The number of years she still needs to work is \( 40 - x \).

Since the problem does not specify how many years Lauren has already worked, we assume she has worked for 0 years (i.e., she is just starting her career). Therefore, she needs to work for 40 more years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Cut the ribbon into 4 equal parts:**
   Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts.
   \[
   \text{Length of each part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Divide each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts:**
   Each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long. We need to divide each of these 25 cm parts into 5 equal parts.
   \[
   \text{Length of each final part} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Thus, the length of each final cut is \(\boxed{5}\) cm."
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \). Since 40% of the students are boys, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls in the school, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

First, let's determine the total height of the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these two totals together to get the overall total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we need to find the average height of the heels. Since there are a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) heels, we divide the total height by the number of heels:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.
5. Find the difference between the required daily miles and the planned daily miles.

First, we know that Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

Next, we calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[
125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days:
\[
\frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
\]

Finally, we find the difference between the required daily miles and the planned daily miles:
\[
310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
\]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples each person wants to buy.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want to buy:
\[
\text{Total share of Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we subtract the total share of Pierre and Paul from the original 12 kg to find out how many kilograms James will have left:
\[
\text{James's share} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing 459 by the rate of 51 blinks per minute:

\[
\frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

Next, let's account for the additional fish Tate buys.

**Additional fish:**
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase.

**Total counts after purchase:**
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we find the total number of male and female fish.

**Total number of male fish:**
\[ 6 \text{ (male guppies)} + 5 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 11 \]

**Total number of female fish:**
\[ 8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16 \]

Finally, we determine how many more female fish there are than male fish.

\[ 16 \text{ (female fish)} - 11 \text{ (male fish)} = 5 \]

Thus, Tate has \(\boxed{5}\) more female fish than male fish."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took Amalia 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took Megan 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took Dior well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Dior took ""well over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume a time significantly greater than 4 hours. For simplicity, let's assume Dior took 10 hours (a reasonable assumption given the ""well over"" phrase).

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 10 hours

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

1. **Sofie's Walking Distance:**
   - Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

2. **Total Distance Sofie Will Walk in 7 Days:**
   - Since Sofie walks 10 miles each day, in 7 days she will walk:
     \[
     10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Brian's Walking Distance:**
   - According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, if Sofie walks 70 miles in 7 days, Brian will walk half of that distance:
     \[
     \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in seven days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order requirements.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 + 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 + 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since there are 5 workers, and they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's dog (one-fourth of Kory's dog)} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[
\text{Weight of Elijah's dog (half of Kory's dog)} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog:
\[

3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, before giving the stickers to Luis, Seth had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final numerical answer is 64."
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&M in ounces. John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces:

\[
3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces}

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie the albatross to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the Earth's circumference.
2. Determine how many days it takes Alfie to fly that distance.

First, we calculate half of the Earth's circumference:
\[
\text{Half of the Earth's circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

Next, we need to find the speed of the faster car. We know that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

\[
\text{Speed of the faster car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, the speed of the faster car is:

\[
\boxed{750}

"To determine Vince's current age, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

1. Liam's current age is 16 years.
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years.
3. Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let \(V\) be Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, \(14 = 2V\).

We can solve for \(V\) as follows:
\[
14 = 2V \implies V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]
So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
\[
7 + 2 = 9

Thus, Vince is currently \(\boxed{9}\) years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) (since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Now we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 2A + 9 + 21 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold. Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs. Therefore, the difference is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{200}{8} = 25
\]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each. Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box contains 8 crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, each box will weigh:

\[
8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces}
\]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons in the boxes is:

\[
25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we need to add the weight of the boxes themselves. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[
25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes together gives:

\[
200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces}
\]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[
\frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the tree that can be used for logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 80 planks at $1.2 per plank:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Valerie's brother's salary:**
   Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's salary is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:**
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine their mother's salary:**
   Their mother earns twice their combined salary. Therefore, her salary is:
   \[
   2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money they all have together:**
   \[
   5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of the walk and then sum these times.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write:
\[ v \times 40 = 2 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. So her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on both segments to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 per week for 8 weeks.

\[
4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[
60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[
\frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees:

- Three trees each had 7 blue birds: \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds.
- Two different trees each had 4 blue birds: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds.
- One tree had 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of blue birds:

\[
21 + 8 + 3 = 32
\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the remaining amount of water in the 33-degree mug is \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees.

He also pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the water he pours from the second mug as \( T - 1 \) degrees (assuming the temperature decreases by 1 degree for each ounce poured).

After pouring, the water in the water bottle has a temperature of \( \frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \) degrees, where 5 is the total amount of water poured into the bottle (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

Since the water in the water bottle is now at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following inequality:
\[ \frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Simplify the expression inside the fraction:
\[ \frac{28 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[ 28 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 172 \]

Therefore, the second bottle of water must be at least 172 degrees to allow Donny to drink it. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of cows:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Number of cows brought per day by Milkie Cows Limited: 20
- Number of days in three weeks: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

The total number of cows added over three weeks is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Adding the initial number of cows to the cows added:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens:
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Number of chickens brought per day by Broilers Limited: 10
- Number of days in three weeks: 21 days

The total number of chickens added over three weeks is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Adding the initial number of chickens to the chickens added:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and the total number of chickens:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[
\boxed{700}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00. The discount amount is:
\[ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the cost per bagel. Since Russell orders 4 packs and each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

The cost per bagel is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 1 less than 3:

\[
3 - 1 = 2
\]

So, 2 potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we multiply 18 by 2:

\[
18 \times 2 = 36
\]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.

Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans. Since there are 17 green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is:

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially and then find out how many women remain after 20 women alight at the next stop.

1. **Determine the total parts of the ratio:**
   The ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means the total number of parts is:
   \[
   5 + 9 = 14
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of men and women:**
   The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Since the ratio parts sum up to 14, each part represents:
   \[
   \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the number of men is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30
   \]
   And the number of women is:
   \[
   9 \times 6 = 54
   \]

3. **Determine the number of women remaining after some alight:**
   If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first find out how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply by 3.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[
\frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
\]
Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:
\[
7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales. Each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the sunflowers sold from the individual sunflowers:
\[
84 + 13 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day}
\]

To find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[
97 \times 3 = 291
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{291}

\]
\[
\text{Large-sized scenes per day} = 5
\]
\[
\text{Days for large-sized scenes} = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of days required to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
\[
\text{Medium-sized scenes} = 36
\]
\[
\text{Medium-sized scenes per day} = 6
\]
\[
\text{Days for medium-sized scenes} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days}
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of days required to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
\[
\text{Small-sized scenes} = 49
\]
\[
\text{Small-sized scenes per day} = 7
\]
\[
\text{Days for small-sized scenes} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \text{ days}

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's determine the total distance traveled:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in the first part.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in the second part.
- Therefore, the total distance traveled is:
  \[
  110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's determine the total time taken:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part.
- Sid then took 3 hours for the second part.
- Therefore, the total time taken is:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
  \]

Now, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
     \[
     3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability of both tickets being winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

"First, let's determine the height of Isabel's brother, Ned. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

According to the problem, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles required.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of one person, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
- For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Next, we determine how many more bottles are needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The number of additional bottles needed is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

Thus, the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce is \(\boxed{7300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in each color:
- Total number of babies: 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate how many of these babies wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (but since we can't have a fraction of a baby, we'll consider 1 baby for practical purposes)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the ratio of the number of purple-wearers wearing bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{66.67} \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

First, we calculate the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall total to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:

\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:

\[ \boxed{1125} \]"
"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham initially owns, which is 80 square meters.

1. **First Sale:**
   Abraham sold half of his land for $50.
   \[
   \text{Area sold} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from first sale} = \$50
   \]

2. **Second Sale:**
   After the first sale, Abraham has 40 square meters of land left. He then sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Area sold} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from second sale} = \$30
   \]

3. **Remaining Land:**
   After the second sale, Abraham has:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from remaining land} = 30 \times 3 = \$90
   \]

4. **Total Revenue:**
   Adding up all the revenues from the three sales:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$50 + \$30 + \$90 = \$170
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{170}
\]"
"To determine Geb's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of Haley's age.
2. Subtract 10 from that value to find Geb's age.

First, we know Haley's age is 26 years. So, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, he uses 2 face masks per outing.

2. **Determine the number of outings per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - Therefore, he uses \(3 \times 2 = 6\) face masks per day.

3. **Determine the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - If Tyrion uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days he will use \(2 \times 6 = 12\) face masks.

Thus, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we calculate:

\[
3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
\]

Next, we'll find out how many eggs each person found:

1. **Lamar finds 5 eggs.**
2. **Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:**
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. **Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy:**
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]
4. **Mei finds half as many as Charlie:**
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[
5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the original number of eggs to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard:

\[
36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
\]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex. Therefore, the total number of garbage collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2350}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Since Sophia gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her $100, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 that Sophia gave him, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jack has now is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's denote the amount of money given to Ronnie as \( R \) and the amount given to Rissa as \( S \). According to the problem, Ronnie was given $5, so \( R = 5 \). Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so \( S = 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

2. **Determine the distribution of paint colors:**
   - Red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts.
   - Yellow paint makes up half of the mural.

3. **Set up the variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount of red paint in pints.
   Since red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts, the amount of white paint is also \( x \) pints, and the amount of purple paint is also \( x \) pints.

4. **Express the amount of yellow paint:**
   Since yellow paint makes up half of the mural, the amount of yellow paint is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for the total amount of paint:**
   The total amount of paint is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
   \[
   x + x + x + 6 = 12
   \]

6. **Simplify and solve for \( x \):**
   Combine the terms:
   \[
   3x + 6 = 12
   \]
   Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   3x = 6
   \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\) pints."
"First, we need to calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the area of the living room. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we can find the total area of the house by adding the area of the bedrooms, the area of the living room, and the area of the rest of the house. The area of the rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from the previous day.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ puffs}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from the previous day.
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ puffs}
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from the previous day.
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ puffs}
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   The number of puffs doubles from the previous day.
   \[
   24 \times 2 = 48 \text{ puffs}
   \]

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day to find the total for the week:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box contains 100 pods.

To find 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

Adding this to the 100 pods in the regular box:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box contains 120 pods and costs $12. We need to find out how many cycles of 1 pod each can be run with $1.

Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of cycles that can be run with $1 is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{1 \text{ pod}} = 1 \text{ cycle} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the scoring for both teams in the first and second halves.

### First Half Scoring
- **Team A**: Scores 4 goals.
- **Team B**: Scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. Therefore, Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

### Second Half Scoring
- **Team B**: Scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Therefore, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
- **Team A**: Scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Therefore, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

### Total Goals Scored
- **Team A**: Goals in the first half + Goals in the second half = \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals.
- **Team B**: Goals in the first half + Goals in the second half = \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals.

### Total Goals in the Match
- Total goals scored by both teams = Goals scored by Team A + Goals scored by Team B = \(6 + 10 = 16\).

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the piece of chalk, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of chalk used on Monday:**
   - The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday.
   - The total chalk used is 45% of 5 inches.
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The initial chalk was 5 inches.
   - After using 2.25 inches, the remaining chalk is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily usage when the teacher uses only 20% of the chalk:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - The daily usage is:
   \[
   0.20 \times \text{remaining chalk}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of days until the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is less than 2 inches.
   - We need to find the number of days \( n \) such that the remaining chalk is less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( R_n \). The remaining chalk after each day can be calculated as:
\[
R_{n+1} = R_n - 0.20 \times R_n = 0.80 \times R_n
\]

We start with \( R_0 = 2.75 \) inches and need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( R_n < 2 \) inches.

We can set up the inequality:
\[
2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
(0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75}
\]
\[
(0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273
\]

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
\[
\ln((0.80)^n) < \ln(0.7273)
\]
\[
n \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.7273)
\]

Since \(\ln(0.80)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.80)\) and reverse the inequality:
\[
n > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.80)}
\]

Calculating the logarithms:
\[
\ln(0.7273) \approx -0.310
\]
\[
\ln(0.80) \approx -0.223
\]

Thus:
\[
n > \frac{-0.310}{-0.223} \approx 1.39
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys who are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys who are not on varsity.

The number of girls not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity}
\]

The number of boys not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity}

1. Calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

2. Add 2 to the result to find out how many face masks Johnny bought:
   \[
   15 + 2 = 17

"First, let's determine the number of teeth the dentist fixes. According to the problem, the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

So, the total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus realized that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the milk had passed the expiry date. Therefore, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Since the company refunded the cost of the returned milk, we need to calculate the refund amount. The cost per gallon is $3.5, so the refund amount is:

\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in the refund is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

First, for the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

Second, for the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation. From the first equation, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Now substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Next, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( C = 20 \).

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5(C + 7) \):
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) \]
\[ W = 5 \times 27 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

Now, check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).
Wendy's current age is 135, so in 25 years, Wendy will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \).

Check if Colin's age in 25 years is a third of Wendy's current age:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed \( \boxed{20} \)."
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books in total. We know that he spends $27,000 in total.

Next, we need to find out how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100
\]

First, we calculate the number of books he can buy with $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Then, we multiply by 100 to find the total number of books he can buy with $27,000:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Bob can buy 5400 books with $27,000. Since he is distributing this money among 3 schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Thus, Bob can buy \(\boxed{1800}\) books per school."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples**: Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First Apple**: One apple landed on Newton's head.
   - Apples on the ground: 1

3. **Newton's Actions**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples (1 on his head and 1 on the ground).
   - He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - This action caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 5

4. **Second Set of Apples**:
   - Newton picked up the 5 apples that fell out.
   - He put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - This action caused 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 6

5. **Final Set of Apples**:
   - Newton picked up all 6 apples that fell out.
   - He put all of them in his pocket.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton brought home:
- Apples in his pocket: 1 (from the first set) + 1 (thrown into the tree) + 1 (from the second set) + 6 (from the final set) = 9 apples

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of the coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[
\boxed{306}

"First, we need to determine the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 6 cheese pizza slices:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese pizza slices} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each of the 6 friends eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni pizza slices} \]

Now, we need to find out how many whole cheese pizzas are required. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and she needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

First, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on the days he ran 3 miles:
- Monday: 3 miles
- Wednesday: 3 miles
- Friday: 3 miles

Adding these together:
\[ 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on the days he ran 5 miles:
- Tuesday: 5 miles
- Thursday: 5 miles

Adding these together:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to find the total miles run in the week:
\[ 9 + 10 = 19 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's find out how many snowballs Jay builds in a given time period. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs he adds to his collection every 15 minutes.

In 15 minutes, Jay builds:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ snowballs}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ snowballs} \]

However, 2 snowballs melt in that same period, so the net number of snowballs he adds is:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ snowballs per 15 minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to get to 60 snowballs. If he adds 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, then the number of 15-minute intervals needed to get 60 snowballs is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{3 \text{ snowballs per 15 minutes}} = 20 \text{ intervals} \]

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:
\[ 20 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it will take before Jay has 60 snowballs is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is currently 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice.

Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Now, we sum the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

\[
1 \text{ (Doxa)} + 2 \text{ (sister)} + 3 \text{ (brother)} = 6 \text{ slices}
\]

Thus, the total number of slices they all ate is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Total bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\).

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - Total bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\).

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - Total bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\).

We are given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 97 - x = 78 \]
where \(x\) is the number of bandages they used on the third day. Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 97 - 78 = 19 \]

Since they used 25 bandages on the third day, and the equation shows they used 19 bandages, it indicates that the bandages used on the third day are consistent with the bulk packs ordered and used.

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was initially 10 inches long and ended at 8 inches. The length of hair cut is:

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Jen works in a week:

\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April. Since there are 4 weeks in April:

\[ 45 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Jen's earnings from her hourly rate of $1.5 per hour:

\[ 180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jen has complete attendance for the month of April, she receives an additional $10:

\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Jen will receive is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period, he earns:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, he earns:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information given, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[
\text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of blood in ten sharks. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, the total amount of blood in ten sharks is:

\[
\text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Entry:**
   - In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Initial entry} = 50
   \]

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Entry at 10:00} = 40
   \]

3. **Entry After 10:00:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in after that time.
   \[
   \text{Entry after 10:00} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Entry by Evening:**
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Entry by evening} = 3 \times 50 = 150
   \]

Now, we sum up all the entries to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:
\[
\text{Total number of people} = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
50 + 40 = 90
\]
\[
90 + 80 = 170
\]
\[
170 + 150 = 320

"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of black pens were bought. According to the problem, Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Therefore, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we can find the total number of pens Alain has by adding the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac. The total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after accounting for the fish with red stripes. This is:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Finally, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has:

- Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors. So, the total number of colors from the palettes is:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8
  \]

- Amy has three makeup sets, each with six colors. So, the total number of colors from the makeup sets is:
  \[
  3 \times 6 = 18
  \]

- Adding the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has is:
  \[
  8 + 18 = 26
  \]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes. This reduces the total number of eyeshadow colors by the number of colors in one palette:
\[
4
\]

So, the number of eyeshadow colors left after the palette is stolen is:
\[
26 - 4 = 22
\]

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

So, the number of eyeshadow colors left after using up half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[
22 - 3 = 19
\]

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"First, let's determine Mattison's height in inches:
\[ \text{Mattison's height} = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the height of the first floor of the house. According to the problem, the first floor is three times Mattison's height:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the second floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

"To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Determine the number of shells remaining after team Alphas.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:
\[
0.40 \times 700 = 280
\]
So, team Alphas found 280 shells. This means the number of shells remaining after team Alphas is:
\[
700 - 280 = 420
\]
Next, we calculate the number of shells found by team The finders. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
\[
0.60 \times 420 = 252
\]
So, team The finders found 252 shells. This means the number of shells found by team Gogetters is the remaining shells after both teams Alphas and The finders have found their shells:
\[

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles walked by all four dogs. Finally, we can determine the miles walked by the last dog.

1. Calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
   - First dog: 1 mile
   - Second dog: 4 miles
   - Third dog: 3 miles

   Total miles for the first three dogs:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Given that the average miles walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles, we can find the total miles walked by all four dogs:
   \[
   \text{Total miles for all four dogs} = 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find the miles walked by the last dog, subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
   \[
   \text{Miles walked by the last dog} = 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}

"First, we need to determine the amount of the loan John gets. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts:

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:

\[
\text{Amount leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Thus, the final amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:

\[
\boxed{40000}

"To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas.
2. Determine the total cost of the tunas.
3. Calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the tunas. Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"First, let's determine the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
\]

So, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Thus, Trinity's profit is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each speed per day:

- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: 2 times the low setting = 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day
- High setting: 2 times the medium setting = 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed over the specified periods:

1. **Low setting for 3 days:**
   \[
   1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Medium setting for 3 days:**
   \[
   2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **High setting for 5 days:**
   \[
   4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}
   \]

Finally, we sum the amounts of water removed over all the periods:
\[
3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is:
\[
\boxed{29}

"First, we need to determine the total number of water balloons Jolene and her friends initially had. They filled 10 packs, with each pack containing 30 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons is calculated as follows:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons}
\]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[
300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons}
\]

Thus, the number of balloons thrown is:

\[
\boxed{288}
\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi had to combine with the first medicine for one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount:

\[
3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of the first and second medicines:

\[
14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[
56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL}
\]

Thus, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:

\[
\boxed{448}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the problem, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we add the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes to find the combined capacity of both schools:
\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"First, let's determine the total amount Stephen will owe his sister. Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. The interest amount is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6
\]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[
300 + 6 = 306
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over the 11 months. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months:

\[
\text{Total payment over 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month. The total amount Stephen owes is $306, and he has already paid $275 over the first 11 months. Therefore, the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month is:

\[
306 - 275 = 31
\]

Thus, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Jordan has 2 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is:
     \[
     5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day}
     \]

2. Determine how many diaper changes Jordan's wife changes.
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan's wife changes is:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day}
     \]

3. Calculate the number of diaper changes Jordan changes.
   - Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diaper changes per day, the remaining diaper changes are changed by Jordan.
   - Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan changes is:
     \[
     10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day}
     \]

Thus, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{side length}^2 \times \text{height} = 6^2 \times 15 = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the effective volume:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Determine the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 2880 = 864
   \]

5. **Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

2. **Number of people who entered the bus at the first stop:**
   40 people entered the bus at the first stop.
   \[
   \text{Total number of people on the bus after the first stop} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Number of people who entered the bus at the second stop:**
   At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus.
   \[
   \text{Number of people who entered at the second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of people on the bus after the second stop} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]

4. **Number of people on the bus after the third stop:**
   At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled.

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the initial cost per visit:**
   The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Calculate the cost per visit after 5 years:**
   The cost increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of the initial cost and add it to the initial cost.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3
   \]
   \[
   \text{New cost per visit} = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years:**
   Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year for 5 years.
   \[
   \text{Total visits in 5 years} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for the first 5 years} = 15 \times 2 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years:**
   Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years.
   \[
   \text{Total visits in the next 3 years} = 3 \times 3 = 9

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of students who will try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required based on the number of groups and the time each group takes.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), so the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the 30 students. We do this by dividing 30 by 8:
\[ 30 \div 8 = 3 \text{ groups with a remainder of } 6 \]
This means we can form 3 full groups of 8 students each, and there will be 6 students left over. The 6 students will form one additional group. Therefore, we have 4 groups in total.

Since each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

"Let the length of the shorter piece be \( x \) feet. Then the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \) feet.

The length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional charges:

\[
35 + 40 = 75
\]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if both services are purchased together. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[
0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price for both services:

\[
75 - 15 = 60

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. Therefore, the number of paintings Shelley has can be expressed as:
\[ S = K + 8 \]

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, the number of paintings Samantha has can be expressed as:
\[ 27 = S - 12 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 27 = (K + 8) - 12 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 27 = K + 8 - 12 \]
\[ 27 = K - 4 \]

To find \( K \), add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 27 + 4 = K \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Thus, Kim has \(\boxed{31}\) paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

The original price of the toy in November is $40.

An 80% increase means the price increases by \( 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \) dollars.

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

A 50% decrease means the price decreases by \( 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \) dollars.

So, the price in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of money Charlie makes from the standard lessons. He has 4 lessons at a standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[
4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per hour} = 4 \times 80 = \$320
\]

Next, let's calculate the amount of money he makes from the lessons given to veterans. He has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 25% off the standard rate. The reduced rate is:

\[
80 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \text{ per hour}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total for the 2 veteran lessons:

\[
2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per hour} = 2 \times 60 = \$120
\]

Finally, we add the amounts from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day:

   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them. We calculate the number of apples he ate as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving 9 to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[

"To determine the number of novels Regina has written this year, we start by understanding the relationship given in the problem. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels is 3 quarters of \( x \). We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[
9 = \frac{3}{4} x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
\]

Thus, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since his average speed is 50 km/hr, we need to know the total time he travels. However, the problem does not specify the total time, so we assume he travels continuously for 3 days without any breaks. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels for \(3 \times 24 = 72\) hours.

The total distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 72 \, \text{hr} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage 3600 km is of the total distance between Alaska and Texas, which is 6000 km. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

"First, let's determine the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used in total by Madeline and her brother. Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother gives:

\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Let \( x \) be the total number of grapes at the beginning. The grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother together should equal the total number of grapes at the beginning. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x = 36 + 48 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 84 \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

\[
\boxed{84}

"First, we need to determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, which is 82.

Next, we know that 13 of these teachers were sick, so the number of teachers who were not sick is:
\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Additionally, 9 substitute teachers were called in to help. These substitute teachers are also present at the school.

To find the total number of teachers at school that day, we add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

Thus, the total number of teachers at school that day is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the cheese ingredients per week:

- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

So, the total cost of cheese per week is:
\[ 3.00 + 6.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week, including the cost of the pasta. The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and we assume Bud uses one box of pasta each time he makes the macaroni and cheese.

Thus, the total weekly cost is:
\[ 1.00 + 9.00 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[ \boxed{520.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has only 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have enough time. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms. Since the total time required is 20 hours and they work 8 hours per day, the fraction of the day spent cleaning is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we convert this fraction to a percentage:

\[ 2.5 \times 100\% = 250\% \]

However, since the custodian only works 8 hours per day, the effective percentage of the day spent cleaning is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \times 100\% = 250\% \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 3.125 \times 100\% = 312.5\% \]

Thus, the percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{312.5\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

\[
10 \text{ (middle shelf 1)} + 10 \text{ (middle shelf 2)} + 20 \text{ (bottom shelf)} + 15 \text{ (top shelf)} = 55 \text{ books}
\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books per bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases}
\]

Thus, the number of bookcases Elly needs is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
\frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red hats:**
   Skyler has 100 hats in total, and half of them are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   After removing the red hats, the number of remaining hats is:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**
   Three-fifths of the remaining 50 hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (\text{Number of red hats} + \text{Number of blue hats}) = 100 - (50 + 30) = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the original price of the beef jerky bag and the discounted price.

The original price of the bag is $18.00.

Since the store is offering a $3.00 discount, the price of the bag during the promotion is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. The bag contains 30 sticks.

To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price of the bag by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00 \text{ dollars}}{30 \text{ sticks}} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Since we need the final answer in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the cost per stick of jerky is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct. We calculate the number of correct answers on the first test as follows:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. To find out how many questions she needs to get correct on the second test, we first need to determine the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass both tests combined. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly to pass, and the total number of questions across both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

We need her to answer 70% of 110 questions correctly:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

This means Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly in total. Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is given by:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Thus, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 3 marbles plus the 5 he didn't lose, making a total of 3 + 5 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, he needs 8 customers to ensure he meets or exceeds his goal.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

"First, let's determine the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room. Since there are 8 rooms, the number of additional flashlights is:

\[ 2 \text{ flashlights/room} \times 8 \text{ rooms} = 16 \text{ flashlights} \]

Adding the flashlights for the people and the flashlights for the rooms, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ flashlights} + 16 \text{ flashlights} = 20 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, let's determine the number of candles. There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of these rooms (4 rooms) have small candles, while the other half (4 rooms) have medium candles. Each small candle provides enough light for half a room, and each medium candle provides enough light for a full room. Therefore, the number of small candles needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ small candles/room} = 8 \text{ small candles} \]

The number of medium candles needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 1 \text{ medium candle/room} = 4 \text{ medium candles} \]

Adding the small and medium candles together, we get:

\[ 8 \text{ small candles} + 4 \text{ medium candles} = 12 \text{ candles} \]

Finally, the total number of candles and flashlights used is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. The total distance is 200 yards, with half of the distance being on land and the other half in water. Therefore, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. The speed on land is 20 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{hop}} \) for the hop is given by:
\[
t_{\text{hop}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}

- Alicia has 5 blouses.
- The cost per blouse is $5.00.
- Therefore, the cost for the blouses in one week is:
  \[
  5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pants:
- Alicia has 2 pairs of pants.
- The cost per pair of pants is $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost for the pants in one week is:
  \[
  2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair} = \$16.00
  \]

Then, let's calculate the cost for the skirt:
- Alicia has 1 skirt.
- The cost per skirt is $6.00.
- Therefore, the cost for the skirt in one week is:
  \[
  1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00

"First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed:

\[
2.5 \times 150 = 375 \text{ WPM}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words:

\[
10 \text{ pages} \times 450 \text{ words/page} = 4500 \text{ words}
\]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes can be calculated using the formula:

\[
t = \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{words per minute}} = \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}}

   The number of people on the third day was twice the number on the second day.
   \[
   \text{Number of people on the third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140
   \]

4. **Average for the Remaining Days:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Total Number of People for the Remaining Days:**
   Since there are 3 days left and the average is 60 people per day:
   \[
   \text{Total number of people for the remaining days} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

6. **Total Number of People for the Week:**
   Adding the number of people from all days:
   \[
   \text{Total number of people} = 50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440
   \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[
\boxed{440}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of popcorn kernels that pop.

1. **Initial 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 20 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = 60.

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the rate from the previous 30 seconds.
   - Rate from previous 30 seconds = 60 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = 240.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate halves the rate from the previous 30 seconds.
   - Rate from previous 30 seconds = 240 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = 120.

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat.
   - Number of kernels that pop due to residual heat = \( \frac{120}{4} = 30 \).

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

- Initial 30 seconds: 20 kernels.
- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels.
- Next 30 seconds: 240 kernels.
- Final 30 seconds: 120 kernels.
- Residual heat: 30 kernels.

Total number of kernels that pop:
\[ 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = 470 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{470} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemon juice Tim needs. He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. Therefore, he needs:

\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \]

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, he will need:

\[ 1 \text{ cup} \]

So, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 5 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 5 cups is:

\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's calculate the daily dog food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Next, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption of dog food:
\[15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg}\]

Now, we need to find the total weekly consumption. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
\[21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 147 \text{ kg/week}\]

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:
\[

"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
   \[
   10 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ legs/animal} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   \[
   15 \text{ animals} \times 4 \text{ legs/animal} = 60 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   \[
   20 \text{ legs} + 60 \text{ legs} = 80 \text{ legs}
   \]

4. Convert the total number of legs into pairs of legs by dividing by 2:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ legs}}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs}

"First, let's determine the number of yellow blocks. We know that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, let's denote the number of red blocks by \( r \). The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks. According to the problem, the total number of blocks is 32. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + r = 32 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 12 + r = 32 \]

To find \( r \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ r = 32 - 12 \]
\[ r = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west.

He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. The distance he traveled west is:
\[
\text{Distance west} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east.

He drove east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph. The distance he traveled east is:
\[
\text{Distance east} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we need to determine the net distance from Elvis's starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
\[
\text{Net distance} = \text{Distance east} - \text{Distance west} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, Elvis is \(\boxed{54}\) miles from his house now."
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **Initial Value:**
   The initial value of the boat is $9000.

2. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the new value of $6300.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the new value of $4410.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 0.20 \times 4410 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of orange and yellow candies.

Given:
- Number of red candies = 54
- Number of orange candies = 2 * number of red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Number of yellow candies = 1/2 * number of red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Next, we calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Thus, the number of pink candies is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. According to the problem, one night at the hotel costs $80.

Next, we need to determine the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[
0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[
3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars}
\]

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[
7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips:
\[
240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Initially, Dallas has 21 marbles. After dropping 4 marbles, the number of marbles Dallas has is:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

This means that the total number of marbles Dallas and Darla have together is 21. Since Mazie originally had 52 marbles and she gave all of them to Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is 52. Therefore, the number of marbles Darla has is:

\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \]

Since Dallas has 17 marbles, the number of marbles Darla has is:

\[ 31 \]

To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles Darla has:

\[ 31 - 17 = 14 \]

So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed the pigs eat per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed the pigs eat in a week.
3. Subtract the total amount of feed eaten in a week from the initial amount of feed ordered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed the pigs eat per day.**

Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. Therefore, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

For 5 pigs, the total feed consumption per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ pigs} \times 8 \text{ pounds/pig/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of feed the pigs eat in a week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total feed consumption in a week is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total amount of feed eaten in a week from the initial amount of feed ordered.**

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pens George has} = 3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. The problem states that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
\]

Thus, the number of pens Sarah has is:

\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:

\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, Jackie's height before the summer was:

\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in one week.
3. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

**Step 1: Number of bars produced in one day**
The company produces 5000 bars per day.

**Step 2: Number of bars produced in one week**
There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the number of bars produced in one week is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35000 \text{ bars/week} \]

**Step 3: Number of bars produced in two weeks**
The number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 35000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

**Step 4: Total revenue from selling the bars**
The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at 50% off.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt at 50% off is \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \).

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. A 40% discount means Jake pays 60% of the original price.

The discounted price of the shoes is \( 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \).

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

The total amount is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, he earns:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones at $1.25 each:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the total amount of money Ryan has:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan now wants to buy movie tickets, which cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \text{ dollars} \div 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Since Ryan can only buy whole tickets, the number of movie tickets he can buy is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

- Pair of sunglasses: $30
- Two bathrobes: $100 each, so 2 * $100 = $200

Total amount Lani spent = $30 + $200 = $230

Now, let's find the total amount they both spent together:

Total amount spent by Ellen and Lani = $105 + $230 = $335

The final numerical answer is 335."
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

1. **Cost of passion fruit for one jar:**
   - Each jar requires 2 pounds of passion fruit.
   - The cost of passion fruit is $6 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of passion fruit} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of jackfruit for one jar:**
   - Each jar requires 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.
   - The cost of jackfruit is $8 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of jackfruit} = 1.5 \text{ pounds} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of honey for one jar:**
   - Each jar requires 2 pounds of honey.
   - The cost of honey is $10 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of honey} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum the costs of all the ingredients to find the total cost for one jar:
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = 12 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. To find the profit per jar, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit per jar} = 50 \text{ dollars} - 44 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find the total profit for selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
\[
\text{Total profit for 10 jars} = 6 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for:

\[ 7 \text{ days/week} - 2 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ days/week} \]

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, we calculate his earnings over 2 weeks:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes each day. Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day, but Nate fills in 9 holes per day. The net change in the number of holes per day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

This means that each day, the number of holes increases by 3. We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes. Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes. The total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is:

\[ 3d = 84 \]

Solving for \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{84}{3} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. We know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School.

Given:
- Norman High School's average enrollment = 4000 students

To find Butler High School's average enrollment:
\[
\text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
\]

Calculate the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3 \times 1000 = 3000
\]

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students.

Next, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School's enrollment} - \text{Butler High School's enrollment}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

1. **Test Tubes:**
   Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes. Igor gathered half as many as requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of test tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Petri Dishes:**
   Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes. Igor gathered two more than the number requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of Petri dishes gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Beakers:**
   Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers. Igor picked up the correct number of beakers.
   \[
   \text{Number of beakers gathered} = 7
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of items gathered by Igor:
\[
\text{Total items gathered} = \text{Number of test tubes} + \text{Number of beakers} + \text{Number of Petri dishes}
\]
\[
\text{Total items gathered} = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31
\]

According to the problem, the total number of items placed on the lab bench was 29. Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised.

\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. If Aaron ran 4 miles, then Vanessa ran:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. The time it took Aaron to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time for Aaron} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{A \text{ miles per minute}} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

From this, we can solve for \( A \):

\[ \frac{4}{A} = 16 \]
\[ A = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since \( A = 2V \), we can find \( V \):

\[ \frac{1}{4} = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{1}{4} \div 2 = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 8 miles. The time it took Vanessa to run 8 miles is:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{V \text{ miles per minute}} = \frac{8}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much new line is required for the existing 200 feet of dock. According to the problem, the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Therefore, for 200 feet of dock, the required line is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we need to account for the 6 feet of new line that the caretaker already has. To find out how much more line he needs to buy, we subtract the 6 feet of existing line from the total required line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of existing line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Thus, the total number of feet of line the caretaker needs to buy is:

\[
\boxed{594}

\[
\$10 + \$5 = \$15
\]

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations per night. Therefore, the total cost per night is:
\[
6 \times \$15 = \$90
\]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week. Thus, the total cost for the week is:
\[
2 \times \$90 = \$180

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[
\text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
\]

Next, we add the profit to the original cost price to find the total selling price:
\[
\text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
\]

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon. Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons for $100, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[
\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
\]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for:

"First, let's determine the current age of James. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, Dora's current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]
Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine John's current age. We know that John had a son James when he was 19, and James is currently 18. Therefore, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the age of John's youngest son is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]
In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Ana spends 3 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
\]

Next, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Jane spends 4 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour. This is the difference between the number of oranges Ana can peel and the number of oranges Jane can peel:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The installation cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the installation cost:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + k = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each. So, we can write the equation for the total number of legs:
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
