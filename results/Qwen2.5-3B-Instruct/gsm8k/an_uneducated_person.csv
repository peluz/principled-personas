"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. Janet uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.
4. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

To find out how many eggs are sold, we subtract the eggs used for breakfast and the eggs used for muffins from the total eggs laid:

\[ \text{Eggs sold} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs eaten for breakfast} - \text{Eggs used for muffins} \]

\[ \text{Eggs sold} = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Now, Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. So, the total amount she makes every day is:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Eggs sold} \times \text{Price per egg} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs and the increase in value.

Josh initially bought the house for $80,000 and then added $50,000 in repairs. So the total cost before the increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increased by 150%. To find out how much the value increased, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is the original cost plus the increase:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Now, to find out the profit, we subtract the original cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

He runs 3 times a week, so in a week, he runs:

\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

The final numerical answer is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

1. In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed.
2. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.

So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total feed needed for the entire flock is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups per chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The amount of feed needed for the final meal is the total feed needed for the day minus the feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Price of the first glass:** $5
2. **Price of the second glass:** 60% of $5 = 0.60 * $5 = $3
3. **Price of the third glass:** $5
4. **Price of the fourth glass:** 60% of $5 = $3
5. **Price of the fifth glass:** $5
6. **Price of the sixth glass:** 60% of $5 = $3

We can see that every second glass costs $3, and the rest cost $5. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:

- There are 8 pairs of glasses (since every second glass is $3).
- Each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.
- So, 8 pairs cost 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we add the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it would take \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes to download 80 GB.

2. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it would take \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes to download 120 GB.

3. **Add the time for the restart and the time to download the remaining part:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.
   - The total time is \( 40 \) minutes (for 40% of the file) + \( 20 \) minutes (restart) + \( 60 \) minutes (for the remaining 60% of the file) = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to break down John's journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at 80 mph.
   - Total time for the fourth segment = 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments to find the total distance John has traveled:
- Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Eliza worked 45 hours this week. The first 40 hours are at her regular rate of $10 per hour. The remaining 5 hours are overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, let's add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the first month's downloads.
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ downloads}
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \text{ downloads}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads}
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \text{ downloads}
   \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}

   6 \times 55 = 330
   \]
   So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $330.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the pastries to find the total cost:
\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

So, the total cost is $694."
"To figure out how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to compare the cost of planting the tree and the yearly expenses with the money he makes from selling lemons.

First, let's calculate the yearly earnings from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.

So, the yearly earnings from lemons are:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, let's calculate the yearly expenses:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the total earnings to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

The initial cost to plant the tree is $90. We need to find the number of years \( y \) such that the total earnings equal the initial cost:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total expenses} \]
\[ \$10.5 \times y = \$90 \]

To find \( y \), we solve the equation:
\[ y = \frac{\$90}{\$10.5} \]
\[ y = \frac{90}{10.5} \]
\[ y = \frac{900}{105} \]
\[ y = \frac{180}{21} \]
\[ y = \frac{60}{7} \]
\[ y \approx 8.57 \]

Since Carlos can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take 9 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, she has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. Then she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. This means she has \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
6. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
7. Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
8. Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
9. Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is:

\( 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) students.

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves:

\( 20 - 4 = 16 \) students remaining.

Next, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. So:

\( 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \) students.

This means 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. Now, the rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students.

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\( \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \).

So, the final numerical answer is 60%."
"To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the option that gives the highest increase in value.

First, let's calculate the increase in value for the jewelry:
- Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
- Increase in jewelry market: 2.5%
- Increase in value of jewelry: $5,000 * 0.025 = $125
- New value of jewelry: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Next, let's calculate the increase in value for the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Increase in electronic gadgets market: 1.2%
- Increase in value of electronic gadgets: $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
- New value of electronic gadgets: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, let's compare the new values:
- New value of jewelry: $5,125
- New value of electronic gadgets: $8,096

The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets because they will have a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from choosing the electronic gadgets would be:
- Profit = New value of electronic gadgets - Initial value of electronic gadgets
- Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

So, the final numerical answer is:
96"
"To solve this problem, we need to add up the distances each train traveled in both directions.

First, the trains traveled westward for 80 miles each day. So, for the westward travel:
\[ 80 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 160 \text{ miles} \]

Next, the trains traveled northward for 150 miles each day. So, for the northward travel:
\[ 150 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances traveled in both directions to find the total distance covered by each train:
\[ 160 \text{ miles} + 300 \text{ miles} = 460 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to find out how much she earns from each job and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Now, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ \$35,000/\text{year} + \$22,500/\text{year} = \$57,500/\text{year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \$57,500 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day:**
   - Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.

2. **Calculate how many eggs she uses in one week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in one week, she uses \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \).

3. **Calculate how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:**
   - In 4 weeks, she uses \( 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - So, \( 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking:
- She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
- She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
So, the total time spent hiking so far is:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail. To find the total time she needs to spend hiking to achieve this average speed, we use the formula for average speed:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]
Given that the average speed is 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, we can solve for the total time:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking, so the remaining time she needs to spend hiking is:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we need to find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles (since the total distance is 12 miles and she has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles):
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Let's confirm this with a final answer in a separate line:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate the amount of water as follows:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate the amount of water as follows:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks before any spillage:
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After pouring, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so the total volume of the mixture is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining mixture is the same as the total water we calculated earlier because the volume of the pineapple drink remains unchanged. Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \text{Water in remaining mixture} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

To express this as a numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{\frac{47}{3}} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid $19.50 which is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

So, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.75 \times P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75

- Five packs of milk at $3 each cost \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Four apples at $1.50 each cost \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:

- So, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- The total cost for the shorts is $49.50.
- The total cost for the pants is $67.50.
- The total cost for the shoes is $126.
- So, the total amount Mishka spent is \(49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of servings Cynthia eats in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night.
   - There are 60 days in the period.
   - Therefore, she eats \( 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \).

2. **Calculate the number of cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the two pairs of high heels cost together. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. So, the second pair of heels costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[33 + 66 = 99\] dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \(B\) dollars, then:
\[B = 99 + 5 = 104\] dollars.

So, the cost of the boots is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age, and then find out Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. **Understand the ratio and total age:**
   - The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
   - The sum of their ages is 162.

2. **Set up the variables:**
   - Let Darrell's age be \(7x\).
   - Let Allen's age be \(11x\).

3. **Formulate the equation based on the total age:**
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]

4. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9

"To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and then divide by the number of guesses.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guesses 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding that to 80 gives us 100. So, the third friend guesses 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
80 + 60 + 100 = 240

There are 3 guesses in total, so we divide the total by 3 to find the average:
240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of. John has 10 dogs.

So, for 10 dogs, it would be:
0.5 hours/dog/day * 10 dogs = 5 hours a day.

To find out how many hours a week he spends, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week:
5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.

The final numerical answer is 35 hours."
"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Gretchen has \( S \) silver coins.
2. According to the problem, she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so she has \( S + 30 \) gold coins.
3. The total number of coins is 110. So, the sum of silver coins and gold coins is 110.
4. We can write this as an equation: \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: \( 2S + 30 = 110 \).
6. Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2S = 80 \).
7. Divide both sides by 2: \( S = 40 \).
8. So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.
9. Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has \( 40 + 30 = 70 \) gold coins.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

Next, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points.

25% of 4 points is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the points from both parts of the game to find the total points:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total number of points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]

"First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we multiply 2 by 30:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to get 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing 60 by 4:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/pack = 15 packs

Each pack costs $5.00, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find out how much Terry spends:

15 packs * $5.00/pack = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells all his lego sets for $15 each and he has 13 lego sets. So the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He uses this $195 to buy 8 video games for $20 each. The total cost for 8 video games is:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So the total amount of money he spent on video games and the lego sets is:

$195 (from selling lego sets) - $5 (leftover) = $190

The amount spent on video games is $160, so the amount spent on the lego sets is:

$190 (total spent) - $160 (spent on video games) = $30

Since he sold all 13 lego sets for $15 each, and he spent $30 on them, it means he sold 2 lego sets for $15 each and had 11 lego sets left. So the final number of lego sets he still has is:

13 lego sets - 2 lego sets = 11 lego sets

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to know the total distance he runs and the total time he spends running. Let's break it down:

1. **Total distance John runs in a week:** 60 miles.

2. **Time spent running each day:**
   - First day: 3 hours.
   - Second day: Half as much as the first day, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.
   - Third day: Half as much as the first day, so 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

3. **Total time spent running in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours.
   - Second day: 1.5 hours.
   - Third day: 1.5 hours.
   - Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

4. **Speed calculation:**
   - Speed = Total distance / Total time.
   - Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can find her running speed by doubling the skipping speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. The total time is 6 hours, and she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now we can calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther.

\[
\text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. Therefore, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

\[
\text{Distance outside reach} = \text{Distance with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

"Grandma Jones cut each of the 5 apple pies into 8 pieces, so she had a total of 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26 pieces."
"First, let's find out how many calories are left for the day. If your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you can still eat:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. According to the nutritional info, one serving of chips has 250 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings are in a 300g bag of chips. The problem states that a 300g bag has 5 servings.

To find out how many grams are in one serving, we divide the total weight of the bag by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams per serving} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since one serving of chips is 60 grams and contains 250 calories, we need to find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories. We can do this by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ grams}}{250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60 \text{ grams} \times 200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{12000}{250} \]

\[ x = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of making 20 candles:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - Therefore, to make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax.
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax is $10.00.
   - So, the cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 * 2 = $20.00.
   - The cost of wicks for 20 candles is also $10.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for making 20 candles is $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

2. **Determine the revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - So, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is $2.00 * 20 = $40.00.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = $40.00 - $30.00 = $10.00.

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is $10.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of articles written on each day:**
   - On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday.
   - On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   - Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
   - Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about.
   - Total hours = Total articles \(\times\) Hours per article
   - Total hours = 26 \(\times\) 4 = 104 hours

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."

So, the number of post-it notes she purchased is the total used minus the ones she had left, which is 220 - 57 = 163 post-it notes.

The final numerical answer is 163."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
2. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
3. Blue ties cost $40 each.
4. John spent $200 on blue ties.

From the information, we can calculate the number of blue ties John bought:

- If each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200, then the number of blue ties he bought is:
  \[
  \frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
  \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
- The number of red ties he bought is:
  \[
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
  \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties:
- The cost of each red tie is:
  \[
  40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:
- The total cost for 10 red ties is:
  \[
  10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

4. **Occupied fraction**: 3/4 of the building is occupied
5. **Occupied units**: 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units
6. **Unoccupied units**: Total units - Occupied units = 120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's figure out how many eggs Lloyd sells per day. Since he sells them for $2 per dozen and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he sells 2 eggs per day.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs he sells in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so he sells 2 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 14 eggs/week.

Now, we need to find out how much he makes from selling 14 eggs per week. Since he sells 2 eggs for $2, we can find out how much he makes from 14 eggs by calculating the cost for 7 dozens (since 14 eggs is half a dozen, and he sells a dozen for $2).

So, for 14 eggs, he makes $2 (since 14 eggs is half a dozen).

Therefore, Lloyd makes $2 per week from selling eggs."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM at 10 miles per hour. This means he travels for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).
2. We need to find out how long it takes him to travel back at 6 miles per hour.

First, we need to know the distance he traveled to the destination. Since he travels at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, he needs to travel back 30 miles at 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes him 5 hours to get back. Let's write the final numerical answer in a separate line.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times 0.25 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove to find out how much weight is left to be removed from the toys.

\[ \text{Weight left to be removed from toys} = 15 \text{ pounds} - 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Weight left to be removed from toys} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy.

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5 \text{ pounds}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ pound per toy}} \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 7.5 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. We know the following:

1. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
2. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
3. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

First, we need to find out how much weight the boxes can add to the truck without exceeding the bridge's limit. We do this by subtracting the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's limit:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

This means the boxes can add up to 1245 pounds to the truck. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we need to determine how many boxes can be added without exceeding 1245 pounds:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83. We can verify this by calculating the total weight:

\[ 3755 + 83 \times 15 = 3755 + 1245 = 5000 \text{ pounds} \]

This total weight is exactly the bridge's limit, so the maximum number of boxes is indeed 83.

1. Marcy gets a pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
2. After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension at that point is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.
3. So, starting from year 21, she gets 5% of $1,000,000 per year, which is $50,000 per year.

Now, if Marcy quits after 30 years, she will have received the full $50,000 pension for the first 20 years and 5% of the pension for the next 10 years.

So, her annual pension for the first 20 years is $50,000.
For the next 10 years, her pension is $50,000 * 5% = $2,500.

Adding these together, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

The final numerical answer is:
52500"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the monthly subscription cost:**
   The streaming service charges $140 per month.

2. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in a half-year.
   - The cost for each month is $140.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times \$140 \text{ per month} = \$840
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The cost for the second half of the year is 10% less than the monthly cost.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } \$140 = 0.10 \times \$140 = \$14
     \]
   - Subtract this 10% from the original monthly cost:
     \[
     \$140 - \$14 = \$126
     \]
   - The cost for each month in the second half of the year is $126.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times \$126 \text{ per month} = \$756
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     \$840 + \$756 = \$1596
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{1596}
\]"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she used for the 100 miles she traveled. She put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank, so the amount of gas used for 100 miles is 4 gallons.

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive with the full tank of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas and she used 4 gallons for 100 miles, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) she gets from her car:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

With a full tank of 12 gallons, the total distance she can drive is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ miles per gallon} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does it.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he spends \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours on TV and reading.

Now, to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\( 9 \times 4 = 36 \) hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 36 hours."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each school has sent a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has 5 players. So, for each school, there are 5 players for the girls' team and 5 players for the boys' team. That's a total of 5 + 5 = 10 players per school.

2. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. So, each school has 1 coach for the girls' team and 1 coach for the boys' team. That's a total of 1 + 1 = 2 coaches per school.

3. Therefore, for each school, there are 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people in total.

4. Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 4 schools * 12 people per school = 48 people.

So, the final numerical answer is 48."
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 * 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's find out how many boys are at the school. If there are twice as many boys as girls and there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

So, there are 120 boys and 60 girls, making a total of:

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \text{ students} \]

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So, the number of teachers is:

\[ 36 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ 36 \]"
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to calculate the total amount she received from her weekly allowance and then subtract that from the total amount she has at the end.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the $40 she received from her allowance. Let's denote the amount of money she started with as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week:**
   - Judy teaches 5 classes every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - So, the number of classes on weekdays = 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.

2. **Add the classes she teaches on Saturday:**
   - Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
   - So, the total number of classes in a week = 25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes.

3. **Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:**
   - Each class has 15 students.
   - So, the total number of students = 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:**
   - Judy charges $15.00 per student.
   - So, the total amount of money = 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

The final numerical answer is $7,425.00."
"The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

"To calculate how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each type of dessert sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- So, the total money from brownies is \(43 \times 3 = 129\).

For the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each cheesecake slice is sold for $4.
- So, the total money from cheesecakes is \(23 \times 4 = 92\).

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes:
- Total money raised is \(129 + 92 = 221\).

So, Tommy raises $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Next, we need to calculate the interest on the total cost. The interest rate is 2% per unit:

Interest per unit = 2% of $150 = 0.02 * $150 = $3

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest is:

Total interest = 5 * $3 = $15

Now, we add the total interest to the original cost to get the total amount Shiela will pay:

Total amount = Original cost + Total interest = $750 + $15 = $765

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so we divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month:

Monthly payment = Total amount / 3 = $765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of each level of Luke's sandcastle, we need to first determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet.
2. Level 3: Half of Level 4 = 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.
3. Level 2: Half of Level 3 = 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.
4. Level 1: Half of Level 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will use in the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life in the first year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days.
- So, the total amount of dog food used in the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days:
- A year has 365 days.
- So, the number of days left in the first year is:
  \[
  365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days:
- The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food every day for the remaining 185 days.
- So, the total amount of dog food used in the remaining 185 days is:
  \[
  2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}
  \]

Finally, we add the dog food used in the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}

"First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

From the information that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can calculate how much David does:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the better price per flower for Vincent and then calculate how much he saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

First, let's calculate the cost per flower for each option:

1. **Packages of 3 for $2.50:**
   - Cost per flower: \( \frac{2.50}{3} \approx 0.8333 \) dollars per flower.

2. **Packages of 2 for $1:**
   - Cost per flower: \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars per flower.

The better price per flower is $0.50, which comes from buying packages of 2.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the better price:

- Cost for 18 flowers at $0.50 per flower: \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9.00 \) dollars.

Now, we need to determine the cost if Vincent buys the flowers at the worse price (packages of 3):

- Cost for 18 flowers at $2.50 per 3 flowers:
  - Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
  - Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the savings by buying 18 flowers at the better price:

- Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \) dollars.

So, Vincent saves **6.00 dollars** by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To solve this, first we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 30% of $100.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost.

\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the final cost of grooming the dog is $70."
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we know the boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the two girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The original amount of water was 24 liters. So, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for both the adults and the children.

First, let's determine how much potato salad one child will eat:
- An adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- A child eats half as much as an adult, so a child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.

Next, we calculate the total potato salad needed for the adults:
- There are 20 adults.
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- Therefore, the total potato salad for adults is \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

Now, we calculate the total potato salad needed for the children:
- There are 5 children.
- Each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad.
- Therefore, the total potato salad for children is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

Finally, we add the total potato salad needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount Ted needs to bring:
- Total potato salad = potato salad for adults + potato salad for children
- Total potato salad = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

So, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

The final numerical answer is:

James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we calculate:
\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"First, let's understand the problem step by step.

1. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
2. When she cooks the canned tomatoes, they lose half their volume. This means that the 32 ounces of sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes she used before cooking.
3. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes before cooking was 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
4. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
5. To find out how many 16 ounce cans of tomatoes she used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
6. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit, so the number of cars left is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
3. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
5. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars exited, the number of cars left after the first 15 minutes is \( 25 - (x + 20) = 5 \). This simplifies to:
\[ 25 - x - 20 = 5 \]
\[ 5 - x = 5 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 0.

The final numerical answer is:
0"
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary receives 18 new potted plants from her nursery:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 58 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 58 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we need to add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

So, the total number of doorbell rings is \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\).

The final numerical answer is 175."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city. We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

The final numerical answer is:
140"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000 pieces.

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: 
   - Poppy places a quarter of the pieces.
   - A quarter of 1000 pieces is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{1000}{4} = 250 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**:
   - After placing 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
     \[
     1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
     \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**:
   - Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.
   - A third of 750 pieces is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{750}{3} = 250 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - So, Poppy's mom places 250 pieces.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom**:
   - After placing 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the TV watching time for each day:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours watched from Monday to Friday:

1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) + 0.5 hour (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours watched and the hours we've accounted for is:

7 hours (total) - 6 hours (accounted) = 1 hour

This 1 hour of TV watching must be the 30 minutes (0.5 hour) he watched on Wednesday. Therefore, Frankie watched 0.5 hours of TV on Wednesday, which is equivalent to 1 episode of a 30-minute show.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry meant to bake \( x \) cookies this year.
2. He actually baked twice as many as he meant to, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He dropped 5 cookies, so he actually had \( 2x - 5 \) cookies left.
4. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x - 5 = 110
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x - 5 = 110 \\
   2x = 115 \\
   x = 57.5
   \]
6. Since \( x \) represents the number of cookies Henry meant to bake this year, and he meant to bake twice as many as last year, the number of cookies he baked last year is \( x / 2 \):
   \[
   \text{Cookies baked last year} = \frac{57.5}{2} = 28.75
   \]

Since the number of cookies must be a whole number, and the problem setup suggests a realistic scenario, we can conclude that Henry meant to bake 57.5 cookies this year, which implies he baked 28.75 cookies last year. However, in a practical scenario, we would round to the nearest whole number, but the problem doesn't specify rounding, so we'll keep the exact value.

The final numerical answer is:
28.75"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without any cashback:

1 gallon costs $3.00
So, 10 gallons cost $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons:

Cashback is $0.20 per gallon
So, for 10 gallons, the cashback is $0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Now, subtract the total cashback from the total cost:

Total cost without cashback: $30.00
Total cashback: $2.00

So, the final cost after cashback is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final numerical answer is $28.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate = 2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups.

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's fruit roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Total number of roll-ups Marcell ate = 3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups.

Now, we need to find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate:
- Total number of roll-ups eaten by both = 48 roll-ups (Beatrice) + 42 roll-ups (Marcell) = 90 roll-ups.
- Number of people = 2.
- Average number of roll-ups eaten = Total number of roll-ups / Number of people = 90 roll-ups / 2 people = 45 roll-ups.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of Julia's rowing:**
   - Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
   - To find her speed in feet per second, we divide the distance by the time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - Using the speed we calculated, we can find the total distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the rate at which the boat takes on water:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - To find the rate in liters per foot, we divide the amount of water by the distance:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - The total distance to the shore is 80 feet.
   - Using the rate of water intake, we can find the total amount of water:
     \[
     \text{Total water} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Distance} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the information step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - According to the problem, \( 1800 = 6B \).
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( N \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the lumber:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board is sold at the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board is sold at the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

Now, let's add up the total revenue from all the lumber:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Since the total parts add up to 20, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar correspond to one part by dividing the total number of teaspoons by the total number of parts:

\[ \text{Teaspoons per part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the ratio of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts, the number of teaspoons of sugar she used is:

\[ \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42. Let's confirm this with a final answer.

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
   - Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary four years ago can be expressed as \( L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     1.3L = 40000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she slept each day to find the total for the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

"First, let's calculate how far Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After 3 hours, Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The total time is 7 hours, so the remaining time is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate how far she can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts of her run to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. So, she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.
3. After stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

This means that the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is the total number of stamped letters minus the number of letters she stamped herself. So, the number of letters already stamped when Jennie began is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia originally had some number of spoons, but we don't know how many.
2. She bought a new package of spoons.
3. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons.
4. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
5. After all this, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally had as \( x \). After buying the new package and getting 5 more from her husband, she had \( x + \text{(number of spoons in the package)} + 5 \) spoons. After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \text{(number of spoons in the package)} + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + \text{(number of spoons in the package)} + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x + \text{(number of spoons in the package)} = 10 \]

Since we don't know \( x \), we can't determine it directly, but we know that the number of spoons in the package plus 2 equals 10. So the number of spoons in the package is:

\[ \text{(number of spoons in the package)} = 10 - x \]

But we don't need to know \( x \) to find the number of spoons in the package. We can see that the number of spoons in the package plus 2 equals 10, so the number of spoons in the package is:

\[ \text{(number of spoons in the package)} = 10 - 2 = 8 \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of a Pepper**: Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon**: A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an Orange**: An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[

   \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **880 dollars**."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, each patient is seen for \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours the hospital sees patients in a day is \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients.
   - So, the total revenue from the patients is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - So, the total cost to the hospital is \( 150 \times 200 = 30000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**

3. We know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.
4. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total.

So, the calculation for Wednesday's miles is:
\[ \text{Wednesday's miles} = \text{Total miles} - (\text{Monday's miles} + \text{Tuesday's miles}) \]
\[ \text{Wednesday's miles} = 41 - (4 + 24) \]
\[ \text{Wednesday's miles} = 41 - 28 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

Now, we know the total number of bees is 700. So we can write the equation:

\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:

\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, the number of queens is 100. Now we can find the number of worker bees:

\[ \text{Number of worker bees} = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400. Let's write the final answer in a separate line.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Bicycles:** Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so for 10 tires, it would cost 10 * 25 cents = 250 cents. Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, 250 cents = 2.5 dollars.

2. **Tricycles:** Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires. For 9 tires, it would cost 9 * 25 cents = 225 cents. Converting to dollars, 225 cents = 2.25 dollars.

3. **Unicycle:** A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came with a unicycle, that's 1 tire * 25 cents = 25 cents. Converting to dollars, 25 cents = 0.25 dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money she made:
- From bicycles: 2.5 dollars
- From tricycles: 2.25 dollars
- From unicycle: 0.25 dollars

Total money made = 2.5 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5 dollars.

"To calculate the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours he spends each day and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- So, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- So, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from the three days and the two days to get the total hours per week:
- Total hours per week = hours on Monday, Wednesday, Friday + hours on Tuesday, Thursday
- Total hours per week = 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
- Total hours in one semester = total hours per week \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total hours in one semester = 17 \(\times\) 16 = 272 hours.

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls = 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches.

2. **Chocolate croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches.

Next, we sum up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- Total length = 1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches.

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
- Total length in feet = 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."

"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs 100 yards to the end and 100 yards back, so that's 200 yards per run. Since he does this 15 times, the total distance he runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each way, so that's 160 yards per run. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she runs is:
\[ 34 \times 160 = 5440 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances run by Blake and Kelly. Kelly runs 5440 yards and Blake runs 3000 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 5440 - 3000 = 2440 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Kelly) runs 2440 yards farther than the loser (Blake). The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2440 \]"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item he bought and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens:
- He bought 4 pens.
- Each pen costs $1.5.
- So, the total cost for the pens is \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- He bought 2 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $4.
- So, the total cost for the notebooks is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

Then, let's consider the cost of the rim of bond paper:
- He bought 1 rim of bond paper.
- The rim of bond paper costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the rim of bond paper is $20.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Cost of pens: $6
- Cost of notebooks: $8
- Cost of rim of bond paper: $20

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \]

So, Raphael spent a total of $34.

The final numerical answer is:
34"
"Finn originally saw 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more came out, so that's an increase to 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 hid, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Monday's Water Depth**: The tank has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.
2. **Tuesday's Water Depth**: On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. So, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. **Wednesday's Water Depth**: On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate how many starfish, sea horses, and clownfish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Total starfish caught:
- Anakin: 10
- Locsin: 5
- Total: \(10 + 5 = 15\) starfish

Total sea horses caught:
- Anakin: 6
- Locsin: 3
- Total: \(6 + 3 = 9\) sea horses

Total clownfish caught:
- Anakin: 3
- Locsin: 5
- Total: \(3 + 5 = 8\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: 15
- Total sea horses: 9
- Total clownfish: 8
- Total fish: \(15 + 9 + 8 = 32\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that every two months, the price becomes 120% of its previous value.

3. **Number of Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, in 36 months, there will be 36 / 2 = 18 price increases.

4. **Calculating the Price After Each Increase**: Each time the price increases, it is multiplied by 1.20 (which is 120% or 1 + 20%).

5. **Final Calculation**: We need to find the price after 18 increases. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]
   Plugging in the initial price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

7. **Final Price**:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

So, the final price of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of one red car is $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. An action figure costs $5.

First, we need to find out how much the doll costs. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much one red car costs, which is given as $4.

Now, we need to find out how much 3 action figures cost. Since each action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

The doll costs $15, and the red car costs $4. We also know there are 3 action figures, each costing $5.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} + \text{Cost of the red car} + \text{Cost of 3 action figures} \]
\[ 15 + 4 + 15 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ 34 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the missed income Jackie would lose if she does her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring an accountant.

First, let's determine how much missed income Jackie would lose if she does her taxes herself. She would be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. So, the missed income is calculated as follows:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to compare this missed income to the cost of hiring an accountant. The accountant charges $90. Since the missed income is $105 and the cost of hiring the accountant is $90, Jackie would lose more money by doing her taxes herself. The difference in cost is:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's add up the cost of all the items Elvira bought:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:

€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 15 * 3 = 45 eggs.

Since she gets 9 eggs every time she babysits, she needs to babysit 45 / 9 = 5 times.

The final answer is 5."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[
(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
\]
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's current age (\( B = 8 \)), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is 16 years old. Let's confirm this by checking the conditions of the problem:
- In 2 years, Seth will be \( 16 + 2 = 18 \) years old.
- In 2 years, Brooke will be \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) years old.
- The sum of their ages in 2 years will be \( 18 + 10 = 28 \), which matches the problem statement.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Pancho walks 20 miles a day for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day.

So, the total miles he walks in a week is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} + 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} \]
\[ = 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} \]
\[ = 120 \text{ miles} \]

The final numerical answer is 120 miles."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it's \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of one uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature Jake sees and then add them together.

For the spiders:
80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs

For the insects:
90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, we add them all together:
640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (invertebrates) = 1210 legs

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"Okay, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we add up the ages of the four birds:
Sally Two: 19 years
Granny Red: 16 years
Sally Four: 8 years
Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years

"First, let's calculate the minimum payments for each of Jessica's debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Next, we calculate 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt:

- Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month
- Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month
- Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Now, we add up the payments for all debts to find the total monthly payment:

- Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

- Total yearly payment: $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is $18000."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Billy spends on peeling and cutting the potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling the potatoes:
- Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- He has 60 potatoes to peel.
- So, the total time for peeling is \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting the potatoes:
- Billy takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- He has 60 potatoes to cut.
- So, the total time for cutting is \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the total cutting time into minutes to add it to the peeling time:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute.

Let's do the calculations:
- Time for peeling: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes.
- Time for cutting: \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) seconds.
- Convert 300 seconds to minutes: \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes.

Finally, add the peeling time and the cutting time:
- Total time: \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost for lemons is $3 and the cost for sugar is $2. So, the total cost for one gallon is:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much they make from selling one gallon of lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue from selling one gallon is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit from selling one gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know that their total profit is $25. To find out how many gallons they sold to make $25 in profit, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon:
\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the cost of lemons for one gallon is $3, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people is:

240 Asians - 80 Japanese = 160 Chinese

We are told that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

160 Chinese - 60 boys = 100 girls

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and the remaining amount after those expenses.

Zaid's salary is 6000$ per month.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 6000$ = \( \frac{6000}{4} = 1500 \) $
2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 6000$ = \( \frac{6000}{3} = 2000 \) $

Total spent on rent and car fuel:
\( 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \) $

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\( 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \) $

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\( \frac{1}{2} \) of 2500$ = \( \frac{2500}{2} = 1250 \) $

Remaining amount after donation:
\( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \) $

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
Total given to daughter and wife:
\( 200 + 700 = 900 \) $

Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife:
\( 1250 - 900 = 350 \) $

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is 350$.

\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we add up the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 40 + 36 = 76 \]
\[ 76 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

- So, his earnings for the first week = 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 an hour.
- So, his earnings for the second week = 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many votes the loser got. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Total Votes Cast**: The total number of students who voted is 80.

2. **Votes for the Winner**: The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes.
   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
   \]

3. **Calculate Votes for the Winner**:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, the winner got 60 votes.

4. **Votes for the Loser**: The total votes are 80, and the winner got 60 votes. Therefore, the loser must have the remaining votes.
   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is \( 4W \).

3. Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   200 = 5W
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

4. Now, we can find the number of red roses. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations:
   \[
   4W = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]
   So, Sandra needs 160 red roses.

Therefore, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \(\boxed{160}\)."

1. We know Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28.
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14. Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old two years ago.
4. Since two years ago Mark was 19, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.
5. Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.

The final numerical answer is 23."
"First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team to complete the race. Each member of the faster team runs their leg in 55 seconds, and there are four members.

\[
\text{Total time for faster team} = 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team to complete the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third).

\[
\text{Total time for slower team} = 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds}
\]

Adding these times together:

\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}

Now, we find the difference in time between the faster team and the slower team:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]
To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Hamsters' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits' Straw Distribution:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Straw Distributed to Rats:**
   - Total straw distributed to all small rodents = 160 pieces.
   - Straw distributed to hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw distributed to rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw distributed to rats = 160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Number of Rats:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Number of Rats in Each Cage:**
   - There are 3 cages for rats.
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the interest and then add it to the original amount Mandy owes.

1. **Original amount owed:** $100
2. **Monthly interest rate:** 2% or 0.02 (as a decimal)
3. **Number of months:** 3

First, calculate the total interest over 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest} = \text{Original amount} \times \text{Monthly interest rate} \times \text{Number of months} \]
\[ \text{Total interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total interest} = 100 \times 0.06 \]
\[ \text{Total interest} = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the original amount to find out how much Mandy should give Benedict:
\[ \text{Total amount to give} = \text{Original amount} + \text{Total interest} \]
\[ \text{Total amount to give} = 100 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total amount to give} = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**."

   - If the trader sold \( y \) bags, the total revenue is \( 30y \) dollars.

5. **Profit calculation:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, \( 30y - 22x = 400 \).

6. **Selling price and profit relationship:**
   - We know the trader sold all the bags, so \( y = x \).
   - Substituting \( y = x \) into the profit equation:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8}
     \]
     \[
     x = 50
     \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food to find the total cost of these items:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = \$20.25 + \$15.75 = \$36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total cost of tickets and food to find the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = \$36.00 + \$66.00 = \$102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\$102.00}{3} = \$34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

If he can collect 2 peaches a minute, then in 180 minutes he collects 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.

So, the final numerical answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we first need to know how much they need in total per day and then divide that by the number of ducks.

The total amount of insects needed per week is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how much they need per day by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7.

\[ \text{Insects needed per day} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Insects needed per day} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, since there are ten ducks in the flock, we need to find out how much each duck needs per day. We do this by dividing the daily amount by the number of ducks.

\[ \text{Insects needed per day per duck} = \frac{0.5 \text{ pounds}}{10 \text{ ducks}} \]

\[ \text{Insects needed per day per duck} = 0.05 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each duck needs 0.05 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees every year.

3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees every year.

4. **Net increase in trees each year**: 
   - Trees planted: 10
   - Trees chopped down: 2
   - Net increase: \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

5. **Number of years**: We are considering 10 years.

6. **Total increase in trees over 10 years**:
   - Net increase per year: 8 trees
   - Over 10 years: \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

7. **Total number of trees after 10 years before any die**:
   - Initial trees: 50
   - Increase over 10 years: 80
   - Total: \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

8. **Trees that die after 10 years**:
   - 30% of the trees die.
   - Number of trees that die: \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

9. **Number of trees left after 10 years**:
   - Total trees after 10 years: 130
   - Trees that die: 39
   - Trees left: \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is 91."

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Friday morning after the prank:**
   - \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

4. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors put back the newly painted white flamingos:**
   - So, the number of white flamingos became 6.

5. **On Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink flamingos:**
   - So, the total number of pink flamingos became \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

6. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - The number of white flamingos remained 6.

7. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the amount distributed from the total amount of carrots available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds."
"To find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher each week. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Next, we need to find out how much Publisher A pays Mark per sentence. According to the problem, Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents per sentence.

Now, we calculate how much Publisher A pays Mark for 500 sentences:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate how much Publisher B pays Mark for 500 sentences:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the payments from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:
\[ 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

So, the total number of liters of water Baldur gets every day is 55 liters."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Weekly Salary**: John makes $2000 a week.

2. **5% Raise in Salary**: 
   - 5% of $2000 is calculated as \( 0.05 \times 2000 = 100 \).
   - So, his new weekly salary after the raise is \( 2000 + 100 = 2100 \) dollars per week.

3. **Yearly Salary Calculation**:
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his yearly salary without the award is \( 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \) dollars.

4. **Award Money**:
   - The award gives him an additional $5000.

5. **Total Yearly Salary**:
   - Adding the award money to his yearly salary, we get \( 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \) dollars.

   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese used for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices, so each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**

"To solve this, we need to find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440

2. We know that Mr. Bert will remove the lowest score from the average. The lowest score among the first five is 71. So, we remove 71 from the sum:
   440 - 71 = 369

3. Now, we need to find out what the total sum of all six test scores should be to have an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
   Total sum of scores / Number of tests = Average
   So, 369 + x (where x is the score on the sixth test) / 6 = 93

4. We can rearrange this to solve for x:
   369 + x = 93 * 6
   369 + x = 558
   x = 558 - 369
   x = 189

So, Brinley needs to score 189 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, so the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cups are in twenty dozen. Since one dozen equals 12 cups, twenty dozen cups would be:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

The cost of twenty dozen cups is $34800, so the cost of each cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes.

The jacket costs $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes together:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, Sara needs $70 to buy the jacket and shoes.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the remaining money after her babysitting earnings.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the additional money she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn. Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so:
\[ 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens.
2. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens.
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens produce \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.
5. The total number of eggs collected each day is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens, which is \( 3r + 5(r + 2) \).
6. We know that the total number of eggs collected each day is 42. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   \]
7. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r + 10 = 42
   \]
8. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   8r = 32
   \]
9. Divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   r = 4
   \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. Let's confirm this by calculating the total number of eggs:
- Red chickens: \( 4 \) chickens, \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) eggs.
- White chickens: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) chickens, \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) eggs.
- Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \).

The calculation confirms that the answer is correct. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the total distance he walks around the park. The park is a rectangle, so the distance around it (the perimeter) can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to add the number of customers from the first and second days to the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
100 (first day) + 150 (second day) + (total by third day - 100 - 150) = 500

Let's calculate it step by step:
100 + 150 = 250
500 - 250 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

The final numerical answer is:
250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons.
2. Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, and the big pool is leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons 4 minutes ago.
3. In 4 minutes, the big pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons due to the leak. So, the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.
4. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so \( 2S - 16 = 4S \).

We can solve the equation \( 2S - 16 = 4S \) to find \( S \):

\[
2S - 16 = 4S
\]

Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:

\[
-16 = 2S
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = -8
\]

Since the amount of water can't be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The equation \( 2S - 16 = 4S \) should be:

\[
2S - 16 = 4S
\]

Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:

\[
-16 = 2S
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 8
\]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's confirm this by checking the big pool's current water level:

If the small pool has 8 gallons, then 4 minutes ago it had \( 8 \) gallons, and the big pool had \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) gallons. In 4 minutes, the big pool lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons, so the big pool now has \( 16 - 16 = 0 \) gallons. This means the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, which is \( 0 = 4 \times 8 \), which is correct.

So, the final answer is:

8"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus 10% of that amount.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ 220 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 220 \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. So, we multiply Harriet's age by 3.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Find the average age of the three in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3.
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

So, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 more, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, the points scored by Jojo can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"

\(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

The total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.

The tank originally had 120 liters of water. After using 90 liters, the remaining water is:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Next, Celine collected rainwater that is twice the amount of the water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the remaining water in the tank:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The number of days for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Days:**
   - Andrew will travel by bus to Rochester and then by car back to New Jersey.
   - The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the days for each leg of the trip.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Count of Cards:**
   - Fire type: 30
   - Grass type: 20
   - Water type: 40

2. **Changes in the Count:**
   - James loses 8 water type cards.
   - James buys 14 grass type cards.

3. **New Count of Cards:**
   - Fire type remains 30.
   - Grass type increases by 14, so it becomes 20 + 14 = 34.
   - Water type decreases by 8, so it becomes 40 - 8 = 32.

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Total cards = Fire type + Grass type + Water type
   - Total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

5. **Percentage of Water Type Cards:**
   - Percentage of water type cards = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100
   - Percentage of water type cards = (32 / 96) * 100

6. **Calculate the Percentage:**
   - (32 / 96) * 100 = 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%

7. **Round to the Nearest Integer:**
   - 33.33 rounded to the nearest integer is 33.

"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Chad also adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink, so we add that to the total:

$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together in one minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. We know that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. This means the number of watermelons left after the first harvest is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, Ashlyn came back two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we calculate 3/4 of 84:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the second two weeks. Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars, so the total cost of the cars is:

\[ 20,000 \times 12 = 240,000 \]

Next, Mark has to pay 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. The tax amount is:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

So, the total cost of the cars including tax is:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Now, Mark has to pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars. The total registration cost is:

\[ 1000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mike was pen pals with 5 people initially.
2. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people now.
3. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long.
4. So, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages a week.
5. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages sent by all 3 people is 3 * 10 = 30 pages a week.
6. Mike responds in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week.
7. In total, Mike sends 30 pages to others and 30 pages back, which is 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week.
8. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so for 60 pages, he spends 60 * 6 = 360 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \(32 - 4 = 28\).
3. This difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined.
4. Let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is \(x\). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \(2x\).
5. According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   28 = 2 \times 2x
   \]
6. Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[
   28 = 4x

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She needs the makeup done 4 times a week and each session takes 6 hours. The movie lasts 5 weeks.

Total hours = 4 sessions/week * 6 hours/session * 5 weeks

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = Total hours * $250/hour

Finally, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost to find out how much Jean pays.

Let's do the math:

1. Total hours = 4 * 6 * 5 = 120 hours
2. Total cost before discount = 120 * $250 = $30,000
3. Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Her sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Her sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Total cookies eaten by her sister:

3. Robert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
   - Robert went down 21 * 4 = 84 times.

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is 84."
"First, let's understand the initial setup:

- There are 10 stalls.
- Each stall has 20 cows.
- So, the total number of cows initially is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall gets an equal number of the new cows. The number of new cows each stall gets is:

\[
\frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}
\]

Now, let's determine the total number of cows in each stall after the new cows are added:

\[
20 \text{ (original cows)} + 2 \text{ (new cows)} = 22 \text{ cows per stall}
\]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:

\[
8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows per stall} = 176 \text{ cows}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

176"
"To find out how much money Brady has, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, then add them all together.

1. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. So, 100 pennies are worth:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, 40 nickels are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. So, 20 dimes are worth:
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar bills**: Each dollar bill is worth $1. So, 40 dollar bills are worth:
   \[
   40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up all the values:
\[
1 \text{ dollar} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Brady has **45 dollars** in his piggy bank."
"First, let's find out how many 10-foot sections the redwood tree has. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we divide 200 by 10:

200 / 10 = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the whole tree before the termites ate is:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, termites ate 30% of the tree's wood. To find out how much wood was eaten, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 = 2400 pounds

So, the termites ate 2400 pounds of the tree's wood. To find out how much the tree weighs after the termites ate, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

The final weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate is 5600 pounds."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books. So, the total for the books is:
   \[
   0.50 \times 8 = 4.00
   \]

2. She also has a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book overdue for more than a week.

3. Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total:
   \[

   \]

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:

- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

So, the final numerical answer is 168."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 36 cookies and then for 30 cookies.

Given that 2 cups of flour make a dozen (12) cookies, we can calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies and 30 cookies.

For 36 cookies:
- Since 12 cookies need 2 cups of flour, 36 cookies (which is 3 times 12) will need 3 times 2 cups of flour.
- So, 36 cookies need 3 * 2 = 6 cups of flour.

For 30 cookies:
- Since 12 cookies need 2 cups of flour, 30 cookies (which is 2.5 times 12) will need 2.5 times 2 cups of flour.
- So, 30 cookies need 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour.

Now, to find out the total cups of flour needed for 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow:
- Total cups of flour = 6 cups (for 36 cookies) + 5 cups (for 30 cookies) = 11 cups.

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. First, we need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.
2. Then, we convert the number of pennies into dollars, knowing that 100 pennies equal 1 dollar.

Let's do the calculation:

1. Calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
   \[
   \text{Number of pennies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
   \]

2. Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = 2 \times \frac{9300}{3} = 2 \times 3100 = 6200
   \]

3. Convert the number of pennies to dollars:
   \[
   \text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
   \]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so:
\[ \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so:
\[ \text{Harry's trees} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's trees} - \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's calculate the total price of the house that Mrs. Cruz has to pay, including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage fee**: 5% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

2. **Transfer fee**: 12% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

3. **Total price including fees**: 
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500

   \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees Mr. Tan paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the stitches of the body, so the collar takes \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

Total stitches for these parts: \(900 + 90 + 180 = 1170\) stitches.

Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the remaining stitches are for the sleeves. So, the total stitches for the sleeves is \(1800 - 1170 = 630\) stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes \(630 / 2 = 315\) stitches.

\[ \text{Cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This means the remaining cards are:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current ages of Mico and Marco:**
   - Let Mico's current age be \( M \).
   - Let Marco's current age be \( R \).

2. **Set up the equation for their current ages:**
   - According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 20.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M + R = 20
     \]

3. **Determine their ages in 10 years:**
   - In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \).
   - In 10 years, Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \).

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages in 10 years:**
   - The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20
     \]

6. **Substitute the known sum of their current ages:**
   - From the equation \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute:
     \[
     M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
     \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Now, let's add the stars from these rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. So, the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each of these rows has 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"

"First, let's find out the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles/hour and it needs to cover the same 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate:

Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
Izzy's medals = 22 - 5
Izzy's medals = 17

Now, let's add the medals Ali and Izzy have together:

Total medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals = 22 + 17
Total medals = 39

The problem states that the total medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total medals given out. This means the total medals given out is 10 times the total medals Ali and Izzy have. So, we can calculate the total medals given out as:

Total medals given out = Total medals * 10
Total medals given out = 39 * 10
Total medals given out = 390

So, the final numerical answer is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- Total cost for business suits = 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- Total cost for suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- Cost of one business suit = $100.
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
- Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for business suits = $600.
- Total cost for suitcases = $150.
- Total cost for the flight ticket = $1200.
- Total cost for all items = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend and wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the amount he can spend is:
- Amount he can spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount he can spend to find out how much he can spend on gifts:
- Amount he can spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of players on the defense be \( D \).
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. So, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
3. There are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. This can be written as:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we can find its volume by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

The length of the pool is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 5 feet.

So, the volume \( V \) of the pool is:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]
\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem says there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, if there are 30 boys, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. So, if there are 30 boys, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \text{ nongendered children}
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 \text{ (boys)} + 90 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (nongendered children)} = 123 \text{ children}
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the given ratio and use it to find the number of electric poles.

The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Let's denote the number of electric poles by \( P \) and the number of electric wires by \( W \).

According to the ratio:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given:
\[ W = 45 \]

We can substitute \( W \) into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total people: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:**
   - Number of people who left: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of people remaining: 40 - 10 = 30

3. **Given that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - Number of men who left: 25 - 22 = 3
   - Number of women who left: 10 - 3 = 7 (since 10 people left in total and 3 were men, 7 must be women)

4. **Number of women left:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Number of women who left: 7
   - Number of women remaining: 15 - 7 = 8

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the book costs $4 and the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

"To solve this, let's first find out how many pencils Jam has in boxes. We know that Jam has 2 loose pencils and a total of 26 pencils. So, the number of pencils in boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam has. Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each box, we can assume that each box contains the same number of pencils. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of pencils per box, so we'll just use the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. So, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

If we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils as Jam's boxes (which we know is 24 pencils per box), then the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils is:

\[ \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the weakening of the coffee due to the cooling and the addition of cream. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooling the Coffee:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

2. **Adding Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - Adding cream also weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters per milliliter of cream added.
   - Therefore, adding 15 milliliters of cream will make the coffee:
     \[
     15 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 180 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to cooling and the weakening due to adding cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 180 \text{ milliliters} = 240 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{240}\) milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream."
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records, and each person can get 1 new record for every 2 old records they bring, then the total number of old records brought in is:

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Number of junior programmers = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\)
- Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Next, we know the salary of a junior programmer is $2000 per month.

The salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer:
- Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Now, we calculate the total monthly payment for all junior programmers:
- Total payment for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of a junior programmer
- Total payment for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly payment for all senior programmers:
- Total payment for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Salary of a senior programmer
- Total payment for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000

Finally, we add the total payments for junior and senior programmers to find the total amount the company pays to all programmers per month:
- Total payment = Total payment for junior programmers + Total payment for senior programmers
- Total payment = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final numerical answer is:
$224,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We are told that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The phone is currently at 60% charged.
2. It needs to reach 100% charged.
3. It charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.

First, we need to find out how much more charging is needed:
100% - 60% = 40%

Now, we know that 1% charge takes 3 minutes. So, 40% charge will take:
40% * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours:
120 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase.
   - So, for $80, they get $8 off (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After using the rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - The rewards used were $8, so the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - The final price after applying the coupon is $35 - $16 = $19.

So, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Advance payment} + (\text{Number of installments} \times \text{Amount per installment}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1350 + (6 \times 350) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1350 + 2100 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3450 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:

"First, let's calculate the initial value of Maria's shares.

Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
So, the initial value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8 \text{ per share} = \$64 \]

Next, the stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase:
\[ \text{Increase} = 50\% \text{ of } \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4 \]
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at the new price of $12 each:
\[ \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12 \text{ per share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 25\% \text{ of } \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3 \]
\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at the new price of $9 each:
\[ \text{Value after second year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9 \text{ per share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money the factory makes per day now that they make silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily income from selling silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage more they are making per day now compared to when they made tractors. To do this, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they made tractors."
"To calculate how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the costs for food, treats, and medicine for each month and then multiply by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost for food per month is $25 * 4 = $100.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

So, the total monthly cost is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120 per month.

Now, to find out the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
$120 * 12 = $1440.

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog per year."
"Let's break down the activities and their durations:

1. **Monday**: Yoga class - 1 hour
2. **Tuesday**: Cooking class - 3 times the yoga class = 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours
3. **Wednesday**: Cheese-tasting event - 0.5 hour
4. **Thursday**: Museum tour - half the cooking class = 0.5 * 3 hours = 1.5 hours
5. **Friday**: Errands - 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hour
- Thursday: 1.5 hours

Total hours = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

The final numerical answer is 7.5 hours."
"First, let's figure out how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since she needs twice as many for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 plant pots for the daisies, she needs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ plant pots for the roses} \]

Now, let's add the plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses together:

\[ 30 \text{ (for daisies)} + 60 \text{ (for roses)} = 90 \text{ plant pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots she needs from the number she already bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ plant pots left over} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this, let's work backwards from the information given.

Andrea started with $36. She gave her brother $4, so before giving him the money, she had:
\[ 36 + 4 = 40 \]

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: half of boating time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 + 3 = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows.

He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

The total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
9 hours (boating and swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours

We know that the 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent. Let's find the total time he spent.

Let \( T \) be the total time he spent.
30% of \( T \) is 15 hours, so:
0.30 * \( T \) = 15
\( T \) = 15 / 0.30
\( T \) = 50 hours

Now, we know that 40% of his total time was spent sightseeing. Let's calculate that.

40% of 50 hours is:
0.40 * 50 = 20 hours

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. So, the height of the tallest tree is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

2. **Cost of One Lollipop:**
   Each lollipop costs 25 cents.

3. **Number of Lollipops Bought Each Day:**
   Marisa buys 4 lollipops every day.

4. **Cost of Lollipops Each Day:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 lollipops} = 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Converting 100 cents to dollars:
   \[
   100 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Billy spent on candy. He started with $10 and bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. So, the cost of the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half of his change is the amount he spent on candy. So, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the cost of the candy is $2. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the total cost of the candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance for the trip from the third city to the first city:**
   - The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
   - The distance from the first city to the third city is 50 miles less than the combined distance from the first to the second city and from the second to the third city.
   - Combined distance from the first to the second city and from the second to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip (first to second, second to third, and third to first) is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance for one day:**
   - The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance for one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Calculate the number of days between services:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   - To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance for one day by the service interval: \(18000 \div 900 = 20\).

So, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the stuffing needed for a collie bed:**
   - A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
   - The average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds:**
   - Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds.
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - Therefore, the total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds is:
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for the collie beds:**
   - Mark needs to make 3 collie beds.

So, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is 23 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, John took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance to his friend's house 210 miles. The time taken for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Total time to friend's house} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{41}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 5.857 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip back home is 3 hours.

Finally, the total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time to his friend's house and the time back home:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \frac{41}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{41}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

- The interest rate (R) is 10% per year, which is 0.10 as a decimal.
- The time (T) is 5 months, which is 5/12 of a year.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Let's calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.5875 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.5875 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.5875 \]

Now, Karan has to pay this amount back over 5 months, so we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.5875}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.5175 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Karan has to pay:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.52 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
760.52"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has:
- 50 silver pesos
- 80 gold pesos

Anna has:
- Twice as many silver pesos as Axel: \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) silver pesos
- 40 more gold pesos than Axel: \( 80 + 40 = 120 \) gold pesos

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

Total silver pesos:
- Axel's silver pesos: 50
- Anna's silver pesos: 100
- Total: \( 50 + 100 = 150 \) silver pesos

Total gold pesos:
- Axel's gold pesos: 80
- Anna's gold pesos: 120
- Total: \( 80 + 120 = 200 \) gold pesos

Total number of pesos:
- Total silver pesos: 150
- Total gold pesos: 200
- Total: \( 150 + 200 = 350 \)

So, the final numerical answer is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:

3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups

Next, we need to find out how much money she makes by selling all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

36 cups * $1/cup = $36

Now, we know that Millie spent $18 to buy the supplies. To find out her profit, we subtract the cost from the total revenue:

$36 - $18 = $18

Millie sells all the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she sells lemonade:

$18 / 4 hours = $4.50/hour

So, the final numerical answer is $4.50 per hour."
"To solve this, let's denote the total land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( L \) hectares.

According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The remaining land is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5} L = 12.8 \]

To find \( L \), we need to solve for \( L \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ L = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

To make the multiplication easier, we can break it down:
\[ 12.8 \times 2.5 = 12.8 \times \left(2 + 0.5\right) = 12.8 \times 2 + 12.8 \times 0.5 \]
\[ 12.8 \times 2 = 25.6 \]
\[ 12.8 \times 0.5 = 6.4 \]
\[ 25.6 + 6.4 = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of boys and girls as follows:

- Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26
- Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

So, there are 26 girls in the choir. When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of people performing is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of the 26 girls can't make it:

- Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13
- Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

So, the final numerical answer is:

16"

- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.

\[
\text{Cost of erasers} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.

\[
\text{Cost of pencils} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

Now, to find the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

\[ \text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 88 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, each ride costs $4. For 9 rides, Dasha would need:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars per ride} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's compare the costs:
- David spends $30 on the ride bracelet.
- Dasha spends $36 on tickets.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the amount David spends from the amount Dasha spends:
\[ 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, David saves:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this, we need to find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow.

First, let's add up all the gifts she needs to wrap:
- Gifts for family: 6
- Gifts for friends: 4
- Gifts for teachers: 2

Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to use it for all 12 gifts.

To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts:

\[ \text{Inches of ribbon per gift} = \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} \]

\[ \text{Inches of ribbon per gift} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, and then determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \). According to the problem, the ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6} \]

This ratio tells us that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. We can express this relationship as:
\[ B = \frac{5}{6}S \]

We also know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Now, we can substitute \( B = \frac{5}{6}S \) into the total equation:
\[ \frac{5}{6}S + S = 165 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{5S}{6} + \frac{6S}{6} = 165 \]
\[ \frac{11S}{6} = 165 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ 11S = 990 \]
\[ S = 90 \]

Now that we know Sam has 90 popsicles, we can find out how many popsicles Betty has by substituting \( S = 90 \) back into the equation \( B = \frac{5}{6}S \):
\[ B = \frac{5}{6} \times 90 = 75 \]

So, Betty has 75 popsicles and Sam has 90 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the costs:

1. **Netflix**: $10 a month
2. **Hulu and Disney Plus normally**: $10 each, so $10 + $10 = $20 a month
3. **Savings on Hulu and Disney Plus**: 20% off, so 20% of $20 = $4, meaning he pays $20 - $4 = $16 a month for both.

Now, let's add up the costs for the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16

Total cost for streaming services: $10 + $16 = $26 a month.

Tim used to pay $60 a month for cable. Now he pays $26 a month for streaming services.

So, the amount of money he saves is: $60 - $26 = $34.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time Carol spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording it: half of 4 hours = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
240 (writing) + 120 (recording) + 90 (editing) = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, and then add 20 more books to that total.

- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
- Each slot can hold one book.

So, the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots} \]

Next, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books in the slots as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 36 \).

Now, we need to calculate double the number of books:
\[ 2 \times B = 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 more books to this doubled amount:
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of books Wendy will need to carry is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards from her dad is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
3. Adding the cards Erica made and the cards her dad brought, we get \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

1. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
2. She gave 5 cards to her family.
3. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, we subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received:

\[
50 - 24 - 5 + 17

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:

"First, let's calculate how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day before the reduction.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour and is used for 8 hours a day. So, the energy used per day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours, the energy used per day in kilowatt-hours is:
\[ \frac{7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day}}{1000} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the new usage time is:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours/day} - 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 3 \, \text{hours/day} \]

The new energy usage per day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \]
\[ \frac{2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day}}{1000} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

The energy saved per day is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kWh/day} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh/day} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kWh} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - There are 20 people and each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Number of sandwiches = 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total meat needed = 5 pounds.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total cheese needed = 5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cost of 5 pounds of meat = 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
   - Cost of 5 pounds of cheese = 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. We know that he has twice as much corn as cannolis. Given that he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the initial number of corns as follows:

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find out how many corns Allan has after buying 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis now, the number of corns he has is:

\[ \text{Number of corns} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Finally, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis, we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = \text{Number of corns} + \text{Number of cannolis} = 60 + 100 = 160 \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ 160 \]

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps there and back. Then he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After these, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can subtract the steps he had left from his goal and the steps he already took:

10,000 (his goal) - 5,000 (to and from school) - 1,000 (short walk) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000 steps.

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words.
So, the total number of words is \( 45 \times 200 = 9000 \) words.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. He reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.

The time it takes to read the book is \( \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport.

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will finish reading 30 minutes before he needs to leave the airport.

Therefore, Toby will be \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) minutes early.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked by the employees in May. Each employee works 40 hours a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so each employee works:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ hours} \]
Since 40 employees were hired in May, the total number of hours worked by all employees in May is:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 160 \text{ hours/employee} = 6400 \text{ hours} \]
Each employee is paid $15 per hour, so the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many employees' contracts expired in June. Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, the number of employees who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]
This means that 30 employees remained in June. Each of these 30 employees worked 160 hours in June, so the total number of hours worked by the remaining employees in June is:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 160 \text{ hours/employee} = 4800 \text{ hours} \]
The total amount paid to the remaining employees in June is:
\[ 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{168000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale as ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means for 2 pounds, the first pound costs $3 and the second pound costs $3/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the seashells is $1.50 * 4 = $6.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 of them. So, the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of taffy: $4.50
- Cost of seashells: $6.00
- Cost of magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $6.00 + $1.00 = $11.50

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $11.50 = -$1.50

Since Sally does not have enough money to cover the total cost, she is short by $1.50. The final numerical answer is:

-1.50"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost for the two packs is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. For 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are both dangerous and defective. 

First, we know that 5% of the candles are dangerous. So, we calculate 5% of 50,000:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, 2,500 candles are dangerous. According to the problem, 5% of these dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, we calculate 5% of 2,500:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2,500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 2,500 = 0.05 \times 2,500 = 125 \]

So, 125 of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 125 \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount price for each blouse. The regular price is $20, and there's a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount, we multiply the regular price by the discount percentage:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price for each blouse is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Joanne gathered:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: half of 30, which is 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: let's denote this number as \( x \).

2. **Determine the number of apples Joanne's sister gathered:**
   - From the tallest trees: twice as many as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: three times as many as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:**
   - Joanne's total: \( 30 + 15 + x \).
   - Her sister's total: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 150 + x \).

4. **Set up the equation based on the total number of apples gathered:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer.

\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's say the number of camels is \( c \) and the number of dromedaries is \( d \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To eliminate \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for this day is 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, let's add up all the distances:

- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled during the trip: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \).

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Zack's locker size:**
   - We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
   - Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker.
   - So, Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

2. **Determine Timothy's locker size:**
   - Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's locker.
   - So, Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet). Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To find Stanley's comb, Oliver needs to climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet. 

So, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The final numerical answer is 3,000 feet."
"The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so it gave him 2 * $4000 = $8000. So in total, he got $4000 + $8000 = $12000. If he initially had $5000 in capital, now he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

The final capital Mr. Josue has now is $17000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).
5. The number of cats left on the rock after some ran away is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"Let's break down the cost step by step:

1. **First 6 months**: $8 per month.
   - Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8)**: $12 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 12 months (months 9 to 20)**: $14 per month.
   - Total cost for the next 12 months = 12 months * $14/month = $168.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

For the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

For the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, let's add them all up:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."

2. Each of the store-bought bird feeders attracts 20 birds.
3. Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds expected to come to the feeders each day:

- The 3 store-bought bird feeders will attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
- The 3 bird feeders Lillian made will attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds expected to come to her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Kenny sells his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each and keeps 1/3 of them. This means he sells 2/3 of them. He gets $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket for $100, so he has $50 - $100 = -$50. This means he needs $50 more to buy the ticket.

Let's say Kenny started with \( x \) cards. He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them. The number of cards he sells is \( \frac{2}{3}x \). Since he sells each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he gets from selling the cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

We know that this amount is $50, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests**: 36
2. **Hotdogs prepared for initial guests**: 
   - Half of the guests would eat 2 hotdogs each.
   - Half of 36 is 18.
   - So, 18 guests would eat 2 hotdogs each, which totals to \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.

3. **Actual number of guests**: 40
4. **Hotdogs prepared for 40 guests**: 
   - Since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hotdog, we need to prepare enough hotdogs for 40 guests, each wanting 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each wanting 2 hotdogs, is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs.

5. **Hotdogs prepared**: 36
6. **Hotdogs needed**: 80
7. **Hotdogs short**: \(80 - 36 = 44\) hotdogs

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, 44 more hotdogs are needed. However, the question asks how many guests did not get a second hotdog, which means we need to find out how many guests did not get their second hotdog.

8. **Number of guests who got their second hotdog**: 40
9. **Number of guests who did not get their second hotdog**: \(40 - \text{number of guests who got their second hotdog}\)

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, only 36 guests could get their second hotdog. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get their second hotdog is:

Now, add these amounts together to get the total cost before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The items are 20% off, so we need to calculate 20% of $165.00 and subtract it from the total:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5.

99% of $5 is calculated as:
\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars.

Next, we know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents. Since George bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost for the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took for both Jon and James to complete the triathlon and then determine how long it took James to run.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon
  \[ 10\% \text{ of 40 minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes} \]
  \[ \text{Time for James' swim} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- Bike: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon
  \[ \text{Time for James' bike} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

- Run: We need to find this time. Let's denote the time James took to run as \( R \) minutes.

Total time for James:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting up the equation for James' total time:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

Movie B length = Movie C length + 5 minutes
Movie B length = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B length = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

Movie A length = Movie B length / 4
Movie A length = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A length = 20 minutes

The final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to calculate how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Michael's horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass needs 5 eggs, so we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many trays she can put out. Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. So, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2 trays"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after he scores 26 points:

Joey's initial points: 214
Points Joey scores: 26

Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

Marcy's initial points: 225
Points Marcy scores: 10

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is winning:

Joey's new score: 240
Marcy's new score: 235

Difference in points = Joey's new score - Marcy's new score
Difference in points = 240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from 17 sneakers} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the rest of the sneakers sold to the department store are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[ \text{Revenue from 31 sneakers} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is the cost price of all 48 sneakers, which is $576. So, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the 4 packets with 16 pieces each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 pieces of crayons.

The final numerical answer is:
112"
"Let's break down the costs:

- Super ticket cost: $20
- Movie ticket cost: $12
- Popcorn and soda cost: $1 extra

So, the total cost for the regular ticket and the regular popcorn and soda would be:
- Movie ticket: $12
- Popcorn: let's call this price P
- Soda: $3
- Popcorn and soda: $1 extra

The total cost for the regular ticket and the regular popcorn and soda would be:
- Movie ticket: $12
- Popcorn: P
- Soda: $3
- Popcorn and soda: $1 extra

So, the total cost is:
- $12 + P + $3 + $1 = $16 + P

You saved $2 by buying the regular ticket and popcorn and soda, so the cost of the regular ticket and the regular popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
- $16 + P = $20 - $2
- $16 + P = $18

Now, we solve for P:
- $16 + P = $18
- P = $18 - $16
- P = $2

So, the regular price of popcorn is $2.

The final numerical answer is:
$2"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results together:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050
     \]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- For the second part, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

Now, let's add up the total distance and the total time:
- Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.
- Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 for 2 rubies. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Now, we need to consider the value of the rubies she received. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of her 2 rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels. The total value is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

So, the final numerical answer is:
$6400"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apples Marin eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
3. Add the number of apples Marin and Nancy eat together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
- Width = 2 feet
- Length = 8 feet
- Height = 2 feet

So, the volume of one raised bed is:
\[ 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:
\[ \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:
\[ 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 15 red cards.
2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. So, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]
3. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]
4. Now, we add up all the cards to find the total number of cards:
   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 78."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

3. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that Katelyn initially saw. So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To solve this, let's first find the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

So, the total number of puppies is:
8 (from Jennifer's dog) + 12 (from Brandon's dog) = 20 puppies

The total number of puppies with spots is:
3 (from Jennifer's dog) + 4 (from Brandon's dog) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"To solve this, let's add up the total weight of each type of feed:

- Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds = 48 pounds
- Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights to get the total weight of the feed:

Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles each week and then multiply that by four weeks.

First, let's calculate the value of the cans she recycles each week:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

So, the value from aluminum cans per week is:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents per can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the bottles she recycles each week:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

So, the value from plastic bottles per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents per bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the value from the cans and the bottles to find the total value Grayson earns each week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, to find out how much Grayson earns in a four-week month, we multiply the weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 45 \text{ cents} = 900 \text{ cents} \]

Becky received a $1 discount, which is 100 cents. So, the final amount Becky paid is:
\[ 900 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents} = 800 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for the apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 1000 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount. A 10 percent discount on 1000 cents is:
\[ 1000 \text{ cents} \times 0.10 = 100 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final amount Kelly paid is:
\[ 1000 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents} = 900 \text{ cents} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks.
2. According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus two extra. So, the number of cookies is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).
3. We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 3

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the shark is 10 feet long:
10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras:
2 remoras * 6 inches/remora = 12 inches

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches (the combined length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches).

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the ""Part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""Whole"" is the shark's length (120 inches):
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
10%"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's assume the total number of students at the grade level is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
3. We know that the number of students who do not have a desktop computer is 20. So, one-fourth of the total number of students is 20.
4. We can set up the equation: \(\frac{1}{4}x = 20\).
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4: \( x = 20 \times 4 = 80 \).

So, the total number of students at the grade level is 80.

The final numerical answer is:
80"
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Jason needs to walk in total to break in the shoes. We know it takes 240 minutes.

Jason wants to break in the shoes in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason plans to walk 4 days a week. So, in 3 weeks, he will walk:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day. We divide the total minutes by the number of days he will walk:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes per day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can find the total number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now, Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, each child got 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"To solve this, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to something and then subtract that number from the total number of kids in the class.

First, let's find out how many kids are allergic to something. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To avoid counting the kids allergic to both twice, we subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the total number allergic to peanuts:

\[ 6 \text{ (allergic to peanuts)} - 3 \text{ (allergic to both)} = 3 \text{ (only allergic to peanuts)} \]

Now, we add the kids allergic to dairy and the kids only allergic to peanuts:

\[ 9 \text{ (allergic to dairy)} + 3 \text{ (only allergic to peanuts)} = 12 \text{ (allergic to something)} \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to something. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class:

\[ 32 \text{ (total kids)} - 12 \text{ (allergic to something)} = 20 \text{ (not allergic to anything)} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 20."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and Tom and his wife are going together, so the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, let's find out the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but it is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend. So, the weekend price is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]
This means the hotel costs $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny and then add it to the weight of the 1959 penny.

1. The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains.
2. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]
3. Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to get the combined weight:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains. Let's confirm this with a simple Python code.
```python
# Given data
weight_1959_penny = 48  # weight of the 1959 penny in grains

# Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny
weight_2010_penny = (3/4) * weight_1959_penny

# Calculate the combined weight
combined_weight = weight_1959_penny + weight_2010_penny
print(combined_weight)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of oats each horse needs per day:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse eats \( 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed for all horses per day:**
   - Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
   - Each horse needs 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, the total oats needed per day for all horses is \( 4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed for all horses for five days:**
   - The total oats needed per day is 40 pounds.
   - For five days, the total oats needed is \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Determine how many bags of oats are needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total pounds of oats by the pounds per bag: \( \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \).

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors. Normally, each pack costs $4.00, but they are on sale for ""buy one get one free"". So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack. That means she pays $4.00 for 2 packs.

2. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. So, after using the coupon, she only pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 for 2 packs of razors.

3. Each pack normally has 4 razors. So, 2 packs will have 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

4. Heather paid $2.00 for 8 razors. To find out how much each razor costs, we divide $2.00 by 8. 

   $2.00 ÷ 8 = $0.25

5. Since the question asks for the final numerical answer in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents. 

   $0.25 = 25 cents

So, the final numerical answer is 25."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. 

First, let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:

- There are 4 girls on the bottom layer.
- There are 3 girls on the second layer.
- There are 2 girls on the third layer.
- The shortest girl is at the top, which is 60"" tall.

So, the total height of the pyramid is:

Let's calculate this step by step:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \]
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \]
\[ 60 = 60 \]

Now, add these heights together:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \]

The total height of the pyramid is 636 inches. To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then find the number of guests where these costs are equal.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

### First Venue:
- The flat fee is $200.
- Each guest costs $25.
- Food for each guest costs $5.
- Therefore, the total cost at the first venue is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost at first venue} = 200 + 25n + 5n = 200 + 30n

### Second Venue:
- The cost per guest is $25.
- Food for each guest is included in the price.
- Therefore, the total cost at the second venue is:

"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. It's also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
4. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4D + 7 = 43
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   4D = 36
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   D = 9
   \]
8. Now we know David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:
   \[
   D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. Together, they used 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 of a skein.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, 3/4 of a skein would be 364 * 3/4 = 273 yards.

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends.

2 friends want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

3 friends want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Now, add the gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts as a surprise:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} \]

Now, add the gifts for her friends and the surprise gifts:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:

"First, let's find out the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet wide.

Now, we know the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is:

2 * 8 feet = 16 feet.

So, the couch is 2 feet longer than 16 feet, which means:

16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.
5. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost of the gum is the sum of the costs of the strawberry gum, the grape gum, and the green apple gum. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2x = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 4 \]
\[ x = \frac{4}{2} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. Let's confirm this by checking the total cost:

- Two packs of strawberry gum: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
- One pack of grape gum: $2.
- One pack of green apple gum: $1.

Total cost: \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \) dollars, which matches the given total.

Therefore, the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To solve this, let's first calculate how many popsicle sticks Frederick can get from each type of wood.

For 2 x 4 piece of wood:
- He can get 200 sticks from one piece.
- The cost of one 2 x 4 piece is $4.
- With $24, he can buy $24 / $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

So, from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he can get 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.

For 2 x 8 piece of wood:
- He can get 400 sticks from one piece.
- The cost of one 2 x 8 piece is $6.
- With $24, he can buy $24 / $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.

So, from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can get 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 wood, which gives him more sticks.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1200."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs and each pair of snowshoes covers one dog, Mario needs 6 pairs of snowshoes (one for each dog).

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

6 pairs * $12.00/pair = $72.00

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To solve this, let's first calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips without a weekly pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost of the bus pass is $20 per week.

To find out how much Janet would save by buying the bus pass, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

The final numerical answer is:
120"
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. If Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can find out how many Sophia bought by dividing the number of items Rose bought by 4.

For onions: \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) onions
For potatoes: \( \frac{4}{4} = 1 \) potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:

\( 3 + 1 = 4 \)

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Andy has until his birthday and then calculate the daily calorie deficit he needs to achieve his goal.

1. **Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th:**
   - December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 19th is 19 days.
   - January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 19th is 19 days.
   - February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to February 19th is 19 days.
   - March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 19th is 19 days.
   - April has 30 days, so from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
   - May has 31 days, so from May 1st to May 19th is 19 days.
   - June has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 19th is 19 days.
   - July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

   Adding these up: 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 + 19 = 126 days.

2. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds:**
   - Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound.
   - To lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve:**
   - To lose 30 pounds in 126 days, Andy needs to burn 105,000 calories over 126 days.
   - Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Number of days = 105,000 / 126 = 833.33 calories.

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of 833.33 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 per day and he works for 7 days in a week, so his total earnings for the week are:

"First, let's calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = \$100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie has:

\[ \$500 - \$100 = \$400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = \$100 \]

After buying CDs, Julie has:

\[ \$400 - \$100 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Julie has left is:

"Let's call the cost of the lot ""L"" and the cost of the house ""H"". According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house by using the first equation:

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 90,000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of 8 * 5 = 40 canvas bags. Each pack costs $4, so the total cost is 8 * $4 = $32.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so her total revenue is 40 * $8 = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $32 = $288.

So, the final numerical answer is:
288"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total money to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first calculate double the time Rob takes:

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the 40 minutes extra that Royce takes:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To solve this, let's calculate the total number of each item Martha needs to make for her 3 grandchildren:

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, to find out how many quarts of strawberries all four can pick per hour, we add their individual rates:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Adding these together: \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts per hour.

3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon: 107 - 39 = 68 loaves.
4. Add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store: 68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. He has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of red tulips is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows of blue tulips is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows} \]

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows Jackson will plant:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

So, we divide 27 by 3/4:

\[ 27 \div \frac{3}{4} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 36 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device.

1. **Daily consumption before adding the new device:**
   - Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour.
   
2. **Daily consumption after adding the new device:**
   - New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour.
   - Total daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Next, we need to calculate the weekly consumption for both scenarios.

3. **Weekly consumption before adding the new device:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours.

4. **Weekly consumption after adding the new device:**
   - Weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours.

Now, we need to calculate the cost for both scenarios.

5. **Cost before adding the new device:**
   - Cost per kilowatt-hour: $1.50.
   - Weekly cost: 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

6. **Cost after adding the new device:**
   - Weekly cost: 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

Finally, we need to find the difference between the two weekly costs.

7. **Difference in weekly costs:**
   - Difference: $147 - $126 = $21.

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"First, let's figure out how much one person can paint in one day. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \div 5 \text{ days} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

So, one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day. Now, if we have 5 people working together, the amount of the house they can paint in one day is:

\[
5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. To paint a whole house, they would need:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house} \times 2 = 1 \text{ house}
\]

Since they can paint half a house in one day, to paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[
1 \text{ day}
\]

Now, we need to convert this into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take:

\[
1 \text{ day} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 24 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
24

1. **Determine the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \).
   - Therefore, \( C_O = 20 + 2 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \).
   - Therefore, \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - According to the problem, Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Let's denote the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \).
   - Therefore, \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.
   - Total sofas = 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84.
   - Total chairs = 22 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 88.
   - Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 (sofas) + 88 (chairs) = 172.

The final numerical answer is 172."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the headphone set:**
   - Tom paid a total of $48.
   - He bought a CD for $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
     \[
     48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - With $44, the number of CDs Tom could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ CDs}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set:**
   - If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have $48.
   - With $48, the number of CDs he could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference in the number of CDs:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom could buy 12 CDs.
   - With the headphone set, he could buy 11 CDs.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for two specific weeks.
- In two weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- In one week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, we calculate the total hours worked out in the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours each week:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the hours worked out in the two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add the hours worked out in the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 80\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times as many as those who got off, which is \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(80 - 21 + 63 = 122\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of the computer**: $1,100
2. **Cost of the printer**: $400 less than the computer, so $1,100 - $400 = $700
3. **Total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer**: $2,400

First, we need to find the total cost of the 2 monitors. We know the total cost of all items is $2,400. So, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from this total:

\[
\text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of computer} - \text{Cost of printer}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600
\]

Now, to find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:

\[
\text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. Each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.
2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, so he now has $6 + $5 = $11.
3. The following day, the eldest boy adds another $10 to his share, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He then spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.
5. After saving some more, he triples the amount he had left after spending the $8. So, he triples $13, which gives him $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39.

Let's confirm this with a simple calculation in code.
```python
# Initial amount shared among 3 boys
initial_amount = 18
number_of_boys = 3

# Each boy's initial share
initial_share = initial_amount / number_of_boys

# Eldest boy's share after adding $5
eldest_share_after_first_addition = initial_share + 5

# Eldest boy's share after adding $10
eldest_share_after_second_addition = eldest_share_after_first_addition + 10

# Eldest boy's share after spending $8
eldest_share_after_spending = eldest_share_after_second_addition - 8

# Eldest boy's share after tripling the remaining amount
final_amount = eldest_share_after_spending * 3

Next, we calculate how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80. We do this by dividing the total amount he wants to save by the amount he earns in a week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"First, let's find out how much the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs. If the foot-long fish sub costs $40 and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much, then:

Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * Cost of foot-long fish sub
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Now, let's add the cost of both subs to find the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

So, the final numerical answer is $160."
"First, let's find out how many buttons had four holes. Since there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes, the rest had four holes.

So, the number of buttons with four holes is:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes. There are 7 buttons with two holes each and 14 buttons with four holes each.

The total number of holes from the buttons with two holes is:
7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes

The total number of holes from the buttons with four holes is:
14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of holes in all the buttons:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

So, the final numerical answer is:
70"
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, and Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as follows:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we can calculate Peter's locker size as follows:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Octavia's coffee intake:**
   - The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, but we know Octavia drinks half of that.
   - Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).
   - Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

2. **Determine Juan's coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
   - Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

3. **Juan's doctor's recommendation:**
   - Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
   - This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) cups to 4 cups.

4. **Calculate the reduction needed:**
   - The reduction in cups of coffee is \( 5R - 4 \).

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can't calculate the exact numerical value of the reduction. However, the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups of coffee.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]"
"To solve this, let's count the hamsters and guinea pigs separately.

For the hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

For the guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

- Add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

So, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we have the weights of all three friends:
- Mark: 150 pounds
- Susan: 130 pounds
- Bob: 260 pounds

To find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and then divide by 3:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
Average weight = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

So, the final numerical answer is 180 pounds."
"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees up from the pyramid every hour.
3. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at 32 degrees from the ground.
4. The sun moves for 10 hours.

To find out how many degrees the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours, we need to add the total movement of the sun to the initial angle of the pyramid from the ground.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial angle of the pyramid from the ground:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
82"
"To solve this, let's first find out how old the two sons are.

The older son is 12 years old.

The younger son is 4 years younger, so:
12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we know that James needs candles for both sons, so he needs 2 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3, but he only needs 2 candles. We can calculate how many packs he needs by dividing the number of candles he needs by the number of candles in a pack:

2 candles ÷ 5 candles/pack = 0.4 packs.

Since he can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 full pack to have enough candles.

So, he spends $3 on candles.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total minutes she read in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the second week. We know she read a total of 100 pages in the second week.

Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate how many minutes she read in the first week, which we already know is 105 minutes. So, the number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

Finally, we add the pages she read in the first week and the second week to get the total number of pages she read in two weeks:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
2. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. The problem also states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]
4. Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we calculate:
\[ \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) during which he spends money on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the total cost for wooden action figures is:
\[ \text{Cost of wooden action figures} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
Since he spends $10 each day, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is $20, which means he bought:
\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

After buying the wooden action figures, the remaining money is:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $50 is:
\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:
\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 4 + 25 = 29 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's first calculate how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week and then find out how many he needs to supply in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order:
- First shop: 20 roses
- Second shop: 15 roses
- Third shop: 30 roses

So, the total number of roses supplied to the shops each week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Now, let's find out how many roses are needed in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses needed:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses/month

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To solve this, we need to calculate how much money Katina will have left after 2 years if she removes $100 every month.

First, let's find out how many months are in 2 years:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Katina will remove over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times $100/\text{month} = $2400 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[ $3000 - $2400 = $600 \]

So, the final amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:

"To solve this, let's break down the costs and revenue step by step.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - They spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of bread for 1 sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheese and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 1 sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - The total cost for 1 sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments.
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Profit per Sandwich:**
   - Profit per sandwich = Revenue per sandwich - Cost per sandwich.
   - Profit per sandwich = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.

6. **Total Profit for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - If they sell 10 sandwiches, the total profit is 10 times the profit per sandwich.
   - Total profit = 10 * $3.70 = $37.00.

So, their net profit for selling 10 sandwiches is $37.00."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off and then use that percentage to determine the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage off is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting.

Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would give an actual temperature of 520 degrees, knowing that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( T \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be:
\[ T - 0.04T = 520 \]
\[ 0.96T = 520 \]
\[ T = \frac{520}{0.96} \]

- So, the total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- So, the total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to find out how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories:
- For 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, she drinks (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

So, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans.

2. **Express Red and Green Jelly Beans in Terms of Blue Jelly Beans:**
   According to the note, the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is:
   \[
   R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
   \]
   The jar also contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B
   \]

3. **Set Up the Total Jelly Beans Equation:**
   The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   R + B + G = 4500
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
   \[
   0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
   \]

4. **Combine Like Terms:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B = 4500
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   \[
   B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
   \]

6. **Calculate the Number of Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   Using \( B = 1500 \):
   \[
   R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
   \]
   \[
   G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
   \]

7. **Determine the Difference Between Green and Red Jelly Beans:**
   \[
   G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the number of green jelly beans is 30 more than the number of red jelly beans.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
2. After some lessons, his speed increased to 52 WPM.
3. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

Now we have three measurements: 47, 52, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and then divide by the number of measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

Let's do the math:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5 weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
- Weight gain from eating donuts: 8.75 pounds
- Weight loss from eating Cheerios: 6.25 pounds
- Difference in weight:
  \[
  8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \( 5 \times 44 = 220 \) pounds.

The final numerical answer is 220 pounds."
"To solve this, let's calculate the total cost for each place Marilyn would buy the boots.

On Amazon:
- The boots cost $16.
- Shipping costs $4.
- Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- Shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's $4 * 2 = $8.
- Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- Difference = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon = $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet (the height of Mark's window).

1. **Day 0 (initial height):** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
2. **Day 1:** The height doubles to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet.
3. **Day 2:** The height doubles to \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet.
4. **Day 3:** The height doubles to \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet.

We can see that on Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet of Mark's window. 

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Let's break this down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's age 5 years ago was \( x \).
2. Then, Jerry's current age is \( x + 5 \).
3. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 5 = 2x
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 = 2x \implies 5 = 2x - x \implies 5 = x

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees. The other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy with the money he has.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
   \[
   8 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 200 \text{ cents}
   \]
   Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs he can buy with quarters is:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/gumball}} = 40 \text{ gumballs}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
   \[
   6 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]
   The number of gumballs he can buy with dimes is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/gumball}} = 12 \text{ gumballs}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[
   14 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ cents/nickel} = 70 \text{ cents}

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[
   15 \text{ pennies} \times 1 \text{ cent/penny} = 15 \text{ cents}
   \]
   The number of gumballs he can buy with pennies is:
   \[
   \frac{15 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/gumball}} = 3 \text{ gumballs}

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel an additional 2000 miles."
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2 to find the amount he makes in one hour:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in one hour. So we calculate 3/4 of 60 pounds:

3/4 * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour

Now we know that Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour and Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour. Together, they make:

60 pounds/hour (Ruiz) + 45 pounds/hour (Marissa) = 105 pounds per hour

They worked for 12 hours in a day, so the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

105 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds

So the final numerical answer is 1260 pounds."

"First, let's calculate how many times the tires rotate in a month. We know that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times. So, for 400 miles, the tires rotate:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per 725 rotations}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} \]

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations} \]

Now, we know each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} \]

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} \]

\[ \text{Years per tire} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years."
"To solve this, we need to find out how many times Jackie can get 120 washings with 1 pump, and then calculate the cost per pump.

Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, so for 120 washes, she would need 120 pumps.

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35, and there's a 30% off sale.
The discount on the shorts is 30% of $35:
\[ 0.30 \times 35 = 10.50 \]
So, the shorts will cost:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:

$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00
\]

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"Let's break down the growth of the beanstalk week by week:

1. **First Week:** The beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
2. **Second Week:** It doubled in height. So, \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) inches.
3. **Third Week:** It grew another 4 inches. So, \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) inches.

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To solve this, we need to find out how much meat Prince can sell in a day and then see how many days it will take to sell the 750kg of meat from the bull.

Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. So, in one day, he sells:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750kg of meat at the rate of 150kg per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:**
   - There are 4 rows of seats.
   - Each row has 18 seats.
   - Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats.

2. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:**
   - One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.
   - Number of seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 seats = 18 seats.

3. **Calculate the number of seats remaining after administrators:**
   - Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats.

4. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:**
   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
   - Number of seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 seats = 18 seats.

5. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students:**
   - The rest of the seats were occupied by the students.
   - Number of seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats.

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of poles at each intersection:**
   Each intersection has 6 poles.

2. **Calculate the total number of poles across all intersections:**
   There are 4 intersections, so the total number of poles is:
   \[
   6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of street lights:**
   Each pole has 4 street lights, so the total number of street lights is:
   \[
   24 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 96 \text{ street lights}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of functioning street lights:**
   If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
   \[
   96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
76

"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played to the total number of times they can be played before breaking.

The first DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 356 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ more times} \]

The second DVD can be played 1000 times and has been played 135 times, so it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ more times} \]

Now, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[ 1509 \]"
"To find out how much John's physical therapy cost, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of therapy sessions John had:**
   - John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   - Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
   - Therefore, each week he had \(2 \times 2 = 4\) sessions.
   - Over 6 weeks, the total number of sessions is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

2. **Calculate the total time John spent in therapy:**
   - Each session is 2 hours long.

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**:
   - Jim is at school for 8 hours.
   - He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours.
   - So, in 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum.

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**:
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**:
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**:
   - After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.
   - Let's calculate the remaining gum after chewing and before giving to his sister.

   - After chewing 4 pieces during school, 1 piece on the way home, and 1 piece after dinner, Jim has \( 20 - 4 - 1 - 1 = 14 \) pieces left.
   - He gives half of these 14 pieces to his sister, so he gives \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces to his sister.
   - Therefore, Jim has \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces left.

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."

   - Each row has 20 flowers.
   - Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers.

2. **Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed:**
   - We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed.
   - To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5.
   - Number of bloomed flowers = 200 flowers * 4/5 = 200 * 0.8 = 160 flowers.

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is 160."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second.
2. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
3. So, in one hour, Ashley can get 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds = 72000 kb in total.
4. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we need to convert 72000 kb to Mb.
5. To do this, we divide 72000 kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per hour: 72000 / 1000 = 72 Mb.

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day.
   - Number of cars pulled in the first three days = \(10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}\).

2. **Remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than the first three days.
   - Number of cars pulled each day in the remaining four days = \(10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day}\).
   - Number of cars pulled in the remaining four days = \(6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}\).

3. **Total number of cars pulled in the week:**
   - Total number of cars = Number of cars pulled in the first three days + Number of cars pulled in the remaining four days.

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height in inches by 12:

40 inches ÷ 12 = 3.3333 feet

Now, we need to find out how many more feet Adam needs to grow to reach the 4 feet required to ride the roller coaster:

4 feet - 3.3333 feet = 0.6667 feet

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to 2/12 = 0.1667 feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 0.6667 feet, we divide the height he needs to grow by his yearly growth rate:

0.6667 feet ÷ 0.1667 feet/year = 4 years

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold. Each car costs $25,000, so:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. So, the company's cost for the 10 cars is:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.30 = 75,000 \]

The profit from selling the cars is the total sales minus the company's cost:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, let's find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are women. Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

This means the remaining riders must be men. To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
4. Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is 4800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add up the number of each type of stamp:
\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's calculate the maximum total cost for 10 classes if each class costs $10:
\[ 10 \text{ classes} \times \$10 \text{ per class} = \$100 \]

Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $100. Manny's initial cost is $60, so the remaining cost he can afford is:
\[ \$100 - \$60 = \$40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss while still staying within the $40 limit. Let's denote the number of classes he can miss as \( x \). The cost of the remaining classes will be:
\[ 10 - x \text{ classes} \]

The cost of these remaining classes should not exceed $40:
\[ (10 - x) \times \text{cost per class} \leq 40 \]

Since the cost per class is $10 (as it's the maximum allowed cost per class), we have:
\[ (10 - x) \times 10 \leq 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 10 - x \leq 4 \]
\[ 10 - 4 \leq x \]
\[ 6 \leq x \]

So, Manny can miss up to 6 classes before the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many customers Julie processes in a day. Since Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers per day}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many customers they process together in a day. Jewel processes 50 customers and Julie processes 100 customers, so together they process:
   \[
   50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers per day}
   \]

3. To find out how many customers they process in a week, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in a week (7 days):
   \[
   150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers per week}
   \]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so:
\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we subtract 3 from Reggie's distance:
\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final numerical answer is:
17"
"To solve this, let's first find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, 1 apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, 1 orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10

Now, to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- 5 apples cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
- 5 oranges cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

So, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

The final numerical answer is $12.00."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is what the hole is) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 216 seconds."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. King cab upgrade: $7,500
2. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
3. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
4. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:

$7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded lights) = $13,500

Now, add the base price of the truck to the total extra costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $13,500 (extra features) = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the raise:**
   - Tim's raise is 5% of his $20000 salary.
   - 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000.

2. **Calculate the bonus:**
   - The bonus is half a month's salary.
   - Half a month's salary = 1/2 * $20000 = $10000.

3. **Calculate the new monthly salary:**
   - New monthly salary = Original salary + Raise + Bonus
   - New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000.

4. **Calculate the annual salary:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Annual salary = New monthly salary * 12

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - The cost of each dress pant is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of each dress pant = 1/5 * $750 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Fishio received 2000 likes after 1 week.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is \(70 \times 2000 = 140000\).
3. Recently, she received 20000 more likes. So, we add these 20000 likes to the 140000 likes she had after three weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total number of likes:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the final number of Instagram likes is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
Total cost before discount = 20 * $20 = $400

She got $2 off because of the voucher.
Total cost after voucher discount = $400 - $2 = $398

Now, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
Total cost before discount = 20 * $30 = $600

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
Discount amount = 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60

Total cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila.

Difference = Sheila's final price - Clara's final price
Difference = $540 - $398 = $142

The final numerical answer is $142."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - The sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats because they were half the total amount earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats.
   - So, the total sales in the first month were \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales in two months:**
   - The total sales in two months were the sum of the sales in the first and second months.
   - So, the total sales in two months were \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
2100"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total.
2. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. The first hour is $15.
4. Each hour after that is twice the cost of the first hour, so the second hour is $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour is $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105."
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the amount she actually has in her bank account.

First, let's find out how much Sally earned this week. She started with $200 and now has $420. So, the amount she earned is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs in total. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, we calculate:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we can find the number of whole eggs needed by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the number of whole eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly rent for the hanger**: $5000
3. **Monthly cost for fuel**: Twice the rent, so $5000 * 2 = $10,000
4. **Total monthly cost**: Rent + Fuel = $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000
5. **Total cost for the first year**: Monthly cost * 12 months = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Now, let's add the cost of the plane to the total cost for the first year:

- Cost of the plane: $150,000
- Total cost for the first year: $180,000

Adding these together:

- Total cost: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, the time to cook pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. The time to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. So, the time to cook beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, we need to find the total time to cook all the food. We add the times for rice, beans, and pork:

\[30 + 50 + 40 = 120\]

So, the total time to cook all the food is 120 minutes. Let's confirm this with a final answer.

"To solve this problem, let's use some basic arithmetic and algebra.

First, let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, let's find the number of geese \( G \):
\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ S + G = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

"To solve this, let's add up the cost of the items Gus bought:

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- A bottle of soda: $1.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:

$20.00 (total spent) - $13.00 (cost of other items) = $7.00

Newspapers to District C = 209

Newspapers to District B = Total newspapers delivered - Newspapers to District A - Newspapers to District C

Let's do the math:

Newspapers to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

First, subtract the newspapers to District A from the total:

600 - 198 = 402

Then, subtract the newspapers to District C from the result:

402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we have the amounts of money each person has:
- Aurelia has $120.
- Kassidy has $90.
- Rayna has $150.

To find out how much money they would have if they added together their money and shared it equally, we first need to find the total amount of money they have together:

- In ""rabbit"" mode, 30 minutes is half of 40 minutes.

Adding these times together:
30 minutes (turtle mode) + 30 minutes (rabbit mode) = 60 minutes

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 60 minutes."
"First, let's add up the time it takes for John and Jack to get to the library and then to the fire station.

Time to library: 6 minutes
Time to fire station: 13 minutes

Total time spent: 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school.

To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late."
"To solve this, let's break down the costs:

- 1 kilo of apples costs $4.
- 2 kilos of bananas cost $2 per kilo, so 2 kilos cost 2 * $2 = $4.
- 2 kilos of oranges cost $3 per kilo, so 2 kilos cost 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Celinda bakes 30 x 2 = 60 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We have one set of twins and one set of triplets.
2. Let's say the age of one of the twins is \( T \).
3. The other twin is 7 years older, so their age is \( T + 7 \).
4. The age of one of the triplets is \( T \) (since we don't know the ages of the other two triplets, we assume the triplet's age is the same as the twin's age for simplicity).
5. The combined ages of the twins and the triplet are 44.

So, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:
\[ T + (T + 7) + T = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3T + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 3T = 37 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ T = \frac{37}{3} \approx 12.33 \]

Since we are dealing with ages, and typically ages are whole numbers, we need to check if 12.33 is a reasonable age. However, since the problem doesn't specify that the ages must be whole numbers, we can conclude that the age of one of the twins is approximately 12.33 years.

The final numerical answer is:
12.33"
"First, let's add up the time John needs to finish his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, let's find out how much time John has left for napping:

Time left for napping = Total time before dinner - Total homework time
Time left for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's find out how much Manolo spent on the lollipops and candies.

He bought five lollipops at $0.40 each, so the cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

He also bought four candies that cost $3.20 in total.

Now, we need to find the cost of one candy. Since four candies cost $3.20, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month and then calculate how many coins he will have after 10 years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. To find out how many coins Neil saves per month, we calculate:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{2 \times 20}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ coins}
\]

So, Neil saves 8 coins per month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person saves in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are:
\[
10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong saves in 10 years:
\[
20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins Neil saves in 10 years:
\[
8 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 960 \text{ coins}
\]

Finally, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil to find the combined total:
\[
2400 \text{ coins} + 960 \text{ coins} = 3360 \text{ coins}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3360}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[
2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, the vaccines cost $40.

Next, we need to find the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the heartworm check costs 60% of \( T \), which can be written as:

\[
0.60 \times T = \text{cost of heartworm check}
\]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[
T = 40 + \text{cost of heartworm check}
\]

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can write:

\[
0.60 \times T = \text{cost of heartworm check}
\]

Substituting \( T \) from the previous equation:

\[
0.60 \times (40 + \text{cost of heartworm check}) = \text{cost of heartworm check}
\]

Let's denote the cost of the heartworm check by \( H \). Then:

\[
0.60 \times (40 + H) = H
\]

Expanding and solving for \( H \):

\[
24 + 0.60H = H
\]

Subtract \( 0.60H \) from both sides:

\[
24 = 0.40H
\]

Divide both sides by 0.40:

\[
H = \frac{24}{0.40} = 60
\]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60.

Now, we can find the total bill \( T \):

\[
T = 40 + 60 = 100
\]

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[
125 - 100 = 25
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:

- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- One orange costs three times as much as one banana, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for one crate of fruit, which contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges:

- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits in the crate:

\[
5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0
\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."
"To find out the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to first determine the number of each colored square and then calculate the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Blue squares are 4 more than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Green squares are 6 more than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - White squares are 12 fewer than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares:
- Total number of squares = Red squares + Blue squares + Green squares + White squares
- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square covers 1 square foot.

Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
- Total area = 68 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's figure out how many chairs Mia currently has. We know that there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, Mia currently has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, which totals to:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, we need to find out how many chairs Mia needs to accommodate 42 adults and 15 babies. So, the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the number of chairs needed:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of the 40% used by Colorado City, 80% is used for industrial purposes. This means 20% of the total river water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City (since 40% * 80% = 32% of the total river water is used for industrial purposes, but we need to subtract the 16% already accounted for in the 40% used by Colorado City, leaving 20%).

So, the remaining 20% of the 40% used by Colorado City is for non-industrial purposes. This means 20% of 40% is 8% of the total river water.

Therefore, the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham:

- Total calories = calories from eggs + calories from cheese + calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories
- Total calories = 770 calories

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is 770 calories."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers.

A pencil costs $0.50, so 6 pencils cost:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

An eraser costs $0.25, so 8 erasers cost:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and erasers to find the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the pencils and erasers. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 people receive interviews, we have:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 30 people receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Now, we need to determine how many of these 6 people accept the position. Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, 2 people accept the position.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Goldy gave away a total of 3 + 4 = 7 sacks of rice.

"To solve this, let's first figure out how many boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week.

This week, she bought:
- 3 boxes of Coco Crunch
- 5 boxes of Fruit Loops

So, the total number of boxes she bought this week is:
3 + 5 = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number she bought this week:
8 - 4 = 4 boxes

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes in the 5 minutes, considering the different tap rates when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's determine the number of taps per minute when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are at her sides is:
\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Next, let's determine the number of taps per minute when her arms are raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

So, the total number of taps per minute when her arms are raised is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of taps for the 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and at her sides for 3 minutes.

For the 3 minutes when her arms are at her sides:
\[ 3 \text{ minutes} \times 550 \text{ taps per minute} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

For the 2 minutes when her arms are raised:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \times 400 \text{ taps per minute} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of taps:
\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

So, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Damage to the car if not fixed:** $450
2. **Fine if Ron fixes it himself:** $120
3. **Cost of asphalt:** 3 buckets at $25 each

First, calculate the total cost of the asphalt:
\[ 3 \text{ buckets} \times \$25 \text{ per bucket} = \$75 \]

Now, add the fine to the cost of the asphalt to find the total cost if Ron fixes it himself:
\[ \$120 \text{ (fine)} + \$75 \text{ (asphalt)} = \$195 \]

Next, compare this total cost to the damage to the car if it's not fixed:
\[ \$195 \text{ (total cost if fixed)} - \$450 \text{ (damage if not fixed)} = -\$255 \]

Since the negative value indicates a savings, Ron saves:
\[ \$255 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chairs initially:

- Normal chairs: 170
- Baby chairs: 23

Total chairs initially = 170 + 23 = 193 chairs

Next, we need to find out how many chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair:

- Normal chairs sent: 20
- Baby chairs sent: 13

Total chairs sent for repair = 20 + 13 = 33 chairs

Now, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially:

Chairs left = Total chairs initially - Total chairs sent for repair
Chairs left = 193 - 33 = 160 chairs

So, the final number of chairs left in the restaurant is 160."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends), they ordered 5 pizzas. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each of them had one pizza, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left(12 \times \frac{2}{3}\right) = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. Since each of them had one pizza, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left(12 \times \frac{3}{4}\right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all four friends, we get:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the cat's time, so:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. The average time is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoes are 8-feet and 4-inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the remaining inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoes are 100 inches long.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. Let's confirm this by checking the original condition:

\[ 9 \times 10 + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The condition is satisfied, so the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars and teachers' cars.

For the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\) windows.

Next, we calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.

For the students' cars:
- She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
- A quarter of 256 windows is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64\) windows.

For the teachers' cars:
- She smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
- Three-quarters of 64 windows is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48\) windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both types of cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 (students) + 48 (teachers) = 112 windows.

So, the final numerical answer is:
112"
"To solve this, we need to find the total number of spools and the number of blue spools, then calculate the percentage of blue spools.

First, let's add up all the spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Now, let's find the total number of blue spools:
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light blue spools: 15

Total blue spools = 45 + 15 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"First, let's find out how many people had voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by midday is:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people after midday are 3000, so:

\[ \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate how many pieces of gum he will chew in total over those 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. So, for 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of gum he will need. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

Each kid wants 2 smores and there are 9 kids:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

Each adult wants 1 smore and there are 6 adults:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Now, add the smores needed for the kids and the adults:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. Each sleeve makes 8 smores:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, they will need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87

- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice as much as her English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (History)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B got. Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B's votes = Candidate A's votes + 50% of Candidate A's votes
Candidate B's votes = 20 + 0.50 * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. So, the votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total votes.

Votes for candidate C = Total votes - (Votes for candidate A + Votes for candidate B)
Votes for candidate C = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 votes

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after Boris gives 10 apples to Beck:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 50 students in total.
2. 10 students like to bake.
3. 5 students like to play basketball.
4. The rest like to play video games or play music.

First, we need to find out how many students like to play music. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. So, if 5 students like to play basketball, then the number of students who like to play music is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

Now, we can find out how many students like to play video games. We know the total number of students is 50. So, the number of students who like to play video games is the total number of students minus the number who like to bake, minus the number who like to play basketball, and minus the number who like to play music.

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25\]

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

This means that if the activity is divided into 12 groups, each group would have 4.5 students. However, since we can't have half a student in a group, this division isn't practical in a real-world scenario, but we can still answer the question based on the given numbers.

The question asks how many more groups are needed to form if the activity is to be divided into 12 groups. Since the activity is already divided into 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to reach 12 groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

6"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends over two 4-week months.

First, let's determine the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends in one 4-week month:
- Chairs rented during weekdays: \(20 \times 60 = 1200\)
- Chairs rented during weekends: \(8 \times 100 = 800\)

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[ 1200 + 800 = 2000 \]

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[ 2000 \times 2 = 4000 \]

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Arnold stole 12 bananas from the pile:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

\[
\boxed{43}

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the yearly cost per roommate.

First, we know the monthly cost for electricity is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find out how much each roommate pays each month:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, to find out how much each roommate pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ \text{Yearly cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses
- 4 dozen plates

Since 1 dozen equals 12 items, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

Total glasses = 8 dozen * 12 glasses/dozen = 96 glasses
Total plates = 4 dozen * 12 plates/dozen = 48 plates

Next, we need to account for the broken items:
- 10 glasses were broken
- 6 plates were broken

Now, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:

Remaining glasses = 96 glasses - 10 broken glasses = 86 glasses
Remaining plates = 48 plates - 6 broken plates = 42 plates

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

So, the final numerical answer is:
128"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button is worth one small sticker, so she gets 27 small stickers in return for the 27 small buttons.
   - After trading, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, each large sticker is worth 1 large button.
   - So, she gets 20 large buttons in return for the 20 large stickers.
   - After trading, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left and 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.
   - The remaining large stickers are 20.
   - Each large sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 20 small buttons in return for the 20 large stickers.
   - After trading, she has 20 small stickers left and 20 large buttons.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - She has 20 large buttons and 20 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth three small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - Adding the small buttons she already has, she has 60 + 20 = 80 small buttons.
   - Since each small button is worth one small sticker, she has 80 small buttons, which is equivalent to 80 small stickers.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons she has by the end is 20 large buttons + 80 small buttons = 100 buttons.

The final numerical answer is:
100"

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, let's add up all the matches he played in one week:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

Total matches = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so it is \( 2x \).
3. The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
4. We know the total number of people on the council is 33, so \( 3x = 33 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3: \( x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \).
6. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we add up all the students to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

- Total shirts = XS + S + M + L + XL
- Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15

Let's add these numbers:

11 + 22 = 33
33 + 18 = 51
51 + 9 = 60
60 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Original price} \times \frac{\text{Discount percentage}}{100}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7

"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 people are left.

Now, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win.

60% of 40 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, 16 people think horse #12 will win.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one third of Jana's Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 is one third of the Pomeranian puppies, then the total number of Pomeranian puppies is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. So, if 18 is two thirds of the total number of puppies, then the total number of puppies is \(18 \div \frac{2}{3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27\).

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

Now, we know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

Multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs \( x \) cases, which is 100 cases.

The number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To solve this, let's break down Tanya's earnings for each day.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns 5 * $15 = $75.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5 per day.
- So, for Monday, she earns $75 + $5 = $80.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns 2 * $15 = $30.
- Since she teaches less than or equal to 3 classes, she doesn't get the additional $5 per day.
- So, for Wednesday, she earns $30.

"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much time Tatiana has in total for the weekend:
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
Total weekend time = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, we know that Tatiana spends 3 hours reading. So, we subtract the time spent reading from the total weekend time:
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
Time spent playing video games = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

We now subtract the time spent playing video games from the remaining time:
Time left after playing video games = 9 - 3 = 6 hours

This remaining time is the time she spends playing soccer. So, the time spent playing soccer is 6 hours.

To find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Driving:**
   - They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 miles/hour * 6 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Hiking:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour.
   - So, their hiking speed is 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.
   - Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

3. **Total Distance:**

"Let's break down the points for each player based on the information given.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T \) be the time Emma finishes the level in seconds.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so Ava finishes the level in \( T + 4 \) seconds.

Now, let's calculate the points for each player:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times (E + 8) \) for Ava and \( 10 \times E \) for Emma.
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times (B + 3) \) for Ava and \( 5 \times B \) for Emma.
- Points for time: \( 30 \times (T + 4) \) for Ava and \( 30 \times T \) for Emma.

The difference in points between Ava and Emma is:
\[ 10 \times (E + 8) + 5 \times (B + 3) + 30 \times (T + 4) - (10 \times E + 5 \times B + 30 \times T) \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 - 10E - 5B - 30T \]
\[ = 80 + 15 + 120 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Four Pizzas**: The total cost of four pizzas is $64.

2. **Cost of Two Pizzas**: Two of the pizzas cost $30 each.

3. **Total Cost of Two Known Pizzas**: 
   \[
   30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining Cost for Two Pizzas**: Subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost to find the cost of the other two pizzas.
   \[
   64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Each of the Other Two Pizzas**: Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, divide the remaining cost by 2.
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Biking Frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day on 5 days.
   - On 2 other days, they ride twice as much as they do on the usual days.

2. **Calculate Biking on 5 Days:**
   - They ride 3 times a day.
   - So, in 5 days, they ride \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) times.

3. **Calculate Biking on 2 Days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice as much as 3 times a day.
   - Twice 3 times a day is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) times a day.
   - So, in 2 days, they ride \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) times.

4. **Total Biking in a Week:**
   - Add the biking from the 5 days and the 2 days.
   - Total biking in a week is \( 15 + 12 = 27 \) times.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He got 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding the 17 fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

So, the total number of fish he added is \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the 17 fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

Now substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the first equation:
\[ (5 + 2W) + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. Let's check if this solution is correct by finding the number of orange fish he bought:
\[ O = 5 + 2W = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13 \]

Now, let's verify the condition:
- Total fish after adding: \( 7 + 17 = 24 \)
- Number of orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- Number of white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Check if orange fish are twice the white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \)

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance is 5 miles.
   - So, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - For 5 days, the total distance is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of gas Andy consumes in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - So, the amount of gas he consumes for 50 miles is \(50 \text{ miles} \div 10 \text{ miles/gallon} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the gas Andy consumes in a week:**
   - The price of gas is $3 per gallon.
   - So, the cost for 5 gallons is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming **15 dollars** per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she has 10 twenties:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find out how much she spent on the twenties, we calculate 3/5 of $200:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money she paid for the lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

Next, let's calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, we can find out how many OLED TVs were sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Smart TVs} + \text{Analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."

"First, let's determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. 

Given:
- Daytime temperature: 45 degrees
- Nighttime temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The temperature at night is 12 degrees, which is below the freezing point of 32 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The temperature difference needed to raise the night temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the total temperature needed by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.

To solve for \( x \), we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve this, let's break down the information Dale has:

1. Dale initially had 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies.
3. He then ordered 100 more candies.

First, let's calculate how many candies Dale has after selling 150:

100 (initial candies) - 150 (sold) = -50

Since he can't have a negative number of candies, this means he ran out of candies and needed to order more. So, he ordered 100 more candies to make up for the shortage.

Now, let's add the 100 candies he ordered to the 50 he had left after selling:

-50 (left after selling) + 100 (ordered) = 50

So, Dale has 50 candies left to sell.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.
2. By the end of the first month, the number of students doubles, so there are \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students.
3. By the end of the second month, the number of students doubles again, so there are \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students.
4. By the end of the third month, the number of students doubles again, so there are \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students.
5. By the end of the fourth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students.
6. By the end of the fifth month, the number of students doubles again, so there are \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students.

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year. 

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and at the end of May, there are 320 students. So, the number of additional students is \(320 - 10 = 310\).

The final numerical answer is:
310"
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many branches Felix climbed in total and then divide that by the number of days he worked.

Felix made $105 in total. Since each branch costs $.25, we can find out how many branches he climbed by dividing the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Number of branches} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} \]

\[ \text{Number of branches} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Now, we need to know how many days he worked to make $105. Since the question doesn't specify the number of days, we'll assume he worked for the entire week (7 days) to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \text{ branches per day} \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

1. First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she picks:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 flower from each of the 4 types she picked, so she drops:
\[
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ flowers}
\]

The total number of petals of the flowers she drops is:
\[
(1 \times 5) + (1 \times 6) + (1 \times 4) + (1 \times 7) = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
\]

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals she picked:
\[
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores.

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores. So together they make:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

They started with 35 marshmallows and dropped 3 on the ground. So the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the remaining 32 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make:
\[ 32 \text{ S'mores} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 32 S'mores between John and DeSean. Since they made 18 S'mores together, they have 14 S'mores left to make (32 - 18 = 14).

If we assume they split the remaining S'mores equally, each would get:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem and figure out how long each person can play the game.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 20 / 2 = 10 minutes with one quarter.
One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes with one quarter.

Now, let's calculate the total time they play together:
Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
The two friends who can play for 10 minutes each play for 2 * 10 = 20 minutes.
The friend who can play for 30 minutes plays for 30 minutes.

So, the total time they play is 240 + 20 + 30 = 290 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many quarters they use. Since each quarter allows for 20 minutes of play, we divide the total play time by 20:
290 / 20 = 14.5 quarters.

Since they can't use half a quarter, they will need to use 15 quarters in total.

So, the final numerical answer is:
15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount of salt Tanya uses as \( S \) ounces.
2. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil she uses is \( 2S \) ounces.
3. She uses the same amount of fragrance as citrus zest, so let's denote the amount of fragrance and citrus zest as \( F \) ounces each.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of zest is \( \frac{S}{2} \) ounces.
5. The total amount of ingredients in the jar is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
   \[
   S + 2S + F + F + \frac{S}{2} = 10
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   S + 2S + \frac{S}{2} + F + F = 10
   \]
   \[
   3S + \frac{S}{2} + 2F = 10
   \]
   To combine the terms involving \( S \), we can rewrite \( 3S + \frac{S}{2} \) as:
   \[
   \frac{6S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} = \frac{7S}{2}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{7S}{2} + 2F = 10
   \]
   Since \( F = \frac{S}{2} \), we can substitute \( F \) with \( \frac{S}{2} \):
   \[
   \frac{7S}{2} + 2 \left( \frac{S}{2} \right) = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7S}{2} + S = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7S + 2S}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{9S}{2} = 10
   \]
   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   9S = 20
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{9}
   \]
   Now, we need to find the amount of oil, which is \( 2S \):
   \[
   2S = 2 \left( \frac{20}{9} \right) = \frac{40}{9}
   \]
   So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{40}{9} \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{40}{9}}

"To solve this, let's break it down:

John buys 3 goats at $500 each, so:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

He also buys 2 cows at $1500 each, so:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the cost of the goats and cows together:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total.

The final numerical answer is:
$4500"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially:**
   - We know Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Determine how many cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he gave away and sold is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine how much money the students raised in total. We know the total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250."

So, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Cycles**: John does 30 cycles of work a day.
2. **Tasks per Cycle**: Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
3. **Payment per Task**: Each task pays $1.20.

First, we calculate how much John earns in one cycle:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Next, we calculate how much John earns in one day:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Finally, we calculate how much John earns in a full 7-day week:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we know PJ has 47 cards. Let's find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have.

Smendrick has \( 3P \):
\[ 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

Becca has \( 3P + 12 \):
\[ 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Amazon will refund. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refund amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

Now, we calculate how much money Milly will lose. This is the sum of the shipping cost and the difference between the book's purchase price and the refund amount:
\[ \$3.00 + (\$32 - \$24) = \$3.00 + \$8.00 = \$11.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

- Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
- In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars.
- In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
- In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: 4,000 bars
- Third week: 24,000 bars

Total for first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars each month, the production for the fourth week would be:

50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, the final numerical answer is 14,000 bars."
"To solve this, let's break down the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities each week and then multiply by 4 to get the monthly total.

1. **TikTok Videos:** Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
   \[
   18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we need to understand that the total time it takes for the kangaroos to cross the highway is 18 hours. This means the total distance they travel is 18 hours times their speed.

2. If we assume each kangaroo travels at a speed of \( v \) (let's call this speed ""kangaroo speed""), then the total distance \( D \) they travel is:
   \[
   D = 3 \times v \times 18 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   D = 54v
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so each turtle's speed is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

4. The time \( T \) it takes for one turtle to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
   \[
   T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{54v \times 2}{v} = 108 \text{ hours}

"First, let's determine the final price of the new laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 now. We know that Erika has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Let's add these amounts to her current savings in her purse:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

So, if we let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:

\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples. Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:

\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ slices/apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples to find the total number of slices Adam has:

\[ 15 \text{ slices (from large apples)} + 15 \text{ slices (from small apples)} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:

"To solve this, let's first calculate how much milk the farmer gets from his 3 cows.

Each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows give:
\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows he needs, we first determine the difference in milk production needed:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Each additional cow can produce 5 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

"To solve this, we need to calculate how much of each glue stick is not used and then sum these amounts.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   - 1/6 of 12 millimeters = 12 * (1/6) = 2 millimeters are used.
   - So, 12 - 2 = 10 millimeters are not used.

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   - 2/3 of 12 millimeters = 12 * (2/3) = 8 millimeters are used.
   - So, 12 - 8 = 4 millimeters are not used.

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   - 1/2 of 12 millimeters = 12 * (1/2) = 6 millimeters are used.
   - So, 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters are not used.

Now, we add the unused lengths together:
- 10 millimeters + 4 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 20 millimeters

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so in total he has $5000 + $200 = $5200.

The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 * $20 = $80. The hat cost $70, so the change she got is $80 - $70 = $10.

"Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.

He buys six squirt guns for $2 each, so he spends 6 * 2 = 12 dollars on squirt guns.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so he spends 3 * 3 = 9 dollars on water balloons.

In total, Craig spends 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.

So, Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \(60 / 2 = 30\) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \(30 \times 2 = 60\) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \(60 / 2 = 30\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: Jack's socks + Peter's socks = \(30 + 60 = 90\)
- Total dishes: Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = \(60 + 30 = 90\)

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(90 + 90 = 180\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know that the total number of students is 20. We can subtract the number of students who are only good at math and only good at English from the total to find the number of students who are good at both.

So, the number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both those who are only good at math and those who are good at both math and English. So, the total number of students good at math is:
\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's break down the time each group takes and the total time available for the concert.

Each group takes:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, each group takes a total of \(2 + 6 + 2 = 10\) minutes.

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

There is also a 10-minute intermission.

So, the time available for the groups to perform is \(120 - 10 = 110\) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many groups can perform in 110 minutes. Since each group takes 10 minutes, we divide the available time by the time each group takes:

\[
\frac{110}{10} = 11
\]

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert.

The final numerical answer is 11."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the original amount and the interest rate:**
   - Original amount (principal, \( P \)) = $300
   - Interest rate per year = three-quarters of the original amount = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) percent per year

2. **Calculate the interest earned per year:**
   - Interest per year = \( 225\% \) of $300
   - Interest per year = \( 225 \times \frac{300}{100} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \) dollars

3. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**
   - Total interest over 3 years = \( 675 \times 3 = 2025 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   - Total amount = Original amount + Total interest
   - Total amount = \( 300 + 2025 = 2325 \) dollars

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is **$2325**."

"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. Since there are 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left.

So, the total number of goats left is \(45 + 25 = 70\).

The final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount he spends on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes he buys.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. A basket of green food costs $25.
2. A basket of red food costs $18.
3. If you buy 3 baskets of green food, you'll pay 3 * $25 = $75 for the green food.
4. If you buy 3 baskets of red food, you'll pay 3 * $18 = $54 for the red food.
5. For each basket of red food, you get $2 off. So, for 3 baskets of red food, you get 3 * $2 = $6 off.
6. So, the total cost for the red food after the discount is $54 - $6 = $48.
7. Now, add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food after the discount: $75 + $48 = $123.

So, the total amount you have to pay is $123."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many rooms are half of 90 rooms. Half of 90 is 45 rooms.

Now, if it takes 20 minutes to clean one room, then to clean 45 rooms, it would take 45 * 20 minutes.

Let's calculate that:
45 * 20 = 900 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
900 minutes ÷ 60 = 15 hours

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). So, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

So, the final numerical answer is 144."
"Let's denote the ages of the people as follows:
- Let \( S \) be your age.
- Your brother's age is \( S + 3 \).
- Your sister's age is \( S - 2 \).
- Your mom's age is \( 3(S + 3) - 1 \).

The sum of all their ages is given as 87. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 3) + (S - 2) + (3(S + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ S + S + 3 + S - 2 + 3S + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6S = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 13 \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy so that each of the 27 students can have 2 glue sticks, and we need to ensure there are some extra glue sticks left over.

First, let's calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks per pack}} = 6.75 \text{ packs} \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

To ensure there are some extra glue sticks left over, we can check the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks per pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since 56 glue sticks is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks.

Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

   - Therefore, the amount of water on the second day is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Amount of Water After the Second Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 10 infected people.

**Day 1:**
Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
So, the number of new infections on Day 1 is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
The total number of infected people after Day 1 is \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
Now there are 70 infected people. Each of these 70 people infects 6 others.
So, the number of new infections on Day 2 is \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
The total number of infected people after Day 2 is \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
Now there are 490 infected people. Each of these 490 people infects 6 others.
So, the number of new infections on Day 3 is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
The total number of infected people after Day 3 is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can find the total amount by multiplying the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[
40 \text{ customers} \times 20 \text{ dollars/customer} = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ dollars} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 \text{ dollars} - 80 \text{ dollars} = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the combined total:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire takes 1 month to earn 1 badge, Amber takes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) months to earn 1 badge.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \) badge every month.
   - In a year, Amber earns \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Claire earns 12 badges in a year.
   - Therefore, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned by Wendy and Amber:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges.
   - Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Paige bakes banana bread. She starts at 1:00 PM and stops at 6:00 PM, so she bakes for 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she can bake in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, we multiply the number of hours by the number of loaves per hour:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ loaves/hour} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so we calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so we calculate the total revenue from selling all the slices:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cents to dollars:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins.
2. We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), then the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).
3. Since we know the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   S + 30 = 70
   \]
4. To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 70 - 30 = 40
   \]
5. Now we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

   \[
   \text{Total burritos given to students} = 50 \times 10 = 500
   \]

5. **Burritos Eaten by Mr. George**: Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

6. **Total Burritos Eaten**: 
   \[
   \text{Total burritos eaten} = \text{Burritos given to students} + \text{Burritos eaten by Mr. George}

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2
Number of green cars = 10

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars:

Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 * 10
Number of blue cars = 30

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find out how many yellow cars there are by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - (Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30)
Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52
Number of yellow cars = 23

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know the total number of books they have together is 85. So we can write the equation:

\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's check the answer:

- Fawn has 28 books.
- Anne has \( 28 - 12 = 16 \) books.
- Sofie has \( 16 + 25 = 41 \) books.

Adding these up: \( 28 + 16 + 41 = 85 \), which matches the total number of books.

Therefore, the final answer is:

2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so:
\[ 16 \text{ bolts} \times \$0.03 \text{ per bolt} = \$0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:
\[ \$12.48 - \$0.48 = \$12.00 \]

So, the amount of money David has left after buying the bolts is:
\[ \$12.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate. We know that she earned $33 for 3 hours of work. So, we can calculate her hourly rate by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours she worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now that we know her hourly rate is $11 per hour, we can calculate how much she would earn in 12 hours by multiplying her hourly rate by 12:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles.

Paul starts with 52 marbles and his friend gives him 28 more marbles:
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate 1/4 of 80:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total he had after his friend gave him more marbles:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, Paul has 60 marbles left."

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
\]

Next, we know that he plans to sell each chicken for $50. To find out the total amount of money he will make from selling these 180 chickens, we multiply the number of chickens by the price per chicken.

\[
\text{Total money from selling} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. To find out how much money he spent on the chickens, we subtract the profit from the total money he will make.

\[
\text{Money spent on chickens} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is $7000."
"Micah sold the same number of glasses as Mitchell. First, we need to find out how many glasses Mitchell sold. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total number of glasses sold is 32, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses Mitchell and Micah sold together:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Mitchell and Micah sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the remaining glasses equally between them:

18 ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling her 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of rope she can buy, we divide the money she has by the cost per meter:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} \div 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = \frac{40}{1.5} \text{ meters} \]

To simplify \(\frac{40}{1.5}\):

\[ \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 10}{1.5 \times 10} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of rope, she can buy 26 meters of rope.

Next, we calculate the cost of 26 meters of rope at $1.5 per meter:

\[ 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah has:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the final amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for her age being thrice her current age:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be thrice her current age.
   - In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).
   - We want this age to be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 24 - 8

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}

     \]

4. **Relate the length of the final concert to her usual concerts:**
   - The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
   - Let \( x \) be the length of her usual concerts.
   - According to the problem, the final concert is twice the length of her usual concerts:
     \[
     2x = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, let's find out how many microphones won't fit in pairs. We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit. So, we calculate 20% of 50 microphones:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs. This means the remaining microphones that can fit in pairs are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's break down the information given:

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, so:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

Now, we can find out how many plants are flowering plants by subtracting the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find what percent of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percent of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins first. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of thingamabob = Speed of whatchamacallit / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 121 meters per second / 11
Speed of thingamabob = 11 meters per second

Now that we know the speed of a thingamabob, we can find out how fast a whirligig spins. We know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
Speed of whirligig = 11 meters per second * 5
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent $216 in total for these 27 tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, let's break down the information given:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Dog walking: 1 hour

Total time spent on these activities is \(10 + 8 + 1 = 19\) hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is \(24 - 19 = 5\) hours.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes. He has 9 red shoe boxes, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]
So, he uses 3 red shoe boxes.

Now, let's calculate how many blue shoe boxes are left:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]
So, 4 blue shoe boxes are left.

And let's calculate how many red shoe boxes are left:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]
So, 6 red shoe boxes are left.

The final answer is:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Duncan's current age**: Duncan is 60 years old now.

2. **Duncan's age eight years ago**: 
   \[
   60 - 8 = 52 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Adam's age four years ago**: Let Adam's age four years ago be \( x \).

4. **Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago**:
   \[
   52 = 2x
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{52}{2} = 26
   \]

   So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago.

6. **Adam's current age**:
   \[
   26 + 4 = 30 \text{ years old}
   \]

7. **Adam's age in 8 years**:
   \[
   30 + 8 = 38 \text{ years old}
   \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 200 * 2 = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, so it's 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, to find out how many acres the two farms have together, we add the sizes of both farms:

200 acres (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 acres (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

So, the two farms have 700 acres together."
"First, let's figure out how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby completes 320 packages in an eight-hour workday.

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns. He gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. So we multiply the number of packages by the amount he gets paid per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time to solve a normal Sudoku:**
   - John takes 45 minutes to solve a normal Sudoku.

2. **Time to solve an extreme Sudoku:**
   - An extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal Sudoku.
   - Therefore, the time to solve an extreme Sudoku is \( 45 \times 4 = 180 \) minutes.

3. **Total time spent on solving Sudokus:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time spent on both types of Sudokus.
   - Total time = 45 minutes (normal Sudoku) + 180 minutes (extreme Sudoku) = 225 minutes.

4. **Number of bottles of water John drinks:**
   - John drinks one bottle of water every half hour.
   - To find out how many bottles he drinks in 225 minutes, we need to convert the total time into half-hour intervals.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 225 minutes, there are \( \frac{225}{30} = 7.5 \) half-hour intervals.
   - Since John drinks one bottle of water per half hour, he drinks 7.5 bottles of water.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
7.5"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at. We know the following:

- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There were 20 red balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of bologna used on the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, we subtract the number of pieces of bologna used on the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find out how many pieces were used on the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces of bologna} - 40 \text{ pieces of bologna for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna for yellow balloons} \]

Now, we need to determine how many yellow balloons were used with these 18 pieces of bologna. Since each yellow balloon requires 3 pieces of bologna:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces of bologna}}{3 \text{ pieces of bologna per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Let's break down the hours Bruce works each day:

- On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours for all three days:
5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is 23."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of balloons**: 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. **Cost of ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14

Total cost: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Because they split the money equally, we need to divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each one received.

So, each one received: $28 / 2 = $14

The final numerical answer is:
14"
"Kira bought 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, so there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, we need to find the total number of students playing in all groups. We add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer:

- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by all the students.

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students.

Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops.

Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.

Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.

Each lollypop cost $0.5 to buy.

Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

So, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets Larry has:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total cups of tea**: Lana has 27 cups of tea.
2. **Rows of tea cups**: She divides these cups into 3 rows.
3. **Equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row**: Let's assume each row has \( x \) cups of chamomile tea and \( x \) cups of mint tea. So, each row has \( 2x \) cups of tea in total.
4. **Total cups of cinnamon tea**: She uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups of tea are in each row. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups in the rows is \( 3 \times 2x = 6x \). The remaining cups are used for cinnamon tea, which is 15 cups. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 6x + 15 = 27 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 6x = 27 - 15 \]
\[ 6x = 12 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each row has \( 2 \) cups of chamomile tea and \( 2 \) cups of mint tea, making a total of \( 4 \) cups of tea per row.

The number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( 2 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to go down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in that time.

The total time available is 8 hours, and each trip takes 4 hours. Therefore, the number of trips he can make in 8 hours is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many berries he can pick up per trip. Since he needs to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's find out how much water is in the tank. The pool has 10000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount.

Half of 10000 gallons is:
\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the tank has 5000 gallons of water.

Next, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

In 6 days, the amount of water used is:
\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:
\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:
\[ 2000 \]

Final numerical answer:

2. **Cost of a popcorn and a box of candy:**
   - Popcorn: $8
   - Candy: $2
   - Total for one popcorn and candy: $8 + $2 = $10

3. **Colby's total money:**
   - $150

4. **Colby's expenses:**
   - He already spent $10 on popcorn and candy.
   - He has 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy left, but we don't need to calculate the cost of these as we are only concerned with the money he has left to spend on tickets.

5. **Money left for tickets:**
   - $150 - $10 = $140

6. **Number of tickets he can buy:**
   - Since each ticket costs $10, he can buy $140 / $10 = 14 tickets.

7. **Movies already seen:**
   - 5 movies on Friday or Saturday
   - 8 movies on other days
   - Total movies already seen: 5 + 8 = 13 movies

8. **Movies he can still see:**
   - Total tickets he can buy: 14
   - Movies already seen: 13
   - Movies he can still see: 14 - 13 = 1 movie

"First, let's find out the calories for mini versions of the pastries.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- So, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- So, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories.
- So, the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls is \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- Each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.
- So, the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins is \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Finally, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories = calories from mini cinnamon rolls + calories from mini blueberry muffins
- Total calories = 40000 + 45000 = 85000 calories.

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day, we need to first calculate the total number of Junebugs she picked over the five days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

- On Monday, she picked 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Wednesday, she also picked twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs picked over the five days:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the numbers step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs picked over the five days is 299.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs picked per day. There are 5 days in total, so we divide the total number of Junebugs by 5:

\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day is:

\[
\boxed{59.8}

"First, let's calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the bus} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance of the car} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie already has and then subtract that total from the number of toys she has now.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

So, the total number of toys Sophie already has is:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys for her nephew.

To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she already has from the total number of toys:
62 (total toys) - 48 (toys already counted) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, Peter's age is:

"First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney. To do this, we add the total distances and divide by the number of people (which is 2):
\[ \text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a month and then find out how much money Fern can make from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can make in a day:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes:
  \[
  60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}
  \]
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. In 24 hours, it makes:
  \[
  45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can make in a month (30 days):
- Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
  \[
  1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets}
  \]
- WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
  \[
  1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total money each machine can make by selling the widgets at $6 each:
- Widgeteer 3000:
  \[
  43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- WidgetMaster 9000:
  \[
  32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars}

Cameron wants to stay for 18 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning). He decides to pay for the 12-hour stay and then add the extra 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark.

Here's the calculation:

- **12-hour stay**: 1000 pesos
- **Extra hours**: 18 - 12 = 6 hours
- **Extra cost**: 6 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 420 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 420 \text{ pesos} = 1420 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's compare this to the 24-hour stay option:
- **24-hour stay**: 1600 pesos

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the total cost of the 18-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1420 \text{ pesos} = 180 \text{ pesos} \]

So, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{180} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate twice the amount each goat needs:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we subtract 3 pounds from this amount to find out how much each sheep needs:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that each goat needs 5 pounds and each sheep needs 7 pounds. We need to calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep separately and then sum them up.

For the goats:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

For the sheep:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay needed:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 159 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money he spent on gas. He spent 50 dollars on gas, so:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John wants to buy 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother. We add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and the total number of letters spelled out by his brother:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of children in the drill. Here's how we can break it down:

1. First, we need to find out how many children are in one row. According to the problem, there are 8 children in each row.
2. Next, we need to find out how many rows there are. The problem states there are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools. So, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 5 = 35\).
3. Now, to find the total number of children, we multiply the number of children in one row by the total number of rows. So, the total number of children is \(8 \times 35\).

Let's calculate \(8 \times 35\):

\[8 \times 35 = 8 \times (30 + 5) = (8 \times 30) + (8 \times 5) = 240 + 40 = 280\]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280. Let's confirm this with a final answer.

The final numerical answer is:
\[280\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[
9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[
29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[
900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
\]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To calculate how much Patty's Plumbing charged, we need to add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the parts cost.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.
3. The parts cost is $60.

Now, we add these amounts together:

$40 (visit fee) + $78.75 (labor cost) + $60 (parts cost) = $178.75

So, Patty's Plumbing charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.

\[
10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
\]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price.

\[
60\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.60 \times \$150 = \$90
\]

So, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.

James decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40. We need to calculate the total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs.

\[
5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
\]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out. He initially paid $90 for the 10 CDs, but he got $200 from selling 5 of them. We subtract the amount he paid from the amount he received.

\[
\$200 - \$90 = \$110
\]

So, James was out $110."
"First, let's calculate the earnings from each type of root crop Jen has:

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam can be sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. **Sweet potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato can be sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot can be sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, let's add up the earnings from all the root crops:

- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, Jen will earn **$34** if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the time taken for each part of the journey.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the speed he did initially, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   Add the time taken to swim, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then add them together.

For the New York Times:
- He sells 6 copies.
- Each copy costs $5.
- His commission is 10% on each copy.

First, calculate the total cost for the New York Times:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} = \$30 \]

Next, calculate the commission on the New York Times:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30 = 0.10 \times \$30 = \$3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- He sells 10 copies.
- Each copy costs $15.
- His commission is 8% on each copy.

First, calculate the total cost for the Wall Street Journal:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} = \$150 \]

Next, calculate the commission on the Wall Street Journal:
\[ 8\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.08 \times \$150 = \$12 \]

Now, add the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

So, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Dinar scored \( D \) points.
2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Bahati scored \( D + 10 \) points.
3. Bahati also scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Azibo scored \( (D + 10) - 20 = D - 10 \) points.

Now, we know the total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 10) + (D - 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ D + D + 10 + D - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3D = 45 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, Dinar scored 15 points. Now we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

\[ \text{Azibo's points} = D - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. Let's confirm this by checking the total points:

\[ \text{Bahati's points} = D + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25 \]
\[ \text{Azibo's points} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Dinar's points} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Total points} = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

The total is correct, so the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the thickness of the book relates to the number of pages. We know that the book is 1.5 inches thick and that each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages of stacked paper. Since each page is printed on both sides, the thickness of the book is the thickness of 100 pages of paper.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the thickness of the book in inches by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total number of pages} = 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} \]

\[ \text{Total number of pages} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Now, let's convert the hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 hours is:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide 900 by 15:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

So, the final numerical answer is 1800 reports."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
2. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.

Now, let's calculate the total time she was asleep on the bed:

- From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes.
- From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.
- She woke up at 5:55 a.m., which means she was not on the bed after 2:38 a.m.

So, the total time she was on the bed is:
4 hours and 15 minutes + 23 minutes = 4 hours and 38 minutes.

To convert this into minutes:
4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
240 minutes + 38 minutes = 278 minutes

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 278 minutes."
"First, let's determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]

Let's box the final answer:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's find out how many beds are occupied and how many are unoccupied in the hospital initially.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

This means the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day. So, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the number of patients admitted:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (which is 9 emails) are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we subtract the number of emails to family from the total non-work emails to find out how many emails are left:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

"To find out how many people really attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number of people Courtney reported and then subtract that from the number she reported.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly said Courtney had overstated the number by 20%. So, we need to find 20% of 48.

20% of 48 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

This means Courtney overstated the number by 9.6 people. To find the actual number of people, we subtract this from the number Courtney reported:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and typically in such contexts, we would round to the nearest whole number, but the problem doesn't specify rounding, so we can leave it as 38.4.

However, if we need to provide a whole number, we can round 38.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

So, the number of people who really attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jason carried 2 balls. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, we can calculate the number of balls each boy carried:

- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.
- Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason, so Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

Now, we add up the number of balls carried by all three boys to find the total number of balls:

\[ \text{Total number of balls} = \text{Jason's balls} + \text{Jordan's balls} + \text{Jeffrey's balls} = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 \]

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.
4. By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\) holes.
5. By the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes dug is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes.
6. The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total holes by the end of the fourth day and the total holes by the end of the third day, which is \(40 - 29 = 11\) holes.

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is 11.

"First, let's find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Adding this to the cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. Let's verify the solution:

- Adelwolfe caught \( A = 40 \) Pokemon.
- Stan caught \( S = 147 \) Pokemon.
- Alex caught \( X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152 \) Pokemon.

Check the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}

If each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, then John will spend 20 * 10 = 200 minutes watching the show.

The final numerical answer is 200."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in each leg of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three legs to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}

"To solve this, let's break down the number of brownies Greta had at each step:

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
2. At her office, she got 1/2 dozen brownies.
3. At her friends' surprise party, she got 4 dozen brownies.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

First, let's convert all the dozen numbers to individual brownies:
- 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- 4 dozen = 48 brownies
- 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta received:
- From herself: 1 dozen = 12 brownies
- From her office: 1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
- From her friends: 4 dozen = 48 brownies

Total brownies received:
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the brownies eaten during the party:
- Brownies eaten: 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Total brownies left:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is 48."
"First, let's find out the ages of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Nani's age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} \]
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

So, the total age of all three family members is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Andy will spend stringing all the racquets. We can do this by multiplying the number of racquets in each category by the time it takes to string them and then summing these times.

1. For synthetic gut strings:
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. For polyester strings:
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. For hybrid sets:
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we add up all the times:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys 1 phone for himself.
2. He buys 2 phones for his kids.
3. The third phone is half the price of the first one, so it costs $600 / 2 = $300.
4. The first two phones cost $600 each, so together they cost $600 + $600 = $1200.
5. Adding the third phone, which costs $300, the total cost is $1200 + $300 = $1500.

So, the final numerical answer is:
1500"
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. Combined, both teams have 13 + 20 = 33 players.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of wooden slats Robert will need for his fence.

First, let's find the total length of the fence. The fence is rectangular and has a length of 15 feet and a width of 10 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total wooden slats} = \text{Perimeter} \times 2 = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:
- She bought 12 boxes of oranges.

Next, we determine how many boxes she gave away:
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- Total boxes given away: \(2 + 2 = 4\) boxes.

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:
- Boxes kept: \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes that is:
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 12 boxes: \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) boxes.

So, she kept 3 boxes and sold the rest:
- Boxes sold: \(12 - 3 = 9\) boxes.

Each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges sold is:
- \( 9 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 180 \text{ oranges} \).

The final numerical answer is:
180"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of states in the USA:**
   - The USA has 50 states.

2. **Calculate half the number of states in the USA:**
   - Half of 50 states is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) states.

3. **Determine the number of states in India:**
   - India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
   - So, India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.

4. **Calculate the total number of states in both countries:**
   - USA has 50 states.
   - India has 29 states.
   - Total number of states = 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79 states.

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. So, the amount he still needs to buy the books is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's figure out how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. Richard has 20, Robert has 30, and we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. So, the number of cherries Jerry has is 60 - 20 - 30 = 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: 30 - 10 = 20.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on each day.

### Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

### Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

### Total Gingerbread Sold:
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

### Total Apple Pie Sold:
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of baked good.

### Earnings from Gingerbread:
- Cost per box: $6
- Total boxes sold: 25
- Total earnings: 25 * $6 = $150

### Earnings from Apple Pie:
- Cost per box: $15
- Total boxes sold: 21
- Total earnings: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

### Total Earnings:
- Gingerbread earnings: $150
- Apple pie earnings: $315
- Total: $150 + $315 = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of $465 for the two days."
"First, let's calculate how much sunscreen Pamela will use in one day. She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and she's outside for 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:

\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much sunscreen she will use over 8 days:

\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen she will need to pack. Since each bottle contains 8 ounces, we divide the total ounces she needs by the number of ounces per bottle:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so it costs 60% of the blue car's price. 

To find the price of the red car, we calculate 60% of $100:
\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 24 years old.
3. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will also be twice as old as his brother. So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, we need to find out the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother. Since Emil is currently 19 years old and he will be 24 in 5 years, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old. His brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
50"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which means her friend gave her \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, to find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we add up all the beads she received:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

So, the total number of beads is \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\).

The final numerical answer is 90."
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. 

20% of 30 students are football players:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

So, there are 6 football players. 

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:
\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. 

Adding the football players to these students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"First, let's determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie wears size 25 boots.

Next, we need to find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people.

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots}}{2} \]

Substituting the sizes we have:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the flower bed is measured in feet and the growth of the flowers is in inches, we'll convert everything to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 12 inches = 12 / 12 = 1 foot

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long.

Each flower grows to be 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet

Pat already has 17 flowers, so she needs to add more plants to fill the flower bed. To find out how many more plants she needs, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between them:

111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she needs 45 more plants to fill the flower bed (because 44 plants would only fill 44 * 2.5 = 110 feet, leaving 1 foot empty).

Now, we calculate the total cost. Pat needs 45 more plants, and each plant costs $6:

45 plants * $6/plant = $270

So, Pat will spend $270 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, let's find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

"To solve this, let's calculate the cost for one basket first and then multiply by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- Petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- Sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

Total cost for one basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Now, for 5 baskets:
- Total cost = 5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds for the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of remaining soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for fancy shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has for shoes in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Each pair of fancy shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we divide her yearly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year."
"First, let's calculate how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate how long it takes her to saute 30 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we don't need to do any additional calculations for sauteing because we are only asked about the total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp, and we've already determined that peeling 90 shrimp takes 15 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling on low: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling on high: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: 6 degrees.
- Cooling on high: 12 degrees.
- Warming up: 4 degrees.

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Buford writes:
- 1 check per month for the electric bill
- 1 check per month for the gas bill
- 2 checks per month for the church
- 1 check per year for the pest and lawn service

First, let's calculate the number of checks he writes per year for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check per month * 12 months = 12 checks
- Gas bill: 1 check per month * 12 months = 12 checks
- Church: 2 checks per month * 12 months = 24 checks
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check per year

Now, let's add them all up:
12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 1 (pest and lawn) = 51 checks

So, Buford writes 51 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The first plane makes 44 trips in total (since 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes).
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the number of trips to Greece, France, and Germany:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so it goes to Greece \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) times.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\).
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

The final numerical answer is:
11"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Tobias's howl duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - We need to add up the howl durations of all three wolves.
   - Combined duration = Tobias's duration + Chikote's duration + Igneous's duration
   - Combined duration = \( 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, \( 120 \) seconds is \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his mother and father from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total age of the children:**
   The total age of the children is given as 20 years.

2. **Identify the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:**
   - Akbar is 3 years old.
   - Alessandro is 4 years old.

3. **Calculate the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:**
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7
   \]

4. **Determine the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:**
   Since the total age of all four children is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred by subtracting the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13
   \]

5. **Express Helene's age in terms of the average age of the group:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Let's denote the average age of the group by \( A \). Therefore, Helene's age is \( 2A \).

6. **Express the combined age of Helene and Wilfred in terms of \( A \):**
   Since the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13, we can write:
   \[
   2A + \text{Wilfred's age} = 13
   \]

7. **Determine the average age \( A \) of the group:**
   The average age \( A \) is the total age divided by the number of children:
   \[
   A = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

8. **Calculate Helene's age:**
   Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
   \[
   2A = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

9. **Find Wilfred's age:**
   Using the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
   \[
   10 + \text{Wilfred's age} = 13
   \]
   Solving for Wilfred's age:
   \[
   \text{Wilfred's age} = 13 - 10 = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how the watermelon is divided among the family members based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Division:**
   - There are 2 adults and 4 kids.
   - Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

2. **Assume the Total Watermelon is 1 Unit:**
   - Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \).
   - Then, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

3. **Calculate the Total Amount of Each Slice:**
   - There are 4 kids, so the total amount of slices for the kids is \( 4x \).
   - There are 2 adults, so the total amount of slices for the adults is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).

4. **Total Amount of Slices:**
   - The total amount of slices from the watermelon is \( 4x + 4x = 8x \).

5. **Percentage of the Watermelon Each Adult Gets:**
   - Each adult gets \( 2x \) out of the total \( 8x \).
   - The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
     \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities.

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic. We need to convert this time into minutes to make it easier to subtract from the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total clinic time to find out how much time Doctor Jones has left to update his records.

\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining time from minutes to hours.

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from the time the cake needs to be ready, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
3. Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all these times:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the total time required to complete all the steps. We need to convert this into hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

So, Jordan needs 3 hours to complete the cake from start to finish. If she wants the cake to be ready at 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is:
2:00 pm"
"To solve this, let's first figure out how many boxes they sold in total.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So together they sold:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

They sold 64 chocolate bars in total. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes they sold.

So, we divide 64 by 8:
64 ÷ 8 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session:** $25
2. **Cost per student per session:** $1.50
3. **Number of students:** 10
4. **Number of days the studio is rented per week:** 3
5. **Number of weeks in a month:** Let's assume 4 weeks for simplicity.

First, calculate the cost per session for 10 students:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \text{ per session} \]

Next, add the rental cost to the cost per session:
\[ \$25 \text{ (rental cost)} + \$15 \text{ (student cost)} = \$40 \text{ per session} \]

Now, calculate the total earnings per week:
\[ \$40 \text{ per session} \times 3 \text{ days} = \$120 \text{ per week} \]

Finally, calculate the total earnings for the month:
\[ \$120 \text{ per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$480 \text{ per month} \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Peter has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes Martha has:

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:

8"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. The total population is 50.

So, the number of female porcupines is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:
\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:
\[ 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines will be the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year:
\[ 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1490 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what the pool is) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this volume.
```python
# Dimensions of the pool
length = 25  # in feet
width = 14   # in feet
depth = 4    # in feet

# Calculate the volume
volume = length * width * depth
volume
```
```output
1400
```
The volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet. 

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water are required. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = \text{Volume} \times 5.9 \]

So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Calculate the gallons needed
gallons_needed = volume * 5.9
gallons_needed
```
```output
NameError: name 'volume' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference. Let me re-calculate the gallons needed directly using the volume we previously found.

\[ \text{Gallons needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's do this calculation.
```python
# Recalculate gallons needed directly
gallons_needed = 1400 * 5.9
gallons_needed
```
```output
8260.0
```
The pool needs 8260 gallons of water to be filled.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons needed} \times 0.10 \]

So, the cost is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this.
```python
# Calculate the cost
cost = gallons_needed * 0.10
cost
```
```output
NameError: name 'gallons_needed' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference again. Let me directly calculate the cost using the gallons needed we previously found.

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's do this calculation.
```python
# Directly calculate the cost
cost = 8260 * 0.10
cost
```
```output
python
print(cost)
```
```output
NameError: name 'cost' is not defined
```
It seems there was an issue with the variable reference again. Let me directly provide the final cost without referencing the variable.

The cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{826}\) dollars."
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, let's calculate how far Matteo traveled. Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Matteo:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Shandy traveled. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**:
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Number of students over 16 years old = \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

3. **Students under 16 years old**:
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Number of students under 16 years old = \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)

4. **Male students over 16 years old**:
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
   - Number of male students over 16 years old = \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)

5. **Female students over 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students over 16 years old are female.
   - Number of female students over 16 years old = \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \)

6. **Male students under 16 years old**:
   - One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Number of male students under 16 years old = \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)

7. **Female students under 16 years old**:
   - The rest of the students under 16 years old are female.
   - Number of female students under 16 years old = \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

8. **Total number of female students**:
   - Sum of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old.
   - Total number of female students = \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \)

The final numerical answer is 1875."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run based on the information given:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much water was filled into the tank on each day and how much is left to fill the tank.

### Day 1:
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
- So, Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- So, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water filled on the first day: \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

### Day 2:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- So, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- So, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water filled on the second day: \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

### Total Water Filled:
- Total water filled in two days: \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

### Water Remaining:
- The tank's total capacity is 18000 gallons.
- Water remaining to fill the tank: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is 6000 gallons."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank was 100%.
2. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge would be:
   - After 1 hour: 100% - 9% = 91%
   - After 2 hours: 91% - 9% = 82.1%
   - After 3 hours: 82.1% - 9% = 73.1%
   - After 4 hours: 73.1% - 9% = 64.19%
   - After 5 hours: 64.19% - 9% = 55.19%
3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after 8 hours in total, the charge would be:
   - After 6 hours: 55.19% - 7% = 48.19%
   - After 7 hours: 48.19% - 7% = 41.173%
   - After 8 hours: 41.173% - 7% = 34.173%
4. We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 28%.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns in a week. She earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The car costs $10000, and she wants to save 20% of this amount for the down payment. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 10000 \times 0.20 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After buying the fruits he has already purchased, he has:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost $0.25 each. With $0.75, he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums.

"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in the 13 packs she gave to her friends:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the price of carrots after each year, increasing by 5% each year. Let's start with the initial price of $120 and apply the 5% increase for each of the three years.

First year:
The price increases by 5% of $120.
5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
So, the new price after the first year = $120 + $6 = $126

Second year:
The price increases by 5% of $126.
5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
So, the new price after the second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Third year:
The price increases by 5% of $132.30.
5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
So, the new price after the third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the final price of carrots after three years is $139."
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then determine how many selfies and portraits she has.

First, we know Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and she put them into 8 albums. So, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album has 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album has 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

- Number of portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the price of a small stuffed animal:**
   Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

2. **Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**
   Large stuffed animals cost three times as much as small ones, so:
   \[
   \text{Price of large stuffed animal} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Define variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

4. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   The total earnings from selling the small stuffed animals is:
   \[
   4 \times 2x = 8x \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The total earnings from selling the large stuffed animals is:
   \[
   12 \times x = 12x \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120:
   \[
   8x + 12x = 120

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total money Suzanne earned from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

If there were 100 eggs hidden and 60 were found by the Smith twins, then 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

Out of these 40 eggs, 10 were not found by the friends. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds.
   - Therefore, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds of ore per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.
   - 40 dwarves will mine \(40 \times 18 = 720\) pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - The total ore mined in a month is \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:
21600"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given prices of the other packages. We know that the prices are proportional, which means the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is the same for all packages.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we need to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. Using the price per sandwich:
\[
\text{Price of the package with 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate how much Tom has left to pay after selling his old bedroom and using the money to pay part of the new bedroom set.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. So, he has $1000 left from selling his old bedroom to pay part of the new set.

Now, subtract the $1000 from the $3000 to find out how much he still needs to pay:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 per month. To find out how much that is, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons and 40% of them burst.

\[
\text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times 0.40 = 10
\]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[
25 - 10 = 15
\]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She started with 12 yellow balloons.

\[
\text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times 0.50 = 6
\]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.

\[
\text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6
\]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:

\[
15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
27

"To solve this, let's break down the chances step by step:

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher won't collect the homework. This means there's a 50% chance the normal teacher will come in.

2. **Normal Teacher and Extension**: If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension.

3. **Personal Extension**: If the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the overall chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher**: 50% chance he doesn't have to turn it in.
- **Normal Teacher**:
  - 60% chance he doesn't get an extension (60% of 60% = 36%).
  - 40% chance he gets an extension (40% of 60% = 24%).

So, the total chance he has to turn in his homework is the sum of the chances he doesn't get an extension from the normal teacher:
- 50% (substitute teacher) + 24% (normal teacher extension) = 74%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 74%."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats available: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Seats left = Total seats - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats left = 6000 - 950 - 300 = 5750

Now, we need to split these 5750 seats equally among the graduates. 

Number of graduates = 950

Tickets per graduate = Seats left / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5750 / 950 = 6

So, each graduate would receive 6 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, if he eats 75 large beans, he can eat \( 75 \times 2 = 150 \) medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we need to find out how many groups of 3 small beans are in 150 medium-sized beans. Since 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, 150 medium-sized beans are equivalent to \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \) small beans.

So, the final numerical answer is 450."
"First, let's calculate the total time Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total pay for the 3 days. She is paid $15 per day, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total pay:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total pay after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place along his driveway and then calculate the total time it will take him to place the candy in each bottle.

1. **Determine the number of soda bottles:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle every 3 feet.
   - To find the number of bottles, we divide the total width by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time to place the candy in each bottle:**
   - Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and place the candy.
   - He needs to go from the first bottle to the second, then from the second to the third, and so on, until the last bottle.
   - This means he will make 7 trips (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time for all trips:**
   - Each trip takes 5 seconds.
   - Therefore, the total time for 7 trips is:
     \[
     7 \text{ trips} \times 5 \text{ seconds/trip} = 35 \text{ seconds}

- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.

The cost of the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

The cost of the mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, let's add the total cost of the cheese:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, the final amount of money Amor has left to buy meat is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Jim's income while in college:**
   - Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
   - After college, his income triples, so it becomes $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year.

2. **Calculate the total income Jim earns while in college:**
   - He spends 4 years in college.
   - His income while in college is $75,000 per year.
   - Total income earned during college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took:**
   - He took $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

4. **Calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:**
   - Without college, he would have earned $25,000 per year.
   - Total income without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

5. **Calculate the total income Jim would have lost by not working while in college:**
   - Total income lost = $100,000 - $300,000 = -$200,000 (This is negative because he lost the opportunity to earn $100,000).

6. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to cover the loans and the lost income:**
   - Total amount to cover = $200,000 (loan amount) + $200,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

7. **Calculate how long it would take to earn $400,000 at his post-college income of $75,000 per year:**
   - Time required = $400,000 / $75,000 per year = 5.33 years.

So, it would take Jim approximately 5.33 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the size of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet of fabric} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday's Letters:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Letters:**
   - Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery.
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - So, Tuesday's delivery is \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday's Letters:**
   - Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery.
   - Twice Tuesday's delivery is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - So, Wednesday's delivery is \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

4. **Total Letters Delivered:**
   - To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters delivered each day.
   - Total letters = Monday's letters + Tuesday's letters + Wednesday's letters
   - Total letters = 425 + 102 + 209

Now, let's add these numbers:
\[ 425 + 102 = 527 \]
\[ 527 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

$65 + $36 = $101.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won $1 + (2 * $5) = $1 + $10 = $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $11 (he won, so it's not lost)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
Average amount lost = $21.5 / 3 = $7.16666666667

Rounding to two decimal places, the average amount lost per race is $7.17.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the amount the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they took together is $1920. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - So, the total number of days they worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

2. **Determine the number of days they worked each day:**
   - They worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, the total hours worked by the team is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Next, we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms again:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The car's price depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the price of the car in 2008:
Price in 2008 = Price in 2007 * 0.79
Price in 2008 = $20000 * 0.79 = $15800

Now, let's calculate the price of the car in 2009:
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 * 0.79
Price in 2009 = $15800 * 0.79 = $12422

Finally, let's calculate the price of the car in 2010:
Price in 2010 = Price in 2009 * 0.79
Price in 2010 = $12422 * 0.79 = $9725.18

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9725.18."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we need to find out how many books are written in German. We know that 10% of the 50 books are in German. To find 10% of 50, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 50 = 5

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To find out how many tiles you need, you divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. So, you need 200 tiles.

Now, to find the total cost, you multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile. Each tile costs $12.

So, the total cost is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The final numerical answer is $2400."
"First, let's find out how much more the insurance cost because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. To find 60% of $120, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$120 = 0.60 \times 120 = \$72 \]

So, the increased cost is $72 more than the normal cost. Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the total cost per month:

\[ \$120 + \$72 = \$192 \]

James pays $192 a month. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \$192 \times 12 = \$2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2304 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheets Greg needs to wash each week:**
   - A twin bed requires 2 sheets (one for the top and one for the bottom).
   - A king bed requires 3 sheets (one for the top and one for the bottom, plus a sheet for the headboard).
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king bed.
   - So, for the twin beds: \(4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ sheets/bed} = 8 \text{ sheets}\).
   - For the king bed: \(1 \text{ bed} \times 3 \text{ sheets/bed} = 3 \text{ sheets}\).
   - Total sheets per week: \(8 \text{ sheets} + 3 \text{ sheets} = 11 \text{ sheets}\).

2. **Determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do each week:**
   - His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ sheets}\).
   - It can also wash 1 king set of sheets at a time, which is 3 sheets.
   - So, each load can wash \(4 \text{ sheets} + 3 \text{ sheets} = 7 \text{ sheets}\).
   - Number of loads per week: \(\frac{11 \text{ sheets}}{7 \text{ sheets/load}} \approx 1.57 \text{ loads}\).

3. **Calculate the number of loads per week:**
   - Since he can't do a fraction of a load, he needs to do 2 loads per week to cover 11 sheets.

4. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Number of loads per year: \(2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}\).

So, the final numerical answer is 104."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. So, they watch \(4 \div 2 = 2\) movies on Sunday.
3. In one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch \(4 + 2 = 6\) movies.
4. If they watch movies every weekend for 4 weeks, they watch \(6 \times 4 = 24\) movies.

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so before collecting those, he had 100 - 50 = 50 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has now is 50 (from last year) + 100 (this year) = 150 stickers.

The final numerical answer is 150."
"To solve this, let's first calculate how much cat food Imma's cats eat in one day.

Imma has 3 cats and feeds them 60 grams of cat food each time. Since she feeds them twice a day, the total amount of cat food they eat in one day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount they eat in one day:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - Total slices = 4 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 32 slices.

2. **Becky's Slices:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices:**
   - Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \).
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake: \( 10 = J + 3 \).
   - Solving for \( J \): \( J = 10 - 3 = 7 \) slices.

4. **Silvia's Slices:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake: \( 2J \).
   - Since \( J = 7 \), then \( 2J = 2 * 7 = 14 \) slices.

5. **Total Slices Eaten:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's call the time Donovan's part took \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. So we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side gives:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual costs mentioned:

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to in a day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails a day. This means he needs to respond to the rest of the emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5 day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, the final numerical answer is 320 emails."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add up all the classes that visited the Science Center over the week:

\[ 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 \]

Let's add these step by step:

First, add 32 and 64:
\[ 32 + 64 = 96 \]

Next, add 96 to 96:
\[ 96 + 96 = 192 \]

Then, add 30 to 192:
\[ 192 + 30 = 222 \]

Finally, add 25 to 222:
\[ 222 + 25 = 247 \]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up all his scores:
- First 3 tests: 100 each, so 100 + 100 + 100 = 300
- 4th test: 80

So, the total score is 300 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many they have left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many they have left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas, so the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left for the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many big coupons Anthony is sending. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones. Since he's sending 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney then ate 4 of these sandwiches, so the number of sandwiches left is:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches

Sidney then ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches he had is:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs

So, the final numerical answer is 24."
"First, let's determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Mr. Hezekiah originally had 20 trucks, and a quarter of them had mechanical failures:

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser:

\[
\text{Number of trucks that delivered} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that successfully made the delivery is:

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

3. **Calculate the cost without the promotion:**
   The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
   \[
   6 \text{ pounds of butter} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$24.00
   \]

4. **Apply the promotion:**
   Dennis needs to buy 6 pounds of butter. With the promotion, he only pays for 3 pounds (since he gets 1 pound free for every 2 pounds he buys).
   \[
   3 \text{ pounds of butter} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00

"First, let's calculate the total number of people invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls in her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who couldn't come:

- Total people who can come = 45 - 4 = 41 people.

Now, we need to calculate the cost. The base fee is $125 for the first 20 people, and then an additional $6 per person for each person over 20.

- Cost for the first 20 people = $125.
- Number of additional people = 41 - 20 = 21 people.
- Cost for the additional people = 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the base fee and the additional cost:

- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the party will cost $251."
"Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent $60 / 4 = $15. So, Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent $60 / 3 = $20. So, Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.

"First, let's calculate how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week. Since one monkey eats 10 bananas each day, in a week (7 days) the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many bananas the second monkey eats in a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week. The total number of bananas is 315, and we know the first and second monkeys eat 70 and 98 bananas respectively in a week. So, the third monkey eats:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 70 \text{ bananas} - 98 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats the same amount of bananas each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \text{ bills} \times \$5 \text{ per bill} = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to pay for the roses. The florist offers roses by the dozen at $15, so Jenny can buy 1 dozen roses (which is 12 roses) for $15. This leaves her with:

\[ \$30 - \$15 = \$15 \]

Now, she needs to pay the remaining $15. Since she has $25 initially and she needs $15 more, she will have:

\[ \$25 - \$15 = \$10 \]

After paying for the roses, she will have $10 left. Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to determine how many quarters make up $10. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she will receive is:

\[ \frac{10}{0.25} = 40 \]

So, Jenny will leave with 40 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the milkshakes:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
- Each milkshake costs $5.50.
- Total earnings from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the burger platters:
- Terry sells 9 burger platters.
- Each burger platter costs $11.
- Total earnings from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99.00

Then, let's calculate the earnings from the sodas:
- Terry sells 20 sodas.
- Each soda costs $1.50.
- Total earnings from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

Now, we add up the earnings from all the items:
- Total earnings = Earnings from milkshakes + Earnings from burger platters + Earnings from sodas
- Total earnings = $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the schedule of the trains and calculate the time Paul will wait for his train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves after 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 30 = 40 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time.
   - First train's stay time is 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Second train arrives 40 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives in 40 + 5 = 45 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves after 45 minutes, so it arrives in 45 + 60 = 105 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 105 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 105 minutes, so it arrives in 105 + 20 = 125 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 125 minutes. Since he arrives at 105 minutes (when the third train leaves), he will wait for 125 - 105 = 20 minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[
10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. Therefore, she still needs:

\[
200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
\]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[
\frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
\]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Original Price of the Watch:**
   The original price of the watch is $2000.

2. **Price Mr. Rogers Paid:**
   Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Price Mr. Rogers Sold the Watch For:**
   Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800
   \]

4. **Percentage Discount Obtained by Mr. Rogers' Friend:**
   The friend bought the watch for $1500 and sold it for $1800. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1500 = 500

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 25%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish are created by 5 springs in 4 hours. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created by one spring.
   - Therefore, one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - In 4 hours, there are \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the final numerical answer is:
72000"
"Binkie's score was 90. Twice as high as Binkie's score would be 90 * 2 = 180. Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score, so Frankie's score was 180 + 15 = 195.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James walks halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.
4. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
5. To find out how long it took him, we divide the total distance by his speed: 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny bought in total. She bought 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas is:

10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Next, we need to calculate the cost of these bananas if she bought them individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas would be:

40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the bananas if she bought them in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost would be:

10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:

$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

So, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet of the fence.
2. Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet of the fence.
3. Together, they have 100 feet of fence.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to calculate the total amount of fence and subtract what Sam gets:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

So, the amount left over for Sam is 80 feet.

"To solve this, we need to find out how much the crocodile grows per year first. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so we divide 8 inches by 4 years to find the growth per year:

\[ \text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how much it grows in 13 years, we multiply the growth per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**

   - Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling all the bikes:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from MTB + Earnings from BMX + Earnings from Trekking bikes
   - Total earnings = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

So, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up by the truck in a 6-hour day.

First, let's calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:
- The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

Next, let's calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:
- The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
- In 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

Now, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer to find out how many bales are left in the field:
- Bales made by the farmer: 30
- Bales picked up by the truck: 18
- Bales left in the field: \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

So, the final number of bales of hay left in the field is 12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Normal number of periods**: 6 periods
2. **Extra classes**: 2 extra classes
3. **Total classes per day**: 6 + 2 = 8 classes
4. **Duration of each class**: 40 minutes
5. **Days per week**: 5 days (Monday to Friday)
6. **Weekend learning time**: 1/16 of the weekly minutes

First, calculate the total minutes spent in classes per day:
\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, calculate the total minutes spent in classes per week:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, convert the total minutes spent in classes per week to hours:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = \frac{1600}{60} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{160}{6} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{80}{3} \text{ hours/week} \approx 26.67 \text{ hours/week} \]

For the weekend learning time, we need to find 1/16 of the weekly minutes:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Convert the weekend learning time to hours:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = \frac{100}{60} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours/week} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours/week} \]

Finally, add the weekday learning time and the weekend learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 26.67 \text{ hours/week} + 1.67 \text{ hours/week} = 28.34 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 28.34 \text{ hours/week} \]"
"First, let's calculate the height of the third-floor balcony. Each story is 24 feet high, so the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When Nathan drops the ball, it bounces to 2/3 of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert everything to inches to make it easier to calculate.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings. If each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of it, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
3. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
4. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
1080"
"To solve this, let's calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet each, so the total area for these two walls is:
2 * (10 * 8) = 2 * 80 = 160 square feet

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet each, so the total area for these two walls is:
2 * (5 * 8) = 2 * 40 = 80 square feet

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
160 + 80 = 240 square feet

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we need:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost will be:
12 * 12 = $144

The final numerical answer is:
144"
"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 unshaken and 2 shaken sodas.
4. Ellen's friend comes along. We need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

Now, we have 2 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. The total number of sodas is 4. The number of sodas that are shaken is 2.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas. So, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 50%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
   - The first train travels \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
   - The second train travels \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each train has traveled.
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

So, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:**
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

2. **Calculate the number of days Billy takes off:**
   - Billy takes 20% off.
   - Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

3. **Calculate the number of days Billy works:**
   - Total days - days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. **Calculate the number of hours Billy works per day:**
   - Billy works 3 hours a day.

5. **Calculate the total number of hours Billy works:**
   - Total hours = 40 days * 3 hours/day = 120 hours.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of people that could have been in the cars and buses, and then subtract that from the total number of vehicles to find out how many people were inside the church.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- So, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- So, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

Now, let's add the number of people in the cars and buses to find the total number of people that could have been outside the church:
- Total number of people outside the church is \(60 + 420 = 480\).

Since there were 20 cars and 12 buses, the total number of vehicles is \(20 + 12 = 32\).

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is the total number of people outside the church minus the total number of vehicles:
- Number of people inside the church is \(480 - 32 = 448\).

So, the final numerical answer is 448."
"First, let's find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20 years old

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30 years old

So, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for people to slide down each waterslide and then find the difference in time.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide:
- Length of the biggest waterslide: 300 feet
- Speed of sliding: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest waterslide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
- Length of the second biggest waterslide: 240 feet
- Speed of sliding: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest waterslide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The final numerical answer is:

Bobby takes:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks each day:
- 15 minutes break + 15 minutes break = 30 minutes

Now, let's add the time for lunch and breaks each day:
- 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

- 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's miles as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's miles} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles run by all three is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Lauren saves 20% of her salary each paycheck.
2. Her current salary is $100,000.
3. She plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years.
4. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.

First, let's calculate how much she saves each year:
- 20% of $100,000 = $20,000 saved each year.

Next, let's calculate how much she will live on each year:
- 40% of $100,000 = $40,000 spent each year.

Now, let's find out how much she needs to save for retirement:
- She needs to save $20,000 each year for 20 years.
- Total savings needed = $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Now, let's see how much she can live on each year:
- She can live on $40,000 each year.

To find out how many years she needs to work to save $400,000:
- Number of years needed = Total savings needed / Annual savings = $400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( T \).

Since 40% of the total students are boys, we can write:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the school is:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"First, let's determine the total number of days in June. June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Let's calculate how many miles she plans to hike in total if she walks twice a day.

\[
\text{Miles per day if walking twice} = 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles}
\]

\[
\text{Total miles planned} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles}
\]

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles, but she plans to hike 7,500 miles. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike, we subtract the planned miles from the total miles she needs to hike:

\[
\text{Miles needed} = 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to cover the remaining 1800 miles in 30 days. We divide the remaining miles by the number of days in June:

\[
\text{Miles per day needed} = \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
\]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. Amalia's chore was mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
2. Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Megan's time is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since Amalia's time was 4 hours, Dior's time is:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]
   (Note: ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 4 hours, but for simplicity, we assume 8 hours as a reasonable estimate.)

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents.

First, let's determine the distance John drives one way. We know that he drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours to drive there.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance one way = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes two round trips each month. A round trip means driving to his parents and back, so the round trip distance is:

Round trip distance = 140 miles (one way) × 2 = 280 miles

So, the total distance John drives each month is:

Total monthly distance = 280 miles

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

280 miles"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how far Sofie will walk in 7 days:**
   - Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.
   - In 7 days, she will walk \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Relate Sofie's distance to Brian's distance:**
   - According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
   - Let \( B \) be the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days.
   - Therefore, \( 70 \text{ miles} = 2B \).

3. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - To find \( B \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is:
35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many toys the first 4 workers can produce in 10 hours.

Two workers produce 6 toys per hour:
- Total production per hour by these two workers: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) toys
- Total production in 10 hours: \( 12 \times 10 = 120 \) toys

The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour:
- Total production per hour by these two workers: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) toys
- Total production in 10 hours: \( 8 \times 10 = 80 \) toys

Now, let's add the total production of all four workers:
- Total production by all four workers in 10 hours: \( 120 + 80 = 200 \) toys

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the 10-hour shift, they have produced 200 toys. They still need 20 more toys to ship the order.

So, the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker in 10 hours is:
- Total toys needed: 400
- Toys already produced: 200
- Toys still needed: 20
- Total toys produced by the fifth worker: \( 400 - 200 - 20 = 180 \) toys

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
- Toys produced per hour by the fifth worker: \( \frac{180}{10} = 18 \) toys per hour

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"First, let's find out the weight of Elijah's dogs.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say Seth originally had \( S \) stickers.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of his stickers, so he gave the other half to Kris. Therefore, Kris got \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means Kris originally got \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
5. Since Kris got 16 stickers, and that was half of what Luis got, Luis must have gotten \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) stickers.
6. Since Luis got 32 stickers, and that was half of what Seth gave him, Seth must have given \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) stickers to Luis.
7. Since Seth gave 64 stickers to Luis, and that was half of what Seth originally had, Seth must have had \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) stickers in the beginning.

So, the final numerical answer is 128."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&M's John has. He has 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M's are in 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&M's has 30 M&M's. So, for 30 ounces, the number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:

\[ 900 \div 10 = 90 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it takes for Alfie to fly a distance that is half of the way around the Earth.

1. First, we need to find out what half of the Earth's circumference is:
   \[
   \text{Half of the Earth's circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

2. Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car is. We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour, and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.

So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25 to find the speed of the faster car.

The speed of the faster car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \text{ mph} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Liam's current age is 16 years.
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.
3. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( x \), then \( 14 = 2x \).
4. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 14 / 2 = 7 \). So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old.
5. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \).

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

The final numerical answer is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Arnold and Madeline each painted \( x \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted \( y \) eggs, so Camden painted \( y + 12 \) eggs.
3. Since Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, we can write the equation:
   \[
   y + (y + 12) = 30
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2y + 12 = 30
   \]
5. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   2y = 18
   \]
6. Divide by 2:
   \[
   y = 9
   \]
   So, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.
7. Arnold and Madeline together painted \( x + x = 2x \) eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So we can write:
   \[
   2x + 9 + 21 = 56
   \]
8. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2x + 30 = 56
   \]
9. Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 26
   \]
10. Divide by 2:
    \[
    x = 13
    \]
    So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Now, we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
   \[
   21 - 13 = 8

So, the final answer is 8."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each.

Each group of 8 crayons will weigh 8 ounces because each crayon weighs 1 ounce.

Now, let's find out the total weight of the crayons. Since each group of 8 crayons weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 groups:

\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the boxes. Since each box holds 8 crayons and each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes:

\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's find out how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.8 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Next, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice their combined salary. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice this amount:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3-mile trail, given the distances and speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes, we can write the equation for her speed on the beach as:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know the time spent on the beach is 40 minutes and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time for the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[
4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[
60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save $28.

\[
\frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}
\]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

7"

"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that initially, Bob has:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees and the other is an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( x \) degrees.
2. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means the 33-degree mug now has \( 33 - 4 = 29 \) degrees of water left.
3. Donny also pours 1 ounce of water from the other mug into his water bottle. This means the other mug now has \( x - 1 \) degrees of water left.
4. After pouring, Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. This means the temperature of the water in his water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's consider the temperature of the water in the water bottle after the pours:
- From the 33-degree mug, he gets 4 ounces of water, which is 29 degrees.
- From the other mug, he gets 1 ounce of water, which is \( x - 1 \) degrees.

The total temperature of the water in his water bottle is the sum of the temperatures of the water from both mugs:
\[ 29 + (x - 1) = 28 + x \]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, the total temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ 28 + x \geq 40 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x \geq 40 - 28 \]
\[ x \geq 12 \]

So, the second bottle must be at least 12 degrees to allow Donny to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial number of animals:**

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days

3. **Number of cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows per day

4. **Number of chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens per day

5. **Total number of cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

6. **Total number of chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

7. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the final number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00:

The discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Each pack contains 9 bagels, and he orders 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 2 scoops. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, 3 less than 6 is:
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
   \]
   Therefore, for 2 scoops, the number of potatoes needed is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ potatoes}

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many men and women are initially on the bus and then determine how many women remain after 20 women alight.

First, let's denote the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\). The total number of passengers is given by the sum of men and women, which is \(5x + 9x = 14x\). We know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation:
\[14x = 84\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]
So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

Next, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. Initially, there are 54 women, and 20 women alight, so the number of women remaining is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. We know that each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from selling sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers sold in one day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\$26}{\$2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bouquets of sunflowers Faraday sold in one day. Each bouquet costs $8 and he earned $56 from selling bouquets. So, the number of bouquets sold in one day is:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\$56}{\$8} = 7 \text{ bouquets} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold in 3 days. Since he sold 13 sunflowers per day, in 3 days he sold:

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5.

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Adam buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. To find out how many rocks he sells:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[
\text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw all the picture scenes for the project.

First, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days for large-sized scenes = \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

Next, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days for medium-sized scenes = \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

Finally, let's calculate the number of days it will take her to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- Number of days for small-sized scenes = \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

First, let's find the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- Sid traveled for 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Ticket:**
   - The probability of winning the first ticket is given as 20%, which can be written as a decimal: \(0.20\).

2. **Second Ticket:**
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.
   - If the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, then the second ticket, being three times more likely, would have a \(3 \times 20\% = 60\%\) chance of winning.
   - Converting 60% to a decimal, we get \(0.60\).

3. **Probability of Both Tickets Winning:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), we multiply the probabilities of each event happening.
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

4. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - To convert the decimal \(0.12\) back to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(12\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12\%}

"First, let's find out how many seashells each person collected.

Jim collected 27 seashells.

Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so:
Carlos = Jim - 5 = 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so:
Carrey = Carlos / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
Total seashells = Jim + Carlos + Carrey = 27 + 22 + 11 = 59 seashells.

They divided the seashells equally between themselves, so each person got:
Each person = Total seashells / 3 = 59 / 3 = 19.67 seashells.

Since we can't have a fraction of a seashell, we'll assume they divided them as evenly as possible, which means each person would get 19 seashells, and there would be 1 seashell left over. However, the question asks for the final numerical answer, so we'll provide the division result:

Each person got 19.67 seashells."
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for weekdays and the total for weekends separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- He eats 4 carrots each weekday.

So, the total for weekdays is:
\[ 5 \text{ weekdays} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekends:
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- He eats 5 carrots each day on the weekend.

So, the total for the weekend is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the totals from weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots (weekdays)} + 10 \text{ carrots (weekend)} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To solve this, let's first find out the length of the second song.

The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how much longer, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. Therefore, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

2. **Selling price of one mobile device:** Twice the original price, so $20 * 2 = $40
3. **Number of devices bought last Monday:** 2
4. **Number of devices bought last Tuesday:** 4

Now, let's calculate the total cost and total revenue.

**Total cost:**
- Cost of 2 devices: $20 * 2 = $40
- Cost of 4 devices: $20 * 4 = $80
- Total cost: $40 + $80 = $120

**Total revenue:**
- Revenue from 2 devices: $40 * 2 = $80
- Revenue from 4 devices: $40 * 4 = $160
- Total revenue: $80 + $160 = $240

"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \text{ feet} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \text{ foot} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to find out how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. So, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, we need 5 bottles per person, so we need 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.

Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the number they can produce from the number they need:

11500 bottles needed - 4200 bottles produced = 7300 bottles.

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is 7300."

2. **Wearing Bows:**
   - All the babies dressed in blue also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows.

   Calculating the number of babies wearing bows:
   - All 2 babies dressed in blue wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 babies dressed in purple wear bows:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies in purple wear bows}

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in each transaction.

1. Abraham owns 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of his land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. One quarter of 80 square meters is 20 square meters. So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.
4. The remaining land is the total land minus the land sold in the first and second transactions. So, the remaining land is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters. He sold this remaining land for $3 per square meter.

Now, let's calculate the total money Abraham earned from each sale:

- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the remaining land: 20 square meters * $3 per square meter = $60

Adding these amounts together gives the total money Abraham earned:

$50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"First, let's figure out how many eggs Cole hid. He hid 3 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:

3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs

Now let's find out how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now we add up all the eggs that were found:

5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope can be expressed as \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope can be expressed as \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4 \times (Y - 7) = 37 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Next, solve for \( Y \):

\[ 6Y = 37 + 35 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. Let's confirm this by checking the total length:

\[ 12 + 5 + 20 = 37 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa and Ronnie were given initially:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = $15\).

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**
   - After giving \(x\) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount.
   - So, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\).
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\).

4. **Determine how much money Rissa has left:**
   - Rissa originally had $15 and gave $3 to her sister, so she is left with \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie originally had $5 and did not give any money to his sister, so he still has $5.

So, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is $5.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. The mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow.
3. The red, white, and purple parts are equal in amount.
4. The yellow part is half the mural.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the red, white, and purple parts are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \), and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

The yellow part is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

Now, we can write the equation for the total amount of paint:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
- Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet.
- Area of one bedroom = 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
- Total area of 4 bedrooms = 4 * 240 square feet = 960 square feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the living room:
- The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
- Area of the living room = 5 * 240 square feet = 1200 square feet.

Now, we know the rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
- Total area of the house = Area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
- Total area of the house = 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"To solve this, let's first find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, which has 100 pods.

20% of 100 pods is \(100 \times 0.20 = 20\) pods.

So, the new box has \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

The new box costs the same as the regular box, which is $12. We need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

First, we find out how many pods we can get for $1. Since $12 buys 120 pods, $1 will buy \(120 \div 12 = 10\) pods.

So, with $1, we can run 10 cycles.

"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of 20 dollar bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, Thomas uses half of the remaining 20 dollar bills to pay for a bill. The number of 20 dollar bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of 20 dollar bills he has left is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, Thomas triples his money. Since each 20 dollar bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

When he triples this amount, he gets:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Now, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. Since each 5 dollar bill is worth $5, the number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Usage**: The teacher uses 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. So, the chalk used is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}

   Therefore, the remaining chalk is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}

"First, let's figure out how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to find out how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

To find out how many masks Johnny bought, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
2. Add 2 to that number to find out how many masks Johnny bought: \( 15 + 2 = 17 \)

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth.
2. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.
4. The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula: (number of teeth fixed / total number of teeth) * 100.
6. So, the percentage of teeth fixed is (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

The final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially bought. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
\]

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date.

\[
\text{Amount of milk with expiry date} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

The amount of milk that could not be sold is 1600 gallons. Since Mr. Marcellus returned this milk to the company, he is entitled to a refund for this amount.

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 1600 \times \left(3 + 0.5\right) = 1600 \times 3 + 1600 \times 0.5 = 4800 + 800 = 5600
\]

So, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:

\[
\boxed{5600}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Wendy's current age is \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   - Colin's age in seven years will be \( C + 7 \).
   - So, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times Colin's age in seven years: \( W = 5(C + 7) \).

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
   - Wendy's current age \( W \) is three times Colin's age in 25 years: \( W = 3(C + 25) \).

Now we have two expressions for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 3(C + 25) \]

We can set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 5(C + 7) = 3(C + 25) \]

Let's solve this equation for \( C \):
\[ 5C + 35 = 3C + 75 \]
\[ 5C - 3C = 75 - 35 \]
\[ 2C = 40 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, let's check the conditions:
1. If Colin is 20 years old now, in seven years he will be 27 years old. Wendy's current age is \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \).
2. In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old. Wendy's current age is 135, and 45 is indeed a third of 135.

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. 

He can buy 100 books for $500. So, to find out how many books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, Bob can buy 54 books with $27000.

Now, he wants to distribute these 54 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide 54 by 3:

\[ \frac{54}{3} = 18 \]

So, Bob can buy 18 books per school. 

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Apple Falls:**
   - One apple fell out of the tree and landed on Newton's head.
   - Apples on the ground: 1

2. **Newton's First Action:**
   - Newton picked up the two apples (the one on his head and the one that fell).
   - He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1

3. **Second Apple Falls:**
   - 5 more apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 + 5 = 6

4. **Newton's Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all 6 apples on the ground.
   - He put all but one in his pocket.
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 + 1 = 2
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1

5. **Third Apple Falls:**
   - 6 more apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 6 + 6 = 12

6. **Newton's Third Action:**
   - Newton picked up all 12 apples on the ground.
   - He put all but one in his pocket.
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 + 1 = 3
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1

Now, Newton has 3 apples in his pocket. Therefore, the final number of apples he brought home is:

"First, let's calculate how many cheese pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends.
So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

Next, let's calculate how many pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends eat in total:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends.
So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas Kate needs to buy.

For the cheese pizza:
Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
To find out how many whole cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza:
Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
To find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and she needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

From the question, we know:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles * 3 days = 9 miles.
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday. That's 5 miles * 2 days = 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the miles from Tuesday and Thursday:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

So, the final numerical answer is 19 miles."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
3. So, in 15 minutes, 20 - 2 = 18 snowballs are made.
4. This means in 1 hour (60 minutes), 18 * 4 = 72 snowballs would be made if no snowballs melted.
5. But since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to account for the melting.
6. In 1 hour, 4 sets of 15 minutes pass, so 4 * 2 = 8 snowballs melt.
7. Therefore, in 1 hour, 72 - 8 = 64 snowballs are actually made.
8. To get 60 snowballs, we need to find how many hours it takes to make 60 snowballs.
9. Since 64 snowballs are made in 1 hour, we can see that 60 snowballs are less than 64.
10. We can calculate the time it takes to make 60 snowballs by setting up a proportion. If 64 snowballs take 1 hour, then 60 snowballs would take less time.
11. We can use the ratio: 64 snowballs / 1 hour = 60 snowballs / x hours.
12. Solving for x, we get x = 60 * 1 / 64 = 60 / 64 = 15 / 16 hours.
13. Converting 15/16 hours to minutes: (15/16) * 60 = 93.75 minutes.

So, it will take Jay 93.75 minutes to have 60 snowballs."
"If John is 28 years old now and he is twice as old as Jim when the Digimon came out, we can figure out Jim's age by dividing John's age by 2.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had \(50\) bandages at the end of the first day.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - They had \(22\) bandages at the end of the second day.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages.

According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there was a discrepancy in the calculation. Let's recheck the bandages used and ordered:

- They ordered 100 bandages on the third day but only used 25, so they had \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages added to their stock.
- They had 22 bandages at the end of the second day, so after ordering and using, they should have \(22 + 75 = 97\) bandages.

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a different interpretation needed. However, based on the given information and the steps, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly rate and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.
- Her daily earnings are $11.25.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Weekly earnings = $67.50/week
- Number of weeks in April = 4

Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270

Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Weekly bonus = $10
- Number of weeks in April = 4

Total bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her total earnings for the month to her total bonus:
- Total earnings for April = $270
- Total bonus for April = $40

Final total amount Jen will receive = $270 + $40 = $310

So, Jen will receive $310."
"Let's break down the earnings for Jason:

- For doing laundry, he earns $3.00 once.
- For cleaning his room, he earns $1.50 once.
- For taking the trash out, he earns $0.75 each time, and he did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
- For emptying the dishwasher, he earns $0.50 each time, and he did it 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add up all the earnings:

- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning room: $1.50
- Taking trash out: $1.50
- Emptying dishwasher: $3.00

Total earnings = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.00

"First, let's find out how much blood one shark has. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood volume of one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood volume of ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Morning People**: 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.
2. **People at 10:00**: 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
3. **People in the Afternoon**: Twice the number of people who came at 10:00 came in later. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came in the afternoon.
4. **People in the Evening**: Three times the number of people who came in the morning came in the evening. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came in the evening.

Now, let's add up all the people who entered the restaurant throughout the day:

- Morning: 50 people
- 10:00: 40 people
- Afternoon: 80 people
- Evening: 150 people

Total number of people = \(50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260\)

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 260."

"First, let's find out how much each bottle of scotch costs. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. So, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day:
- He planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the first day, the total number of trees planted is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees he planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\). So, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, on the second day, the total number of trees planted is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to get the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means she loses 4 colors:
\[ 26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors} \]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since one makeup set originally had 6 colors, half of that is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors} \]

"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's two-story house is. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor is. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. So, we calculate the height of the first floor as:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the house is two stories tall, the height of the second floor is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The roof is the same height as the second floor because the problem doesn't specify any difference in height between the two floors. Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after paying off his debts. He originally had the loan amount of $100,000, and he used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the tunas.
2. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram.

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:
- The price per kilogram is $0.50.

So, the total earnings are:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Trinity sold each magazine for. She sold them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, she sold each magazine for $99.

Next, we need to find out her profit. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]

Given that the cost price is $72, we have:

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, her profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each setting:

- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: 2 * 1 liter = 2 liters per day
- High setting: 2 * 2 liters = 4 liters per day

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed for each period:

- For the low setting over 3 days:
  1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters

- For the medium setting over 3 days:
  2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters

- For the high setting over 5 days:
  4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Now, we add up the total amount of water removed over all the days:

3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."
"First, let's calculate the total number of balloons they filled up:

They have 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.

To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

300 balloons - 12 balloons left = 288 balloons thrown

So, the final numerical answer is 288."
"First, let's find out how much medicine is in one dose.

The first medicine is 14 mL.
The second medicine is 3 times the first medicine, so it's 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

So, in one dose, there are 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Now, to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

So, the final numerical answer is 448 mL."
"First, let's find out how many students Ali's class can hold. According to the question, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Now, let's find out how many students John's classes can hold. The question states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Capacity of John's class} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's classes is:

\[ \text{Total capacity for John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen owes:**
   Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest.
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be returned} = 300 + 6 = 306
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over 11 months:**
   Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months.
   \[
   \text{Total payment over 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275

"To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps to determine how many jelly beans Tim guessed and then compare it to the true number of red jelly beans.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume of jelly beans considering packing efficiency:**
   The jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency.
   \[
   \text{Effective volume of jelly beans} = \frac{540}{0.8} = 675 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans based on the effective volume:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{675}{0.15} = 4500
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 4500 = 1350
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 1350 - 900 = 450
   \]

So, Tim was 450 jelly beans off from the true number of red jelly beans."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit to the museum is $2.

2. **Increase in Cost After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - To find the new cost, we calculate 150% of $2 and add it to the original cost:
     \[
     150\% \text{ of } 2 = 1.5 \times 2 = 3
     \]
   - Adding this to the original cost:
     \[
     2 + 3 = 5
     \]
   - So, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is $5.

3. **Total Visits Over 8 Years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum three times a year.
   - Over 8 years (5 years + 3 more years), the total number of visits is:
     \[
     3 \text{ visits/year} \times 8 \text{ years} = 24 \text{ visits}
     \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2, so the total cost for these visits is:
     \[
     2 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5, so the total cost for these visits is:
     \[
     3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
     \[
     20 \text{ dollars} + 45 \text{ dollars} = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{65}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many groups of students will be trying the escape room and then calculate the total time based on the time each group takes.

1. First, we need to find out how many students are in the school. Since there are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), the total number of students is:
   \[
   10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups of 8 students we can make from 30 students, we divide 30 by 8:
   \[
   30 \div 8 = 3 \text{ groups with a remainder of 6 students}
   \]
   This means we can form 3 full groups of 8 students each, and there will be 6 students left over. Since the 6 students can't form another full group of 8, they will have to wait for the next round.

3. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since we have 3 full groups, the time it will take for these 3 groups to try the escape room is:
   \[
   3 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 135 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, it will take 135 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each, so the cost for the tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so the cost for the roof frames is:
2 frames * $10/frame = $20

To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we add the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's call the length of the shorter piece \( x \) feet. Then the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need for 80 meatballs.

First, we need to find out how much ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the amount of ground beef needed as follows:

\[
\text{Amount of ground beef needed} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs needed}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning is required. Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed as follows:

\[
\text{Total seasoning needed} = \text{Amount of ground beef needed} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

The final numerical answer is 350 inches."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after that.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining minutes (36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.2 per minute.
   - Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.2/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs of both parts to get the total cost:
- Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. It rained 2 inches on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount that fell on Monday.

First, we calculate twice the amount that fell on Monday:
- Twice the amount on Monday = 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

Then, we add 1 inch to this amount to find out how much it will rain on Tuesday:
- Rain on Tuesday = 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of treats needed. Since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Let's say Carly made \( c \) cupcakes. According to the problem, she made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she made is:
\[ 3c - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional costs:

- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these two costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional costs:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price for both services:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art costs $3:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the services:

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, Karen would pay in all:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year.
   - So, 3 magazines * 12 issues = 36 issues from these magazines.

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
   - So, 1 magazine * 6 issues = 6 issues from this magazine.

3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.
   - So, 4 * 6 issues = 24 issues from this magazine.

Now, let's add up all the issues:
- 36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues.

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is 66."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, to find out how many paintings Shelley has, we add 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. Let's put the final answer in a line:

"To solve this, let's follow the price changes step by step.

1. **November Price**: The toy was $40.

2. **December Price Increase**: The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   So, the price in December is $72.

3. **January Price Decrease**: The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36

   So, the price in January is $36.

The final numerical answer is:
36"
"First, let's calculate the standard fee for a 1-hour lesson, which is $80.

Next, we calculate the reduced fee for a lesson given to a veteran. The fee is reduced by 25%, so the veteran's fee is 75% of the standard fee:
\[ 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total money made from the standard lessons:
\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times 80 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total money made from the veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times 60 \text{ dollars/lesson} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the money from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ 320 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"To solve this, we need to find out how many novels Regina has written this year based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we need to solve for the ""novels this year"". We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's calculate this:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Cost of pasta per week:**
   - The pasta costs $1.00 a box.
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - Therefore, the cost of pasta per week is $1.00.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

4. **Total weekly cost:**
   - Add the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.
   - Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

5. **Number of weeks in a year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

6. **Total yearly cost:**
   - Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year.
   - Total yearly cost = $10.00/week \(\times\) 52 weeks/year = $520.00.

"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all the classrooms.

There are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours since the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. We need to find out what percentage of their 8-hour day is spent cleaning classrooms. To do this, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage seems unrealistic because it exceeds 100%. Let's recheck the calculations to ensure accuracy.

The total time spent cleaning is 20 hours, and the workday is 8 hours. The correct percentage should be:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

It seems there is a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation should be that the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning, which is not possible in a single day. Let's rephrase the question to find the average percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms over the 5 days.

If the total time needed is 20 hours and they have 5 days, the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the 8-hour day spent cleaning:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the capacity of each shelf:**
   - Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves.
   - Total capacity = capacity of middle shelf 1 + capacity of middle shelf 2 + capacity of bottom shelf + capacity of top shelf
   - Total capacity = \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

3. **Determine how many bookcases are needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - To find out how many bookcases are needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase.
   - Number of bookcases needed = \(\frac{110}{55} = 2\).

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all 110 books.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many eggs Rose bought. A dozen is 12 eggs, so five dozens is:

5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Next, let's find out how much Rose spent on the eggs. She bought them for $2.40 a dozen, and she bought five dozens:

5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Now, let's figure out how much she will sell the eggs for. She sells them for $1 for 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs, she will sell them in groups of 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs per $1 = 20 groups of 3 eggs

So, she will sell the eggs for:

20 groups * $1/group = $20.00

Finally, to find out Rose's profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:

$20.00 (selling price) - $12.00 (cost) = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

"First, let's figure out the cost of the beef jerky when it's $3.00 off. The original price of the bag is $18.00. So, the sale price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Now, we know that the bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the sale price by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since $1.00 = 100 cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents."
"To solve this, let's first calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. So, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times \frac{60}{100} = 70 \times 0.6 = 42 \]

Now, Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right to pass. The total number of questions in both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right:
\[ 110 \times \frac{70}{100} = 110 \times 0.7 = 77 \]

She already got 42 questions right on the first test, so the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = \frac{120}{6} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.

Next, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes. We use the expression \( 5S - 4 \):

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ 5S - 4 = 100 - 4 \]
\[ 5S - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is 96.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step based on the given averages.

1. **Determine how many customers Jason needs to see to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, Jason needs 2 customers.
   - Therefore, for 15 cars, he needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (because even if he doesn't get a customer, he still needs to make the calls).

2. **Determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, he needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of people**: There are 4 people in the house, including Brianna.
2. **Number of flashlights**: There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room. Since there are 8 rooms, there are 2 * 8 = 16 flashlights for the rooms. So, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.
3. **Number of rooms**: There are 8 rooms in the house.
4. **Candles**:
   - Half of the rooms have small candles. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. Each of these 4 rooms has 4 small candles. So, the total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
   - The other half of the rooms have medium candles. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. Each of these 4 rooms has 5 medium candles. So, the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.
   - The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, let's add up all the items:
- Flashlights: 20

- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- For 6 paintings, the total drying time is \( 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \( 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

1. Crista has 20 plants in total.
2. 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
3. 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
4. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water each.

First, we calculate the total water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup each. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants, the remaining number of plants is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ plants} \]

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."

- Half of the distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Half of the distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time spent hopping on land:
- Speed on land: 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land: 100 yards
- Time hopping: \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

Then, we calculate the time spent swimming in water:
- Speed in water: 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water: 100 yards
- Time swimming: \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \)

   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year = $6300.
   - It depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value at start of second year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year = $4410.
   - It depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value at start of third year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- There are 232 pieces of Starbursts candy in total.
- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so there are \(54 \times 2 = 108\) orange candies.
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are \(54 \div 2 = 27\) yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Total of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[ 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, the number of pink candies is 43.

The final numerical answer is:
43"
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given as $80.

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. The problem states that one bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, we calculate 10% of $80:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.10 \times 80 = \$8 \]

Now, Helen rode the bus 7 times. So, the total cost for the bus trips is:

\[ 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

To find the total cost for both the hotel and the bus trips, we add the two amounts together:

\[ \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any. If Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, then before dropping the marbles, Dallas had:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ended up with 25 marbles. So, the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie is:

\[ 25 \text{ marbles} \]

Since the total number of marbles Mazie had initially is 52, and Dallas received 25 marbles, the number of marbles Darla received is the remainder of Mazie's marbles after giving 25 to Dallas. Therefore, the number of marbles Darla received is:

\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- There are 2 adults, so the total cost for adult tickets is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the car and the luggage and the children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Now, let's add these weights together to get the total weight:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 1600 = \frac{1}{100} \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force needed to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To hang crepe-paper streamers around the fence, James needs to calculate the total length of the fence. Since the fence is a rectangle, he needs to add up the lengths of all four sides.

The long side is 20 feet and there are two of them, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 feet.
The short side is 15 feet and there are two of them, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 feet.

Now, add the lengths of the long sides and the short sides together:
40 feet + 30 feet = 70 feet.

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both of their ages, we can calculate the average age. The formula for the average of two numbers is:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Substituting the ages we have:

Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2
Average age = 96 years / 2
Average age = 48 years

So, the average of their ages is 48 years."
"To find out how many good seashells they found together, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve this, let's break it down piece by piece:

1. Avery needs 3 pieces per person, and she's having 12 people. So, she needs 3 * 12 = 36 pieces in total.

2. The dinner plates cost $6.00 each. Since she needs 36 dinner plates, she will spend 36 * $6.00 = $216.00 on dinner plates.

3. The salad plates cost $4.00 each. For 36 salad plates, she will spend 36 * $4.00 = $144.00 on salad plates.

4. The bowls cost $5.00 each. For 36 bowls, she will spend 36 * $5.00 = $180.00 on bowls.

5. Now, let's add up all the costs:
   $216.00 (dinner plates) + $144.00 (salad plates) + $180.00 (bowls) = $540.00

So, Avery will spend $540.00 on place settings."
"Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle. Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time.

First, we find half of Steve's time:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs:

\[
20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, we need to find out how many more hot dogs he needs to buy:

\[
40 \text{ hot dogs needed} - 4 \text{ hot dogs left over} = 36 \text{ hot dogs to buy}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. We divide the number of hot dogs needed by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the packs of hot dogs:

\[
6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, John needs to spend:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate how much money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, the total money she makes is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate how much money Frances spends on buying trays of cookies.

She buys five trays at $4 each:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the amount she spent from the total money she made to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

So, the final amount of money Frances has left is:
\[ \$60 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:** There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street:** Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street:** Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

Now, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract these 5 children from the 30 children:

\[30 - 5 = 25\]

So, the final number of children following the truck is 25.

The final numerical answer is:

First, let's add up the meals given out:
- On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
- On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
- On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Adding these together:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Now, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals she was supposed to distribute:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

"To solve this, let's break down the time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga each week.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation time: 15 minutes

Since she meditates twice a day, the total meditation time per day is:
- 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each week:
- Yoga time: 1 hour (60 minutes)
- She practices yoga 5 days a week

So, the total yoga time per week is:
- 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes

Now, let's add the total meditation and yoga time per week:
- Total weekly time = 30 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 330 minutes

Since we need to find out how much time she spends in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
- Total time in 4 weeks = 330 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1320 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- 1320 minutes / 60 = 22 hours

So, the final numerical answer is:

For medium t-shirts:
8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet each = 32 square feet

For large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet each = 36 square feet

Now, we add them all together:
33 square feet (from small t-shirts) + 32 square feet (from medium t-shirts) + 36 square feet (from large t-shirts) = 101 square feet

So, the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower:

\[ 36 \text{ (small sunflower seeds)} + 54 \text{ (large sunflower seeds)} = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal.

The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, for two T-shirts, the total original price would be:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

With the deal, Jake gets the second T-shirt at 50% off. The price of the second T-shirt is:
\[ 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \]

So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes after the 40% discount.

The original price of the shoes is $40. The discount is 40%, so the price Jake pays is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.40) = 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:

"To find out how much profit Tim makes, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar of the mixture and then find the profit from selling one jar. Finally, we'll multiply the profit from one jar by 10 to get the total profit for 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

Now, let's add up the total cost for one jar:
Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the profit from one jar is:
Profit from one jar = Selling price - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars:
Total profit for 10 jars = Profit from one jar * 10 = $6 * 10 = $60

"First, let's find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Norman High School enrollment} \]

Given that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Now, let's calculate the exact number:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the Butler High School enrollment from the Norman High School enrollment:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Norman High School enrollment} - \text{Butler High School enrollment} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

Now, let's calculate the final numerical answer:

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they've made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 6670
Chocolate chip cookies = 1325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they've made is 1325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the correct quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: Half as many as requested, so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Petri dishes: Two more than requested, so \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- Beakers: Correct number, so 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Total gathered items:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost some items. Let's determine how many items he lost.

The difference between the total gathered items and the items placed on the lab bench:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 items. Since he gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, and placed 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes on the lab bench, the only item he could have lost is one beaker.

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many in the second basket, then the second basket has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's find out how much each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Sarah raised. We know that Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raised $300. So:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can add up the total amount raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and she ran 4 miles, Aaron must have run half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

Now, we know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. If Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles, we can calculate how long it would take Vanessa to run the same distance.

If Aaron runs 2 miles in 16 minutes, then:
- Aaron's speed for 1 mile = 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.
- Since Vanessa runs twice as fast as Aaron, her speed for 1 mile = 8 minutes per mile / 2 = 4 minutes per mile.

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles at her speed of 4 minutes per mile:
- Time taken by Vanessa = 4 miles * 4 minutes per mile = 16 minutes.

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"First, let's calculate how much new line the caretaker needs based on the current dock length.

He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. So for 200 feet of dock, he needs:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

He already has 6 feet of new line. So, the additional line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 594 \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
2. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
3. They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
4. So, the total cost for one night is $10 + $5 = $15.
5. They get 6 reservations, so they make $15 * 6 = $90 in one night.
6. They are open 2 days a week, so they make $90 * 2 = $180 in one week.

The final numerical answer is $180."
"First, let's find out the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The fruit vendor made a 25% profit on the $80 he spent to buy the watermelons.

To calculate the profit, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} \]

Given:
- Cost Price = $80
- Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25 (as a decimal)

So, the profit is:
\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

The total selling price is the cost price plus the profit:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
2. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old now.
4. James is currently 18 years old, and he is 19 years older than his father John, so John is 18 - 19 = -1 years old, which doesn't make sense. This indicates a mistake in the initial setup. Let's correct it.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in one hour.
- Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- Difference = Number of oranges Ana peels - Number of oranges Jane peels = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. So, the discount amount is:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for the mechanic is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set up the equations based on the information given:**
   - Each chicken has 2 legs.
   - Each cow has 4 legs.
   - The total number of animals is 20.
   - The total number of legs is 70.

   From this, we can write the following equations:
   \[
   c + h = 20
   \]
   \[
   2c + 4h = 70
   \]

3. **Simplify the second equation:**
   \[
   2c + 4h = 70
   \]
   Divide the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   c + 2h = 35
   \]

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   We now have:
   \[
   c + h = 20
   \]
   \[
   c + 2h = 35
   \]

   Subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (c + 2h) - (c + h) = 35 - 20
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   h = 15
   \]

5. **Find the number of chickens:**
   Substitute \( h = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   c + 15 = 20
   \]
   Solve for \( c \):
   \[
   c = 5
   \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply 7 by 8:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

So, there are 56 slices of pizza in total.

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes 4 people in total. We divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

The final numerical answer is:

14"
