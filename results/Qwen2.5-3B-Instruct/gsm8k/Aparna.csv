"First, let's determine the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet eats for breakfast. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, the number of eggs left after breakfast is:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Janet also bakes muffins with 4 eggs every day. Therefore, the number of eggs left after baking muffins is:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market. Janet sells each fresh egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe.

1. **Determine the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
   - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bolts:**
   - The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
   - The robe requires 1 bolt of white fiber.
   - Adding these together gives:
     \[
     2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

The initial value of the house is $80,000. Josh invests $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost for the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the initial value of the house:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the initial value of the house gives the new value:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for all sprints:**
   James runs 180 meters in one week for one sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. She has a flock of 20 chickens.

First, we calculate the total feed given in the morning:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed given in the afternoon:
\[ 25 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the morning and afternoon feed amounts to find the total feed given in the first two meals:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we need to find out how much feed each chicken receives in the first two meals:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cups}}{20 \text{ chickens}} = 2 \text{ cups per chicken} \]

Each chicken receives 2 cups of feed in the morning and 2 cups in the afternoon, totaling 4 cups of feed in the first two meals.

To find out how much feed each chicken receives in the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the first two meals from the total feed per chicken:
\[ 3 \text{ cups per chicken} - 4 \text{ cups per chicken} = -1 \text{ cup per chicken} \]

Since the calculation shows a negative value, it indicates that the total feed given in the first two meals (40 cups) is already more than the total feed needed for the entire flock (60 cups, since each chicken needs 3 cups per day).

Therefore, the final meal does not require any additional feed for the entire flock, as the total feed given in the first two meals already exceeds the daily requirement for all chickens.

Thus, the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ 0 \text{ cups} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: one glass costs $5, and every second glass costs only 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's break down the cost for every second glass:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can pair them up into 8 pairs. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

So, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by determining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the restart download: 60 minutes

Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Distance covered: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Her earnings for the overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are:
\[ \$460 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year}
\]

Since the initial cost of $90 is greater than the net profit of $7.5 per year, Carlos will not start earning money in the first year. We need to determine the number of years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost.

Let \( n \) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
n \times \$7.5
\]

We need this total net profit to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90:
\[
n \times \$7.5 \geq \$90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n \geq \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \).

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).

We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's simplify the equation step by step:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x - x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. Let's verify this:

1. She sold \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, leaving her with \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) vacuum cleaners, leaving her with \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) vacuum cleaners.

Since the final number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, our solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

2. **Remaining Students After Contemporary Dance:**
   - Total students - Students in contemporary dance = \(20 - 4 = 16\) students.

3. **Jazz Dance Enrollment:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = \(0.25 \times 16 = 4\) students.

4. **Remaining Students After Jazz Dance:**
   - Remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance = \(16 - 4 = 12\) students.

5. **Hip-Hop Dance Enrollment:**
   - The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 12 students.

6. **Percentage of Students Enrolled in Hip-Hop Dance:**
   - Percentage of students in hip-hop dance = \(\frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\%\).

Thus, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + $125
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,096

Now, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000
- Profit from jewelry = $125

- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125. 

The final numerical answer is $125."

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ \$700/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$35,000/\text{year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ \$450/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$22,500/\text{year} \]

Finally, her total annual salary is the sum of her annual earnings from teaching and coaching:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
  \]

Now, we add the amounts of water from both drinks:
\[
\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water remains the same, which is:
\[
\frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
\]

To find the concentration of water in the remaining 9 liters, we use the ratio of water to the total volume:
\[
\text{Concentration of water} = \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{9} = \frac{47}{27} \approx 1.74 \text{ liters per liter}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is:
\[
9 \times \frac{47}{27} = \frac{423}{27} = 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[
\boxed{15.67}

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Then we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{26.00}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of 243 dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 60 days in the period she is buying ice cream.

\[
\text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream.

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between his first stop (20 miles) and his second stop (45 miles). This can be calculated as:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

\[
\boxed{104}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Next, we find the average by dividing the total by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. So, the total time spent on one dog per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

70"

1. **Determine how many jewels Aaron has:**
   - We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. **Determine how many jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 23."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Adding the points from both periods, we get:

4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sets of 4 yogurts in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   Each set costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much money John has left after buying the video games. We know he has $5 left after these purchases.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John has $5 left after spending $160 on video games, the $35 he has left is indeed correct.

Finally, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Initially, he had 13 lego sets, and he sold all of them. Therefore, he does not have any lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week, and the times he runs are as follows:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours
- Third day: half as much as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his average speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

To find the walking speed, we use the fact that Dana's walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she runs and walks:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Given:
- Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
- With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

First, we calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance with gemstone} = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = \text{Distance with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance outside reach} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"

"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of making the candles:**
   - Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for each 10 candles.
   - For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Total cost = $20.00
   - Total revenue = $40.00
   - Therefore, the net profit is:

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \) articles on Tuesday.
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \]
So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:

"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of post-it notes she had before purchasing the new package is the sum of the initial post-it notes and the post-it notes in the new package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 post-it notes and having 23 remaining, the equation representing the total number of post-it notes is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( 163 \)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

\[
\text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[
\text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
\text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday, we need to calculate the total charges for each day.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each charged at $60.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each charged at $40.

First, calculate the revenue from truck tires:
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360 \]

Next, calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160 \]

Now, add the revenues from both types of tires to find the total revenue for Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each charged at $40.

Calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480 \]

Now, add the revenue from car tires to find the total revenue for Friday:
\[ \$480 \]

**Comparison of Revenue:**
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Thus, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is $50,000 per year.

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - The total pension for the first 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - The total pension for the next 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.
   - Total pension after 30 years = $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000.

4. **Annual pension after 30 years:**
   - Since she is entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000.

Therefore, the annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years is $50,000."

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year:
- The puppy will live for the rest of its life, and we need to determine how much dog food is required for the remaining days in the first year.
- There are 365 days in a year, and the puppy has already consumed 180 days of dog food.
- Therefore, the remaining days in the first year are:
  \[
  365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days}
  \]
- The puppy will eat 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
  \[
  2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}
  \]

Now, add the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:

So, Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2 = 4 * 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights:

Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final numerical answer is 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Also, the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won:
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15."
"Gene is 34 years old now and he has been vacationing since he was 23. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each subsequent vacation, he adds another quilt block. Since he goes on four vacations each year, the number of quilt blocks from each year forms a row. Therefore, for each of the 11 years, he has 4 quilt blocks (one from each vacation). 

So, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 years * 4 quilt blocks/year = 44 quilt blocks.

The final numerical answer is 44."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the duration of each ring and then sum them up.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Therefore, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from each instance:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase Policy**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed in the company for five years.

3. **First Year of Increase**: After the first year of service, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of $600.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 600 = 60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 600 + 60 = 660
   \]

4. **Second Year of Increase**: After the second year of service, Sylvie's salary will again increase by 10% of $660.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 660 = 66

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, let's determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. 

To find out how many guests don't show up, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 guests don't show up. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. Since 12 guests are attending, the total number of gift bags required is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

\[
\boxed{225}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets the three have, we add the number of pets each one has:

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 6 pets.
- Jan has 18 pets.

So, the total number of pets is \(4 + 6 + 18 = 28\).

The final numerical answer is 28."
"Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
- Amy's age = \( A \)
- Jackson's age = \( J \)
- Corey's age = \( C \)
- James' age = \( M \)

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 years old: \( M = 10 \)
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = C - 1 \)

Since we know James' age is 10, we can substitute \( M = 10 \) into the fourth equation:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now we know Corey's age is 11. Using the second piece of information, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now we know Amy's age is 9. Using the first piece of information, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Calculate Lee's original speed:**
   Since Lee's time is 38 seconds, his speed is:
   \[
   \text{Lee's speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine the original time for Gerald:**
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, Gerald's original time was:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate Gerald's original speed:**
   Using Gerald's original time, his speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's original speed} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   Gerald improved his speed by 10%. Therefore, his improved speed is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's improved speed} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \times 1.10 = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's improved time:**
   Using his improved speed, Gerald's new time to run the 400-meter hurdles is:
   \[
   \text{Gerald's improved time} = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Dogs**: Given that there are 60 dogs.
2. **Number of Cats**: Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. **Number of Rabbits**: The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\). Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

The total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. 

Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we calculate:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."

"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first sum up the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading after reading 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the number of pages he needs to read in the remaining 4 days is:

Pages to read in remaining days = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
Pages to read in remaining days = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

To find out how many pages he needs to read, on average, in one day over the next 4 days, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Pages to read in remaining days / Number of days
Average pages per day = 24 / 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks water with each meal on weekdays (Monday to Friday). Since he drinks one glass of water with each meal, and he has three meals a day, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays. Therefore, for 5 weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he drinks a soda with dinner instead of water. So, he drinks 0 glasses of water on each of the weekend days. Therefore, for 2 weekend days, he drinks:
\[ 0 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 0 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 0 \text{ glasses} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry meant to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, which is \( 2x \). However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he baked \( x + 15 \) cookies. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, and he now has 110 cookies. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 \]

So, Henry meant to bake 100 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he meant to, the number of cookies he baked last year is:

\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. Therefore, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we calculate the number of 10-foot segments in 80 feet:

\[ \text{Number of 10-foot segments} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet per segment}} = 8 \]

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for each 10-foot segment, the total amount of water taken on is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the leftover lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the leftover lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit Sasha makes by selling the leftover lumber.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total parts is sugar. Since sugar makes up 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\).

We can now calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used by multiplying the total amount of sugar and water by the fraction that represents the sugar:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = 120 \times \frac{7}{20} = 120 \times 0.35 = 42
\]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of vehicles initially at the port.
2. Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Determine the number of containers imported on the second day.

Initially, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's, and assuming the same percentage increase, Lylah's new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \text{ (approximately)}
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Friday, so she slept \(8 + 1 = 9\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Saturday, so she slept \(9 + 1 = 10\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
\[ 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 6 = 20 \]
\[ 20 + 7 = 27 \]
\[ 27 + 8 = 35 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
2. Calculate the distance Rosie runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first part:
- Speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time: 3 hours
- Distance = Speed * Time = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Next, we need to find out how much time is left after the first 3 hours:
- Total time available: 7 hours
- Time already used: 3 hours
- Remaining time: 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

Now, we calculate the distance for the second part:
- Speed: 5 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed * Time = 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Finally, we add the distances from both parts to get the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
- Total distance = Distance from first part + Distance from second part = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50 miles."

"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew, so she had \( x - 3 \) spoons left.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she then had \( x - 3 + 5 = x + 2 \) spoons.

We know that after setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons.

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper:**
   Given that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of an orange:**
   An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   \[

"To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients.

First, let's calculate the revenue from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the fraction of an hour each patient is seen is \( \frac{24}{60} = \frac{2}{5} \) of an hour.

The doctors charge $150 per hour:
- Revenue from each patient = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 150 = 60 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for each patient:
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- Cost for each patient = $200.

Now, we can calculate the profit for each patient:
- Profit per patient = Revenue - Cost = $60 - $200 = -$140.

Since the profit per patient is negative, the hospital incurs a loss of $140 per patient.

Finally, we need to find the total profit for 500 patients:
- Total profit = 500 patients \(\times\) (-$140) = -$70,000.

Thus, the hospital's profit from these visits is \(-$70,000\)."

\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares John has:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2125 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Debra sees 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Debra sees twice as many bees leave as she saw leave in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee returns in the last 6 hours:** All the bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods (30 bees initially and 60 bees later) return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours. The bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours are the ones that return in the last 6 hours.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is the sum of the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the bees that left in the next 6 hours:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So we set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is 4 minutes."
"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**

   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[ 250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, and after that, 5 fries were left.

Let's calculate the remaining fries step by step:

- After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
- After the seagull ate 7 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
- After the pigeons ate 9 fries, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
- After the raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, one third of the remaining fries are left, which is \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
- According to the problem, after the raccoon, 5 fries were left, so we have:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 5
  \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x - 30 = 15 \implies x = 45
  \]

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( 45 \).

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then sum these amounts over the 16 weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- There are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
- So, the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- There are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday).
- So, the total number of hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one week:
- The total number of hours per week is the sum of the hours on the three days and the two days, which is \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \times 16 = 272 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{272}

"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls = \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - First, convert feet to inches: \( 2 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Total length of baguettes = \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum up the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
  \[
  15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).
- Kelly does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
  \[
  34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}
  \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distances they run is:
\[
3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The price increases by 20% every two months. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Price after 2 months**: The price increases by 20% of $20.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 20 + 4 = 24
   \]
3. **Price after 4 months**: The price increases by 20% of $24.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 24 \times 0.20 = 4.8
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 24 + 4.8 = 28.8
   \]
4. **Price after 6 months**: The price increases by 20% of $28.8.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 28.8 \times 0.20 = 5.76
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56
   \]
5. **Price after 8 months**: The price increases by 20% of $34.56.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 34.56 \times 0.20 = 6.912
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 34.56 + 6.912 = 41.472
   \]
6. **Price after 10 months**: The price increases by 20% of $41.472.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 41.472 \times 0.20 = 8.2944
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 41.472 + 8.2944 = 49.7664
   \]
7. **Price after 12 months**: The price increases by 20% of $49.7664.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 49.7664 \times 0.20 = 9.95328
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 49.7664 + 9.95328 = 59.71968
   \]

We can see that the price increases by 20% every two months. To generalize, after \( n \) two-month periods, the price will be:
\[
\text{New Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^n
\]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we substitute \( n = 18 \):
\[
\text{New Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
\]

Thus, the new price is:
\[
\text{New Price} = 20 \times 10.488 = 209.76
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[
\boxed{209.76}
\]"
"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

   - Each red car costs $4.
   - Total cost for red cars = 5 cars * $4/car = $20.

2. **Action Figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost for action figures = 3 figures * $5/figure = $15.

3. **Doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost for 3 action figures = 3 figures * $5/figure = $15.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we sum up the values of all the toys:
- Total value = Value of red cars + Value of action figures + Value of doll
- Total value = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The final numerical answer is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income:
- Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.

Missed income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Next, we compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
- The accountant charges $90.

Since the missed income ($105) is greater than the cost of hiring the accountant ($90), Jackie will have less money if she hires the accountant.

The difference in money between the missed income and the cost of hiring the accountant is:
- Missed income: $105
- Cost of hiring the accountant: $90

Difference = $105 - $90 = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Caboose}
\]

Since the problem states there are four birds at the Caboose, and we don't have any specific information about the age of the Caboose, we assume the Caboose is also 8 years old (same as Sally Four, as no other information is given).

\[
\text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds:
1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to prep 60 potatoes:
- Time to prep one potato: 95 seconds
- Number of potatoes: 60

Multiply the time per potato by the number of potatoes:
95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
5700 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit is:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15
     \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast is 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

According to the problem:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 200 = 5w \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 200 = 5w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( w = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Jan's Age**: Jan is 30 years old.
2. **Mark's Age Two Years Ago**: Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. According to the problem, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of 28.
   \[
   \text{Half of Jan's age two years ago} = \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]
   \[
   \text{Mark's age two years ago} = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
   Therefore, Mark's current age is:
   \[
   19 + 2 = 21
   \]
3. **Jean's Age**: Jean is two years older than Mark.
   \[
   \text{Jean's age} = 21 + 2 = 23

"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are four members.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in time between the two teams:
- Time difference = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in the probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

The final numerical answer is 30."
"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

Given:
- There are 3 cages of rats, each with \( r \) rats.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 1 hamster.
- Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 1 \text{ hamster per cage} \times 5 \text{ pieces of straw per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:
\[ 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats per cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces of straw per rat} = 18r \text{ pieces of straw} \]

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the hamsters, the rabbits, and the rats:
\[ 50 + 20 + 18r = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 70 + 18r = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

Therefore, the total cost for the trader is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at a rate of $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by 3.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:
- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The total cost of tickets and food is $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides:
- They went on 2 rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.00.

Now, let's find the total expenses:
- The total expenses are the sum of the cost of tickets, food, and rides, which is $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Finally, we need to divide the total expenses by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted each year**: Tom plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: We need to calculate the number of trees after 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees added over 10 years:
\[
8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
\]

Next, add the trees added over 10 years to the initial number of trees:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total payment from both publishers.

First, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher A each week, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Since Mark edits 1000 sentences for Publisher B each week, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.
   - He used 8 slices of cheese in the dish.

Now, we sum up all the cheese slices used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

- Red pens: 12

Total number of pens:

\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 98 \]"
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Therefore, the total sum of the six test scores needed is:
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. We subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score needed on the sixth test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Thus, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

- Total kilometers in one week: \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Total kilometers in four weeks: \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in one week: \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Total kilometers in three weeks: \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total kilometers:**
- Sum of the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks: \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \text{ cakes}
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given:

1. Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
- Half a dozen plates means 6 plates.
- Each plate costs $6000.
- Therefore, the total cost for 6 plates is:
  \[
  6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than this total cost:
- Twenty dozen cups means 240 cups.
- Let the cost of each cup be \( x \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for 240 cups is:
  \[
  240x \text{ dollars}
  \]

According to the problem, the total cost of 240 cups is $1200 less than the total cost of 6 plates:
\[
240x = 36000 - 1200
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
240x = 34800
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 240:
\[
x = \frac{34800}{240}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
x = 145
\]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[
\boxed{145}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining money.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the additional money she needs to earn is \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars.

Let's denote the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn as \(x\). Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, the total money she earns from mowing the lawn is \(4x\). We need this to be equal to the additional money she needs to earn, which is $60. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[4x = 60\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{60}{4} = 15\]

So, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Total eggs collected:

\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
3. Find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's recheck the setup with the correct interpretation:

From \( B = 4S \) and \( B = 2S - 16 \), we have:
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus an additional 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes in the number of cards.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards, the number of water type cards becomes:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

After buying 14 new grass type cards, the number of grass type cards becomes:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \]

The total number of cards after these changes is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The number of water type cards is now 32. The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

"To determine how much Chad still owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his burrito and then subtract the value of his gift card.

First, let's calculate the cost of the burrito with all the additions:
- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 sauces cost $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:

   - Fraction ready for harvest: \( \frac{3}{4} \)
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \)

4. **Determine the number of watermelons remaining after the second harvest:**
   - Remaining watermelons after first harvest: 84
   - Watermelons ready for harvest after second harvest: 63
   - Watermelons remaining: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \)

5. **Find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks:**
   - Watermelons remaining: 21

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark also needs to pay $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, Kylie collects \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

2. Calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. Determine the total number of penguins that leave the snow to either swim or go into the cave:
   \[
   12 \text{ (jumping in) } + 12 \text{ (going into the cave) } = 24
   \]

4. Subtract the number of penguins that left from the total number of penguins to find out how many are still sunbathing:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"To determine how many tomato vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the problem, one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce per week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 tomato vines. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required.

John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process Ram uses to make new pens from the empty ones. Ram can make one full pen by mixing the ink from five empty pens. 

First, Ram buys 25 pens. Since he can make one full pen from five empty pens, he can initially make:
\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]
full pens from the 25 empty pens he bought.

After using these 5 full pens, he will have 20 empty pens left (since he started with 25 and used 5). Now, he can make another set of full pens from these 20 empty pens:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]
full pens.

After using these 4 full pens, he will have 15 empty pens left. Now, he can make another set of full pens from these 15 empty pens:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]
full pens.

After using these 3 full pens, he will have 10 empty pens left. Now, he can make another set of full pens from these 10 empty pens:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]
full pens.

After using these 2 full pens, he will have 5 empty pens left. Now, he can make another set of full pens from these 5 empty pens:
\[ \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]
full pen.

After using this 1 full pen, he will have 0 empty pens left. 

Now, we sum up all the full pens he has made:
\[ 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start by determining the ages of each girl based on the information given.

1. **Jessa's Age:**
   Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Joan's Age:**
   Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Mary's Age:**
   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we add the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Let's perform the addition:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of students**: 1000.

2. **Students exiting through exit A**: 30% of 1000.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

3. **Remaining students after exit A**: 
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

4. **Students exiting through exit B**: \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students exited through exit B.

5. **Remaining students after exit B**: 
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

6. **Students exiting through exit C**: The rest of the students.
   \[
   280

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has:
     \[
     \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

2. **Determine the number of candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has:
     \[
     \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

3. **Determine how many more candies John has than James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - Therefore, the difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used in a month:
- Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes used for his boss's calls is:
  \[
  15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Additionally, Jason has used 300 extra minutes with other people this month.

So, the total number of minutes Jason has used is:
\[
450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
\]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes he has left is:
\[
1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{250}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2f) \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Now, solve for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * 5 weeks

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = Total hours worked * $250/hour

Finally, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost to find out how much Jean pays.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total hours worked = 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours
2. Total cost before discount = 120 * $250 = $30,000
3. Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000
4. Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

So, Jean paid $27,000."

- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split the total cost evenly among her three parents. Therefore, we need to divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

So, each person paid $32.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Sue and her sister ate over the two days and then convert that into calories.

First, let's determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we convert the total number of cookies into calories. Each cookie has 200 calories:
- Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]
- Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the third class. Let's break down the information given:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls.
5. The second class has 12 girls.

First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
\[ \text{Total students} = 3 \text{ classes} \times 20 \text{ students/class} = 60 \text{ students} \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- First class has 15 girls.
- Second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 \text{ girls} + 12 \text{ girls} = 27 \text{ girls} \]

Now, we can find the number of girls in the third class:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the third class} = 30 \text{ girls (total)} - 27 \text{ girls (first and second classes)} = 3 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \text{Number of boys in the third class} = 20 \text{ students} - 3 \text{ girls} = 17 \text{ boys} \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.
   - The number of cougars killed yesterday was 15, so today he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.
   - Thus, \( c = 12 \).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Wolves killed yesterday: 10
   - Wolves killed today: 36
   - Cougars killed yesterday: 15
   - Cougars killed today: 12

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cows Mr. Sylas has after buying 40 cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows he has now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_a = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

First, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

We know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[ \text{Cups of flour needed} = \left( \frac{66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \right) \times 2 \text{ cups} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{66}{12} = 5.5 \]

Then, multiplying by 2 cups:
\[ 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need:
\[ 11 \text{ cups of flour} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given:
- Total number of pennies in the cup = 9,300

We need to find two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
\]

First, perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Next, we need to convert the number of pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:
\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6,200 \text{ pennies}}{100 \text{ pennies per dollar}} = 62 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the stack is:
\[
\boxed{62}

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Given: 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \( 0.4 \times 20 = 8 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \( 28 - 5 = 23 \) minutes.

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start by defining their current ages. Let's denote Mico's current age as \( m \) and Marco's current age as \( r \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20. This can be written as:

\[ m + r = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( m + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( r + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (m + 10) + (r + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

\[ m + r + 10 + 10 = m + r + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem statement that \( m + r = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the expression:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:
\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula for time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - The total number of medals given out is \(10 \times 39 = 390\).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we need to distribute these remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

1. Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.
2. She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.
3. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in minutes is 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.
4. Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 15 intervals.
5. Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $75."
"To determine the total points of Mike, Jim, and Tony after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Mike's points:**
   - Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.

2. **Calculate Jim's points:**
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - Jim's points: \( 21 - 3 = 18 \) points.

3. **Calculate Tony's points:**
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
   - Tony's points: \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \) points.

4. **Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

5. **Calculate the total points after the extra point is distributed:**
   - Mike's total points: \( 21 + 0 = 21 \)
   - Jim's total points: \( 18 + 0 = 18 \)
   - Tony's total points: \( 42 + 1 = 43 \)

6. **Sum the total points of all three players:**
   - Total points: \( 21 + 18 + 43 = 82 \)

Thus, the total points of all three players after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."

- Squats: 90
- Dumbbell presses: 60
- Total: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final numerical answer is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the 5 members of the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the 5 members of the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 2 meals (lunch and dinner) per day, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

With 5 members, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/day/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The second person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The third person bids $250 + $50 = $300.
   - Carmen's third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The fourth person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Carmen's total expenditure is the sum of her bids:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 \]

Let's calculate this sum:
\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \]
\[ 350 + 400 = 750 \]
\[ 500 + 750 = 1250 \]

Thus, the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk is:
\[ \boxed{1250} \]"
"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day.
- Therefore, he drives \(30 + 30 = 60\) miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.
- So, the total miles driven in a year is \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost per mile is $2.
- Therefore, the cost for 15000 miles is \(15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- The driver gets a $150 bonus per month.
- There are 50 weeks in a year, so there are \(50 \text{ weeks/year} \times 4 \text{ months/week} = 200 \text{ months/year}\).
- Therefore, the total bonus is \(200 \text{ months/year} \times 150 \text{ dollars/month} = 30000 \text{ dollars}\).

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year:
- The total amount John pays a year is \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 30000 \text{ dollars} = 60000 \text{ dollars}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60000}

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we add this bonus to his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he arm wrestled.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is 4."
"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
2. Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we have:
\[ \text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

Next, we determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:
\[ \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 1 week), we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \text{ weeks} \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the original prices versus the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Therefore, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the discounted prices is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every three days.
   - We need to find out how many times three days fit into fifteen days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every five days.
   - We need to find out how many times five days fit into fifteen days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- Total cost for business suits = 6 * $100 = $600.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- Total cost for suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket:
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- Cost of a business suit = $100.
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500.
- Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
- Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo has $6000 to spend on his trip and wishes to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip is:
- Amount to spend = Total money - Savings
- Amount to spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Finally, let's calculate how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners:
- Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total cost of items
- Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

The final numerical answer is $2050."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

2. **Calculate Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

The final numerical answer is 240000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is \(8 \div 4 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final numerical answer is 14."

The final numerical answer is 156 kg."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 \]

Perform the multiplication:

\[ 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people in total left, and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people must have been women.

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together make up 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 24 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we can calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Adding the pencils Meg has, we get:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of the cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much stronger the drink is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we can use the given ratio of trading old records for new ones. According to the problem, 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can set up the following equation based on the trading ratio:

\[ \text{Number of new records} = \frac{\text{Number of old records brought in}}{2} \]

We know the number of new records is 7, so we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 7 = \frac{\text{Number of old records brought in}}{2} \]

To find the number of old records brought in, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Number of old records brought in} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Thus, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Number of junior programmers = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\)
- Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Next, we know the monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000.

The salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer:
- Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:
- Total salary for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of a junior programmer
- Total salary for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:
- Total salary for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Salary of a senior programmer
- Total salary for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000

Finally, we add the total salaries of junior and senior programmers to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:
- Total monthly salary = Total salary for junior programmers + Total salary for senior programmers
- Total monthly salary = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

According to the problem, at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more the phone needs to be charged to reach 100% and then calculate the time required based on the given rate.

1. The phone is currently at 60% charged.
2. The phone needs to be charged to 100%, which means it needs to be charged by 40 percentage points (100% - 60% = 40%).

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ \text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]"
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.
3. Apply the coupon to the discounted price.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[ \text{Rewards} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.**

The customer spent $43 on their current shopping trip. They can use the $4 in rewards to reduce the price. The new price after applying the rewards is:
\[ \text{New Price} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the coupon to the discounted price.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon will take off:
\[ \text{Coupon Discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The final price after applying the coupon is:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

### Job A:
1. **Gross Pay**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **State Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

### Job B:
1. **Gross Pay**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Pay Before Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Net Pay After Property Tax**: 90% of $36,000 (since 10% is the tax rate on net income after property tax) = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A: $24,000
- Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job."

"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

Total cost for Furniture United:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Advance payment} + (\text{Number of installments} \times \text{Installment amount}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1350 + (6 \times 350) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1350 + 2100 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3450 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Price Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after increase} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value of Shares at the End of the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Value at the end of the first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:
\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

3. **Weight of the Green Toad:**
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Weight of the Yellow Snake:**
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.
   - Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.

5. **Weight of the Red Bird:**
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

"To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days) in June.

First, let's find the additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:

\[ \text{Total distance per day} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days):

\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without any discount.
The cost of one shirt is $30, so the cost of 2 shirts is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so the discount amount on the total cost of $60 is:
\[ 60 \times \frac{40}{100} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors when they made tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos now that they make silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out what percentage more they are making per day now compared to when they made tractors, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Amount} - \text{Old Amount}}{\text{Old Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:

\[ 10\% \]

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for food, treats, and medicine, we get \( 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \) dollars per month.

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 months.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is \( 220 \times 12 = 2640 \) dollars.

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga class.
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: half the duration of the cooking class.
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
2. Calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses.
3. Subtract the number of plant pots already bought from the total number of plant pots needed.

First, we know that April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies. The number of plant pots needed for the roses is twice the number needed for the daisies:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of plant pots needed for both daisies and roses:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she already bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming.

Boating time: 6 hours
Swimming time: half of boating time, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours

Total time for boating and swimming: \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) hours

Next, let's calculate the total time he spent watching the shows.

Number of shows: 3
Duration of each show: 2 hours
Total time for shows: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) hours.

We know that this 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let's denote the total time spent on all activities as \( T \).

So, \( 0.30 \times T = 15 \) hours

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Let's calculate the time spent sightseeing.

Time spent sightseeing: \( 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \) hours

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle will earn from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she will earn from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she will earn from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs, we subtract the total amount she will have from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of the second tree.
2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the height of the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the shortest tree} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the second tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, we determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars Dean bought. Each toy car costs $2, and he bought 6 of them:

\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears Dean bought. Each teddy bear costs $1, and he bought 5 of them:

\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears to find the total amount Dean spent:

\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10:

\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is:

\[ \$21 \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mini-golf:
- Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf.
- The cost of one round of mini-golf is $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the arcade tokens:
- Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the go-karts:
- Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice.
- The cost of one go-kart ride is $10.
- Therefore, the cost for two go-kart rides is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Cost of mini-golf: $5
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5
- Cost of go-karts: $20

Total cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Morgan's total budget is $90. To find out how much money is left after these expenses, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Remaining budget = $90 - $30 = $60

Since Morgan wants to invite friends and she already has herself included, the remaining budget of $60 will be used for her friends. Each friend will get $10 (since the cost of one go-kart ride is $10).

To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
- Number of friends = $60 / $10 = 6

Therefore, Morgan can invite 6 friends to her birthday party.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the lollipops.
2. Determine the daily change Marisa saves.
3. Calculate the total savings over 5 days.

First, let's find the daily cost of the lollipops:
- Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents.

The total cost of the lollipops per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Marisa saves each day. Since she gets $5 as pocket money every day, we convert this to cents:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

The daily change she saves is:
\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents} = 400 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings over 5 days:
\[ 400 \text{ cents per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we convert the total savings back to dollars:
\[ 2000 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

The total amount spent on gumballs is $2. Therefore, the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is 5.3333 pounds. Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is \(100 - 50 = 50\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[675 \div 18000 = 0.0375\]

Since the train needs service every 18,000 miles, it will go between services after 18,000 miles of travel. To find out how many days this corresponds to, we divide 18,000 miles by the distance traveled in one day:
\[18000 \div 675 = 26.6667\]

Since the train needs service at the end of 18,000 miles, it will go between services after 27 days (since it starts service after 26 full days of travel).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[27\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}

1. **Trip to his friend's house:**
   - Distance: 200 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.8571 hours

2. **Detour:**
   - Additional distance: 10 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Additional distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.1429 hours

3. **Trip back home:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we sum the times for all segments:
- Time to friend's house: 2.8571 hours

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on her third test. The equation for the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is:
\[ 4x - 5 \]
Substituting \( x = 3 \):
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:

Now, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5475 \]

Since Karan has to pay this total amount back over 5 months, the amount she has to pay per month is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 kilometers

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Axel has:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos.

Next, let's calculate the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has:

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's find the total number of silver pesos they have together:

- Axel has 50 silver pesos.
- Anna has 100 silver pesos.
- Total silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\).

Next, let's find the total number of gold pesos they have together:

- Axel has 80 gold pesos.
- Anna has 120 gold pesos.
- Total gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\).

Finally, let's find the total number of pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos = 150.
- Total gold pesos = 200.
- Total pesos = \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The final numerical answer is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies, so the cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.50 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:
\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:
\[
x = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26.

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30.
- The ride bracelet gives him 9 rides.

Since David gets all 9 rides for $30, the cost per ride for David is:
\[ \frac{30}{9} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Dasha buys tickets to ride all 9 rides.
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.

So, the cost for one ride for Dasha is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars per ride} \]

Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars per ride} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the total costs for David and Dasha:
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets is:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 6 = 11\).

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each person has by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio.

\[
\text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15
\]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:

\[
\text{Number of popsicles Betty has} = 5 \times 15 = 75
\]
\[
\text{Number of popsicles Sam has} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[
\text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all the time Carol spends on each activity into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording it: half of the time spent writing it = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing it: 90 minutes

Next, we'll calculate the total time spent on all activities:

Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Now, we'll find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:

Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100

Let's calculate the percentage:

Percentage spent editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, the final numerical answer is 20%."

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- 2 zebras with 17 stripes each
- 1 zebra with 36 stripes
- 1 zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes

Let's calculate the total number of stripes:

\[
2 \times 17 + 36 + 18
\]

First, calculate \( 2 \times 17 \):

\[
2 \times 17 = 34
\]

Next, add the stripes of the other zebras:

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Number of cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100
   \]
3. **Initial number of corns**: The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Since initially there are 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[
     6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} - 10 \text{ employees} = 30 \text{ employees}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in June:
     \[
     4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in both May and June:**
   - Total amount paid in May: $96000
   - Total amount paid in June: $72000
   - Total amount paid in both months:
     \[
     96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars}

Thus, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets, so the cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the cost of the seashells and magnets to find the total amount spent:
$4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks gives the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 5 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of dangerous candles:
   \[
   \text{Total dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500
   \]

2. Calculate the number of dangerous candles that do not have the defect (smell like wet dog):
   \[
   \text{Dangerous candles without defect} = 99\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.99 \times 2500 = 2475
   \]

3. Calculate the number of dangerous candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog):
   \[
   \text{Dangerous candles with defect} = 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125
   \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 125.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

Subtract the discount amount from the regular price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the discounted blouses is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( J_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( J_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( J_{\text{avg}} \). According to the problem, Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).

The number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees is half the number she gathers from the tallest trees, so \( J_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( J_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any apples from the average trees, so she gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ J_{\text{tall}} + J_{\text{short}} + J_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + J_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + J_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
Solving for \( J_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ J_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \( \boxed{350} \)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( c \) in terms of \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( c \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ -d = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -d = -56 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To find the number of camels, we substitute \( d = 56 \) back into the equation \( c = 180 - d \):
\[ c = 180 - 56 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

To verify, we check the total number of humps:
\[ 2c + d = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of dromedaries is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next two days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - Distance traveled in the next two days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
- First 4 days: \( 800 \text{ km} \)
- Next two days: \( 240 \text{ km} \)
- Next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \)
- Second week: \( 2100 \text{ km} \)

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts received from both banks.
3. Add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we sum the amounts received from both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which means a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. Therefore, the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is the normal price of $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

3. **Next 8 months (months 9 to 16):**
   - The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

4. **Next 4 months (months 17 to 20):**
   - The cost is the increased price of $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 4 months = 4 months * $14/month = $56.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $112 (next 8 months) + $56 (next 4 months).
- Total cost = $48 + $24 + $112 + $56 = $240.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $240."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips. We know that George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left after buying the chips and candy bars. This means that 99% of his $5 was spent on chips and candy bars.

99% of $5 is calculated as:
\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars. We know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

The soup serves 6 people, so we divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving:

$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Wayne's travel time to the theater is given as 4 minutes.
2. The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the travel time from Bernadette's apartment to the theater is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time to arrive at the same time as Wayne.

Thus, Bernadette should leave \(4 - 5 = -1\) minutes before Wayne. Since leaving 1 minute before Wayne would mean she arrives 5 minutes before him, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne.

The final numerical answer is 1."
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To determine the final temperature of the house, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   Marcus wakes up and the house is at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking:**
   Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Temperature increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   \text{Temperature after baking} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window:**
   Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature decrease} = 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   \text{Final temperature} = 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. 

To find the distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 32 miles per hour
- Time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

So,
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. According to the problem, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile.

So,
\[ \text{Bails of hay} = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we need to find the total cost of 8 bails of hay. Given that each bail costs $3:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost from the amount he has:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is:
\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses that can be made is:
\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

Thus, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score: 214 points
Points scored by Joey: 26 points
Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score: 225 points

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining number of sneakers is:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

These 31 sneakers were sold to the department store for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling all the sneakers:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from the two types of packets separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each have eight pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each have sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall total number of crayons:

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and one popcorn and one soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying the movie ticket and the individual items. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 13 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

1. **Calculate the initial cost per balloon:**
   - Total cost for 20 balloons = $900
   - Initial cost per balloon = \(\frac{900}{20} = 45\) dollars

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon:**

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second segment, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Therefore, she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires left} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the remaining sapphires. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 5 remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the value of the rubies Jenna receives. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for his raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions:
- Width: 2 feet
- Length: 8 feet
- Height: 2 feet

The volume of one raised bed is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags required is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the fairies that were there. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there.
3. The total number of fairies after the 25 new fairies joined is:
   \[
   50 + 25 = 75
   \]
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feeds to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):

"To determine the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. **Shoes received on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he receives \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
3. **Shoes received on Wednesday**: He gains 15 pairs of shoes. This means he receives \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
4. **Shoes received on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes. This means he receives \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.
5. **Total shoes received**: Adding the shoes received on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, we get \(10 + 30 + 60 = 100\) shoes.
6. **Total shoes before Saturday**: Adding the initial number of shoes to the total received, we get \(200 + 100 = 300\) shoes.
7. **Shoes lost on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. Subtracting these from the total, we get \(300 - 180 = 120\) shoes.

Thus, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils.
   \[
   \text{Total initial pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   After two months, \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the total pencils were used.
   \[
   \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining pencils after two months are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240
   \]

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   At the end of the year, only \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining pencils were left.
   \[
   \text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).

We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (allergic to both)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| \]

Substituting the value of \( |A \cup B| \):
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the cheerleaders and then calculate the total height of the human pyramid.

First, let's find the average height of the cheerleaders. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The average height can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{9 \times 64 + 1 \times 60}{10} = \frac{576 + 60}{10} = \frac{636}{10} = 63.6 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total height of the human pyramid. The pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on the next level, 2 girls on the next level, and 1 girl at the top. The total number of girls in the pyramid is:

\[
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10
\]

Since the average height of each cheerleader is 63.6 inches, the total height of the pyramid is:

\[
10 \times 63.6 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

For the second venue, the total cost \( C_2 \) is:
\[ C_2 = 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 30n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides by 25:
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} \]
\[ n = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and then add the additional gifts she bought for a surprise.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her 5 friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Next, Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise.

Adding the gifts for her friends and the surprise gifts together:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug's width is \(3 + 5 = 8\) feet.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug's width is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) feet. Therefore, the couch is \(16 + 2 = 18\) feet long.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). According to the problem, Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2 and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.

The total cost of the gum can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of using 2 x 4 pieces of wood versus 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 4 = $4
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 4 = 200
  - Cost per stick = $4 / 200 = $0.02 per stick

- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood:
  - Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
  - Number of sticks from 2 x 8 = 400
  - Cost per stick = $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, Frederick should use as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible within his budget of $24.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
- Cost of 2 x 8 = $6
- Total budget = $24
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

Next, we calculate the total number of sticks he can get from these 4 pieces:
- Number of sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 = 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600."
"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Mario has 6 dogs.
   - Total number of legs = \( 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed:**
   - Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
   - Total number of pairs of snowshoes = \( \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs/pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for the snowshoes:**
   - Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
   - Total cost = \( 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is \( 144 \) dollars."
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 bus trips each day.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- So, the total cost of her bus trips per week is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Next, we compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Now, we find the difference between the total cost of her bus trips and the cost of the bus pass:
- The difference is \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the problem states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the farm having half as many sheep as the zoo, which has 20 sheep).

The zoo has 20 cows and 20 sheep (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the problem states the zoo has 20 cows, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm, which has 30 cows, and 20 sheep).

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and sheep from both the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals
Zoo: 20 cows + 20 sheep = 40 animals

Combined: 45 animals (farm) + 40 animals (zoo) = 85 animals

The final numerical answer is 85."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Andy needs to lose 30 pounds, and he knows that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his goal date of July 19th. Today is December 31st, so we calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to December 31st is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to December 31st is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to December 31st is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{180 \text{ days}} = 583.33 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 583.33 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday."

"To find out how much money Julie has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money.
4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find the final amount left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes.
\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
\[ \text{Remaining money after clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400 \]

3. Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining $400 to find the final amount left.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

So, the final numerical answer is $288."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

The total amount of money from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount of money from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \(12 \times 1.50 = 18\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of electricity after adding the new device:
- The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(12 + 2 = 14\) kilowatts per hour.
- The daily cost is \(14 \times 1.50 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the weekly cost for both scenarios:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly cost before adding the new device is \(18 \times 7 = 126\) dollars.
- The weekly cost after adding the new device is \(21 \times 7 = 147\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints a house.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.
2. The rate of one person painting a house is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \).
3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is \( 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \).

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we convert days to hours:

- 2 days is equal to \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week. We know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. For the remaining 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week and 6 hours in one of those weeks.

Let's break it down:

- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
- For the next 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- In one of those weeks, he worked out for 6 hours: \(6\) hours.

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total number of hours he worked out over the 8 weeks:

\[24 + 10 + 6 = 40\]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. First, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years:

\[ 2 \times (27 + 8) = 2 \times 35 = 70 \]

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 70:

\[ 70 - 5 = 65 \]

This means that Jame's cousin will be 65 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 65:

\[ 65 - 8 = 57 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is 57 years old. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 57 - 22 = 35 \]

So, the number of years separating the age of the two is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the information given:
\[ C = 1100 \]
\[ P = C - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost equation is:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
2. The boys brought back 60 seashells each.
3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

First, let's determine the number of boys and girls:
- Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided equally into girls and boys, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:
- Each boy brought 60 seashells.
- Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
  \[
  10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys:
- The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
- Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's denote the number of days in April. April has 30 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month. The second half of the month will then have \( 15 \) days (since \( 30 / 2 = 15 \)) and Elvis will save \( 2x \) in the second half.

The total savings for the month should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 2x = 1125
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
3x = 1125
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375
\]

So, Elvis saves \( 375 \) in the first half of the month. For the second half, he saves \( 2x \):

\[
2x = 2 \times 375 = 750
\]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \( 750 \) for each day in the second half of the month.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change = Amount given - Total cost

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Rewriting:**
   Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Therefore, writing it twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Second Rewriting:**
   Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Therefore, writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Third Rewriting:**
   Elise rewrites everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and the half alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).
   - Rewriting everything means writing 65 letters again.

Now, we sum up all the letters written:
- First rewriting: 52 letters
- Second rewriting: 13 letters
- Third rewriting: 65 letters

Adding these together:
\[ 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 \]

   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \) upward.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
   - After moving 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground can be calculated by adding the initial angle to the upward movement:
     \[
     \text{Final angle} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
     \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

\[
\boxed{82}

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find out how many candles he needs to buy. 

The ages of the sons are 12 and 4 years younger, which means the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. 

So, James needs candles for two sons, which means he needs 2 candles for the 12-year-old and 2 candles for the 8-year-old, totaling 4 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{4 \text{ candles}}{5 \text{ candles/pack}} = 0.8 \text{ packs} \]

Since James can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 full pack to have enough candles. 

Therefore, James spends:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1 \text{ pack} \times \$3 \text{ per pack} = \$3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$3 \]"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( x \) be the nephew's current age.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.

In 7 years, the nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[

"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate the amount of money Mitchell made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Peter spends each day and then calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys over the week.

First, let's calculate the total amount Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we can find the daily spending by dividing the total amount by 4:

\[
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{4} = 17.5
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find out how many wooden action figures he buys by dividing the daily spending by the cost of one wooden action figure:

\[
\text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{17.5}{5} = 3.5
\]

Since Peter can't buy half an action figure, we assume he buys 3 wooden action figures (as the problem implies he spends exactly $17.5 each day and the cost of 3 wooden action figures is $15, leaving $2.5, which is not enough to buy another wooden action figure).

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after buying the wooden action figures:

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 70 - (3 \times 5) = 70 - 15 = 55
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. We can find out how many plastic action figures he can buy by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of one plastic action figure:

\[
\text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{55}{2} = 27.5
\]

Again, since Peter can't buy half an action figure, we assume he buys 27 plastic action figures.

Now, we can find the total number of action figures Peter will have by adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures:

\[
\text{Total number of action figures} = 3 + 27 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To find the total cost, we need to add up all the individual costs:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 vaccines cost $20 * 3 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 vases cost $12 * 4 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (repairing vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
- Total roses in a month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses.

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- First flower shop orders 20 roses.
- Second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- Third flower shop orders 30 roses.
- Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
- Total roses ordered in a month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses.

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:
- Roses lacking = Total roses ordered in a month - Total roses grown in a month = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of months in 2 years.
2. Determine the total amount of money removed from the account over these months.
3. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account.

First, we know that there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, in 2 years, there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, Katina removes $100 from her account every month. Over 24 months, the total amount removed is:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Katina initially has $3000 in her account. After 24 months, the remaining amount in her account will be:

   - The cost of one loaf of bread is $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - They need to make 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, they need 1 loaf of bread.
   - Total cost of bread = $3.00.

2. **Calculate the total cost of cheese and condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost per sandwich:**
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.
   - Cost per sandwich = $33.00 / 10 = $3.30.

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

5. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Total cost = Cost per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.30 * 10 = $33.00.
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

The net profit is $37.00."

"To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of the carpet, the cost of the padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet, and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times (\$12 + \$2) = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$14 = \$2808 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the padding:
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2 = \$432 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4 = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34 = \$7344 \]

Now, we sum all these costs to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2808 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11448 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we need to first calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum the total number of birds seen over the week:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[ 50 + 50 = 100 \]
\[ 100 + 0 = 100 \]
\[ 100 + 120 = 220 \]
\[ 220 + 20 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 90 = 330 \]

So, the total number of birds seen over the week is 330.

Next, we calculate the average number of birds seen per day by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7):
\[ \frac{330}{7} \]

Performing the division:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( x \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be:
\[ x \times (1 + 0.04) = 520 \]
\[ x \times 1.04 = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]

The number of green jelly beans is:
\[ 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \( 5 \times 44 = 220 \) pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is:
  \[
  16 + 4 = 20
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:
  \[
  13 + 8 = 21
  \]

Now, we find the difference in total costs between eBay and Amazon:
\[
21 - 20 = 1
\]

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles its height every day. Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: \(4\) feet
- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

We can see that on Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than the height of Mark's window (20 feet).

Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on Day 3.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the total protein intake for a week:
\[ \text{Protein intake per week} = 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is \( 30 \) degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is \( 90 \) degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 15 \times 2 = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 10 \times 1.20 = \$12 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

Total rotations per month = (400 miles / 2 miles per rotation cycle) * 725 rotations
Total rotations per month = 200 * 725
Total rotations per month = 145,000 rotations

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We can do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month.

Months before replacement = 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month
Months before replacement = 72 months

Finally, we need to convert months into years. There are 12 months in a year.

Years before replacement = 72 months / 12 months per year
Years before replacement = 6 years

So, the final numerical answer is 6 years."
"To find out how much each pump costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, each pump gives:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we know the total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. We need to convert this to cents:
\[ 24.00 \text{ dollars} = 2400 \text{ cents} \]

Since each pump gives 60 washes and the bottle gives 120 washes, the number of pumps in the bottle is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{60 \text{ washes per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost of the bottle by the number of pumps:
\[ \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 1200 \text{ cents per pump} \]

So, the cost per pump is:
\[ 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Converting this back to dollars:
\[ 1200 \text{ cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period are already covered by the initial funding.
   - Therefore, the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.

3. **Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Each month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars.

4. **Total Funding for Extended Period:**
   - The total funding for the 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."

The first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks and has been played 356 times. So, the remaining number of times it can be played is:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \]

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times before it breaks and has been played 135 times. So, the remaining number of times it can be played is:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \]

Now, we add the remaining play counts of both DVDs:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[ 1509 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of therapy sessions John attended.
2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in therapy.
3. Compute the total cost based on the hourly rate.

**Step 1: Total number of therapy sessions**

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he attended twice for 2 hours at a time.

\[ \text{Total sessions} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

**Step 2: Total number of hours spent in therapy**

Each session is 2 hours long.

\[ \text{Total hours} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Total cost of therapy**

The cost per hour is $125.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's denote the remaining gum after chewing as \( R \). He gives half of \( R \) to his sister, so he keeps the other half. Therefore, the remaining gum after giving half to his sister is:
   \[
   \frac{R}{2}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining gum step by step:

- **Remaining gum after chewing during school**: 
  \[
  20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
  \]

- **Remaining gum after chewing on the way home**:
  \[
  16 - 1 = 15 \text{ pieces}
  \]

- **Remaining gum after chewing after dinner**:
  \[
  15 - 1 = 14 \text{ pieces}
  \]

- **Remaining gum after giving half to his sister**:
  \[
  \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
  \]

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 years from her age at that time to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 years to her current age:

\[ \text{Age in 4 years} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of flowers per row} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. So, we need to find 4/5 of the total number of flowers:
\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert the speed to Mb per second as follows:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to convert this speed to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Adam will need 4 years to grow enough to ride the roller coaster. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Company's acquisition cost} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we find the total profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total cost of cars} - \text{Company's acquisition cost} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = $2000 \)
- The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, so \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \).
- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so \( S = G - 400 \).

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \( $4800 \)."

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's determine the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[
x = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

According to the parents' condition, if the cost per class exceeds $10, they will not sign him up again. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny can miss any number of classes without the parents deciding not to sign him up again.

Thus, Manny can miss all 10 classes and still meet the parents' condition.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel per day.

First, calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
\[ \text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's daily customers} + \text{Julie's daily customers} = 50 + 100 = 150 \]

Now, calculate the total number of customers processed by both in a week (7 days):

"To find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

And the cost of 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to find the total time taken to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

1 \text{ (Howie)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people}
\]

Next, we know that each person will receive 2 cupcakes. Therefore, we multiply the total number of people by the number of cupcakes each person will receive:
\[
27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

Thus, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"To find the final number of likes on Fishio's selfie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of likes after three weeks.
2. Add the 20000 new likes to the number of likes after three weeks.

First, we know that after 1 week, Fishio received 2000 likes. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. The initial number of likes was 2000, so:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, Fishio had 140000 likes. She then received 20000 more likes recently. Therefore, the total number of likes now is:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the final number of likes on Fishio's selfie is:

\[ \boxed{160000} \]"

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her weekly wage from the total amount she earned:

$220 (total earned this week) - $300 (weekly wage) = -$80

Since the result is negative, it indicates that $80 was withheld from her wage. Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is:

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Rice Cooking Time:**
   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Pork Cooking Time:**
   - It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Beans Cooking Time:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total time = Time to cook rice + Time to cook pork + Time to cook beans.
   - Total time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

We know that:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
2. Sheep have 1 head and geese have 1 head.
3. The total number of animal heads is 20, so \( S + G = 20 \).
4. The total number of animal legs is 70, so \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

Let's verify the solution:
- If \( S = 15 \), then \( G = 20 - 15 = 5 \).
- The total number of legs is \( 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \), which matches the given information.
- The total number of heads is \( S + G = 15 + 5 = 20 \), which also matches the given information.

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \)."

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first establish the total number of good days and then subtract the number of good days that have already occurred.

Christina recorded her mood over 30 days, with the following distribution:
- 12 good days
- 8 bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution of good days over the 30 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Second 8 days: 8 bad days
- Third 8 days: 8 neutral days

We need to account for the next three days:
- The next three days are: 3 good days, 1 neutral day, and 2 good days.

Let's break down the good days in the next three days:
- The first day is good.
- The second day is neutral.
- The third day is good.

So, the number of good days in the next three days is:
\[
1 + 0 + 2 = 3 \text{ good days}
\]

Now, we subtract the good days that have already occurred from the total number of good days:
\[
12 \text{ total good days} - 8 \text{ first 8 days} - 3 \text{ next 3 days} = 12 - 11 = 1 \text{ good day}

Let's denote the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes as \( x \).

The proportion can be written as:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 6x = 36 \times 96 \]
\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]
\[ x = 6 \times 96 \]
\[ x = 576 \]

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The final numerical answer is 576."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)
4. \( K = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we substitute \( M = 73 \) into the second equation:
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Now, we substitute \( M = 73 \) into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Finally, we sum the number of cookies each person has:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculating the total:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 302 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{302} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can set up the following equation to represent the final length of the dress:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half of his lawn in turtle mode and the time it takes to mow the other half in rabbit mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In turtle mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In rabbit mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode, we need to find the time it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

For turtle mode:
- Half of the lawn in turtle mode will take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode.

For rabbit mode:
- Half of the lawn in rabbit mode will take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we add the time taken for each half of the lawn:
- Time in turtle mode: 30 minutes
- Time in rabbit mode: 20 minutes

Total time to mow the entire lawn:
\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and then subtract that from the total time they have available.

1. **Total time available for walking to school:** 30 minutes.
2. **Time taken to get to the corner where the library is:** 6 minutes.
3. **Time taken to get to the fire station from the corner:** 13 minutes.

First, we add the time taken to get to the library and the time taken to get to the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the total time already spent from the total time available:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum these costs.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of months in ten years:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the heartworm check costs 60% of \( T \), which can be written as:

\[
\text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.60 \times T
\]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[
T = 40 + 0.60 \times T
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:

\[
T - 0.60 \times T = 40
\]

\[
0.40 \times T = 40
\]

\[
T = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[
\text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine the price for a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Each crate contains 5 bananas.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple.
   - Given that one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each crate contains 12 apples.
   - The price of one apple is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Each crate contains 7 oranges.
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana.
   - Given that one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Summing the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges:
   \[
   5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0
   \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each colored square and then sum these to get the total number of squares. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each square contributes 1 square foot to the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red Squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue Squares} = \text{Red Squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[

2. Calculate the cost for two weeks:
   - The cost for one week is $84.
   - Therefore, the cost for two weeks is \( 2 \times $84 = $168 \).

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production for 48 hours for both types of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The production rate is 50 quarts per hour.
- Over 48 hours, the total production is:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]

For vanilla ice cream:
- The production rate is 12.5 quarts per hour.
- Over 48 hours, the total production is:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to find the overall total production:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $40.00:

Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = Total cost - Discount amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To solve this, let's first understand the deal: for every 2 scoops of ice cream bought, Erin gets 1 scoop for free. This means for every 3 scoops she gets, she only pays for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50. So, the cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. We need to find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00.

First, we divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops. Each set includes 3 scoops, so:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, Erin should buy enough scoops to get 6 scoops in total. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them eats over the two-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost James paid for picking the blueberries. He paid a flat fee of $20 plus $1.5 per pound for 30 pounds of blueberries.

The cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost James paid is:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound.

The cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost he paid from the cost at the store:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, James saved:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original total cost for 500 computers is:
\[ 500 \times 700 = 350000 \]

Since this is the total cost for 500 computers, the original price per computer is:
\[ \frac{350000}{500} = 700 \]

Next, we need to find the new price of each computer after a 10% increase. A 10% increase on $700 is:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]
So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To find the total calories in the omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each ingredient and then sum them up.

1. **Calories from eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

1. **Total number of friends including Bryce**: Bryce and four friends make a total of 5 people.
2. **Total number of pizzas**: Since each person ordered their own pizza, there are 5 pizzas.
3. **Total number of pizza slices**: Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Next, we calculate how many slices each group ate:

- **Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas**:
  - Number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends: \(2 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \times 8 = 16\).

- **The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas**:
  - Number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends: \(2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 9 = 18\).

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups:
- Total slices eaten: \(16 + 18 = 34\).

Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:
- Slices left: \(60 - 34 = 26\).

So, the number of slices of pizza left is 26."

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we can calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]

Therefore, candidate B received:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. The votes received by candidate A and candidate B are 20 and 30 respectively. So, the votes received by candidate C are:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ 50 \]

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. We need to update the number of apples each person has after this exchange:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[
\text{Difference in apples} = 90 - 87 = 3

- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, we know Steven has 10 books. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can calculate the number of books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. Therefore, the difference in the number of books Clara has compared to Alice is:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]

Substituting the cost of a gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the total costs for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the overall total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the total number of students in the class is 50. We are given the number of students who like to bake, which is 10. We are also given that 5 students like to play basketball. Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as \( M \). According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Therefore, we can write:

\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students like to play video games. Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \). The total number of students in the class is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play music, and play video games. So we can write the equation:

\[ 10 + 5 + M + V = 50 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 10 + 5 + 10 + V = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

To find \( V \), we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

\[ V = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is \( 25 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, 1/3 of the 12 birds were scared away. 

First, calculate the number of birds scared away:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means the number of birds remaining in the backyard is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 28 \]"
"To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, we know that the total number of students in the two classes is 80, and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. So, the number of girls in each class is:
\[ 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Initially, Mara had 2 slices of cake on the plate. She added 3 more slices, so the total number of slices became:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards, each costing $1800.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the first park is \(2 \times 26 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the first park is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults at the second park is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for 2 children at the second park is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the first and the second amusement park:
- The difference is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will be able to save 28 dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Total number of groups required = 12

To find the number of students per group when divided into 12 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the problem as stated is not feasible with the given numbers.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 6 groups (as initially stated in the problem), we can proceed as follows:

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Initial number of groups = 6

To find the number of students per group when divided into 6 groups:
\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Since 9 students per group is a whole number, it is possible to divide 54 students into 6 groups of equal size.

Therefore, no additional groups are needed to form 6 groups.

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the weekly rental numbers and then extend that to the two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the weekly rental for weekdays and weekends:
- Weekdays: 5 days a week, 60 chairs rented each day.
- Weekends: 2 days a week, 100 chairs rented each day.

Calculate the weekly rental for weekdays:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 300 \text{ chairs/week} \]

Calculate the weekly rental for weekends:
\[ 2 \text{ days/week} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 200 \text{ chairs/week} \]

Now, add the weekday and weekend rental to get the total weekly rental:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs/week} + 200 \text{ chairs/week} = 500 \text{ chairs/week} \]

Next, calculate the total rental for one 4-week month:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 500 \text{ chairs/week} = 2000 \text{ chairs/month} \]

Finally, calculate the total rental for two 4-week months:
\[ 2 \text{ months} \times 2000 \text{ chairs/month} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

- 6 plates were broken.

Now, we calculate the number of glasses and plates that are still usable:

- Number of usable glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\)
- Number of usable plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\)

Finally, we add the usable glasses and plates to find the total number of usable items:

- Total usable items: \(86 + 42 = 128\)

The final numerical answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the trades step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 20 (from trading large stickers)
   - Small buttons: 27 (from trading small stickers) + 60 (from trading large stickers) = 87 small buttons.
   - Total buttons: \( 20 + 87 = 107 \).

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{107}\)."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the big race. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 9/2:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She also earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the earnings from teaching:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 - 3 = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5/\text{day} = 1 \times 5 = \$5 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for Monday:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the earnings from teaching:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Now, sum up the earnings for Wednesday:
\[ \$60 \]

Finally, sum up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold and the total number of fruity scents sold, and then find the difference.

The perfume company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents each by the end of the day.

Total vanilla scents sold = 5
Total fruity scents sold = 2

Difference in sales = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
Difference in sales = 5 - 2 = 3

Therefore, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Now, let's determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours in the weekend.
2. Determine the remaining time after reading.
3. Calculate the time spent on video games.
4. Calculate the time spent on soccer.
5. Find the percentage of the weekend spent on soccer.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours in the weekend.**

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday.
\[ 7 + 5 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining time after reading.**

Tatiana reads for 3 hours.
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we need to follow the steps of the problem carefully.

1. **Initial number of pencils:**
   Anthony started with 50 pencils.

2. **Pencils given to Brandon:**
   Anthony gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon.
   \[
   \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25
   \]

3. **Pencils given to Charlie:**
   Anthony then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, we calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent driving to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives back home at the same speed, the time spent driving back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent driving is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how many wheels Henry will have left after assembling the cars and motorcycles, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for both the cars and motorcycles, and then subtract this from the total number of wheels he has.

First, let's calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.

\[
\text{Total wheels for cars} = 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.

\[
\text{Total wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels}
\]

Now, let's find the total number of wheels needed for all the toys:
\[
\text{Total wheels needed} = \text{Total wheels for cars} + \text{Total wheels for motorcycles} = 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels}
\]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels he has:

\[
\text{Wheels left} = 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels}
\]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:

\[
\boxed{276}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of movies in series:**
   - Mike has 600 movies in total.
   - A third of these are in series.
   - Number of movies in series = \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \).

2. **Calculate the number of non-series movies:**
   - Total movies - Movies in series = Non-series movies.
   - Non-series movies = \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).

3. **Calculate the number of older movies:**
   - 40% of the non-series movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies = \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the number of normal movies:**
   - Non-series movies - Older movies = Normal movies.
   - Normal movies = \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).

5. **Calculate the cost of the series movies:**
   - Each series movie costs $6.
   - Total cost for series movies = \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \).

6. **Calculate the cost of the older movies:**
   - Each older movie costs $5.
   - Total cost for older movies = \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \).

7. **Calculate the cost of the normal movies:**
   - Each normal movie costs $10.
   - Total cost for normal movies = \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \).

8. **Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies:**
   - Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies.
   - Total cost = \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \).

$12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven. The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the distance hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. First, we find half of their driving speed:

\[
\text{Half of driving speed} = \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour}
\]

Then, we find the hiking speed:

\[
\text{Hiking speed} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance hiked:

\[
\text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we sum the distances driven and hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is:

\[
\boxed{330}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \).

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T_A = T_E + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times (T_E - T_A) \)

Substituting the given differences:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \)

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma.

Ava's total score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 80 + 15 + 120 = 215 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10 \times (E_E - E_E) + 5 \times (B_E - B_E) + 30 \times (T_E - T_E) = 0 \]

The difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} = 215 - 0 = 215 \]

The difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Four Pizzas:**
   The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars.

2. **Cost of Two Pizzas:**
   Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each.

3. **Total Cost of the Two Known Pizzas:**

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They ride for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll eliminate \( o \) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (o + w) - (o - 2w) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ o + w - o + 2w = 12 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now that we have \( w = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( o \):
\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.
2. Determine the amount of gas consumed per week.
3. Calculate the cost of the gas consumed per week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.**

Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Andy travels in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of gas consumed per week.**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of gas consumed for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gas consumed per week.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch. We'll break it down into two parts: the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on quarters. She had 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total amount spent on quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on twenties. She had 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. She spent 3/5 of the twenties, so the number of twenties she spent is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ twenties} \]
The total amount spent on twenties is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts spent on quarters and twenties to find the total amount spent on lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}

"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. 

Given:
- The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
- The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day.

We can calculate the temperature during the night as follows:
\[ \text{Temperature during the night} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The temperature during the night is 12 degrees, and the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised by:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:
\[ \text{Number of logs needed} = \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees per log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Thus, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of seashells brought back.

First, we need to find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to determine how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. We calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the 10 groups:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

So, 6 groups brought back seashells. Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40, and the jeans are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, subtract the discounted price from $50:

\[ \text{Money left over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of employees after three months:**
   - Initial number of employees: 200
   - Number of new employees hired each month: 20
   - Number of months: 3

   The total number of new employees hired over three months is:
   \[
   20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}
   \]

   Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
   \[
   200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees:**
   - Salary per employee per month: $4000
   - Total number of employees after three months: 260

   The total amount of money paid to all employees in one month is:
   \[
   260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to all employees over three months:**
   - Total salary per month: $1,040,000
   - Number of months: 3

   The total amount of money paid to all employees over three months is:
   \[
   1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[
\boxed{3120000}

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Adding these together:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 540 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Initial Salary:**
   Billy's initial salary was $10 per hour.

2. **First Raise:**
   After 2 months, Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

3. **Second Raise:**
   On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

Next, let's determine Sally's starting salary.

4. **Sally's Starting Salary:**
   Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   \[
   \text{Sally's Starting Salary} = 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for both Billy and Sally over 20 hours.

5. **Billy's Total Earnings:**
   Billy's hourly rate is $11.50.
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings for Billy} = 11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Sally's Total Earnings:**
   Sally's hourly rate is $10.50.
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings for Sally} = 10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, let's find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally.

7. **Difference in Earnings:**

"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread and the total cost of 2 bagels, and then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. Calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 loaf of bread} = \$2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 loaves of bread} = 3 \times \$2 = \$6
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost of 2 bagels:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 bagel} = \$1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 bagels} = 2 \times \$1 = \$2
   \]

3. Find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and the cost of 2 bagels:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \$6 - \$2 = \$4
   \]

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to determine how many points Nikita scored.

Pierson scored 278 points.

Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. So, we first calculate half of Pierson's score:
\[
\frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:
\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

Thus, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[
\boxed{428}

"First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each child plants 1 tree, and each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

The total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers together gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ \text{Total trees planted} = 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To find \( x \), we can solve this equation step by step. First, we multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 (14 + x) \]

Next, we distribute the 0.30 on the right side:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Now, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Finally, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the video game achievement, we need to calculate the total number of hours she has already played and then subtract that from the required 30 hours.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kris played in the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays for half an hour every day.
- There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
- Therefore, the total number of hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
  \[
  14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kris played in the subsequent week:
- Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of hours played in the subsequent week is:
  \[
  7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours}
  \]

Now, we add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the subsequent week to find the total number of hours played so far:
\[
7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total hours played from the required 30 hours to find out how many more hours Kris needs to play:
\[
30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the video game achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the number of miles that will separate the two cars is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how much James paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the ring including the premium.

First, let's find the total cost of the ring without the premium:
- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost without premium = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we calculate the premium:
- The premium is 30% of the total cost without premium.

Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost without premium to find the total amount James paid:
Total cost with premium = Total cost without premium + Premium
Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can make with the chips he has.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic based on its height and the area.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has. He has two bags, and each bag contains 72 chips:
\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we use the area formula for a rectangle (length times height):
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = \text{Length} \times 3 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he sold more than he had. To find out how many candies he actually had left after the initial sales, we subtract the number of candies sold from the initial amount he had:

100 - 150 = -50

Since he can't have a negative number of candies, this indicates that he didn't have enough candies to meet the demand and he was short by 50 candies. However, he then ordered 100 more candies, so the total number of candies he now has is:

100 (initial order) - 50 (shortage) + 100 (new order) = 150 candies

Now, Dale has 150 candies in total and has already sold 150 candies. Therefore, he still needs to sell:

150 (total candies) - 150 (sold) = 0 candies

So, the final numerical answer is 0."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then determine the total number of additional students who joined by the end of May.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **Number of students at the end of each month**:
   - **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
   - **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
   - **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
   - **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
   - **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

3. **Total number of students by the end of May**:
   - Total students = Students at the end of May = 320

4. **Number of students who joined by the end of May**:
   - Students who joined = Total students by the end of May - Initial number of students
   - Students who joined = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week.

Given that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and he made $105 during the week, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since this is the total number of branches he climbed during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches he climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days in a week}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches climbed per day} = 60 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 60 branches per day."
"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked and then subtract the petals of the flowers she lost.

1. **First set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 3
   - Petals per flower: 5
   - Total petals: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

2. **Second set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 4
   - Petals per flower: 6
   - Total petals: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)

3. **Third set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 5
   - Petals per flower: 4
   - Total petals: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)

4. **Fourth set of flowers:**
   - Number of flowers: 6
   - Petals per flower: 7
   - Total petals: \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

Now, we sum up the total number of petals Rose initially picked:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each set, so she loses:
\[ 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \]

Subtract the petals of the flowers she lost from the total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they use 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows and they dropped 3 on the ground, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the time each person can play the game with a quarter. Jack can play for 20 minutes with a quarter. His two friends who are worse than him can play for 10 minutes each (half of 20 minutes), and his friend who is significantly better can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes).

Next, we need to calculate the total time they play together. They play for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes.

Let's denote the number of quarters used by Jack as \( J \), by the first friend as \( F1 \), and by the second friend as \( F2 \). The total time played can be expressed as:
\[ 20J + 10F1 + 30F2 = 240 \]

We need to find the values of \( J \), \( F1 \), and \( F2 \) that satisfy this equation. Since each friend can only use whole quarters, \( F1 \) and \( F2 \) must be integers.

Let's test possible values for \( F2 \) (the second friend):
- If \( F2 = 0 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 240 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 24 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 12 \) and \( F1 = 0 \) (since \( 2 \times 12 + 0 = 24 \)).
- If \( F2 = 1 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 210 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 21 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 10 \) and \( F1 = 1 \) (since \( 2 \times 10 + 1 = 21 \)).
- If \( F2 = 2 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 180 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 18 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 9 \) and \( F1 = 0 \) (since \( 2 \times 9 + 0 = 18 \)).
- If \( F2 = 3 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 150 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 15 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 7 \) and \( F1 = 1 \) (since \( 2 \times 7 + 1 = 15 \)).
- If \( F2 = 4 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 120 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 12 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 6 \) and \( F1 = 0 \) (since \( 2 \times 6 + 0 = 12 \)).
- If \( F2 = 5 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 90 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 9 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 4 \) and \( F1 = 1 \) (since \( 2 \times 4 + 1 = 9 \)).
- If \( F2 = 6 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 60 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 6 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 3 \) and \( F1 = 0 \) (since \( 2 \times 3 + 0 = 6 \)).
- If \( F2 = 7 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 30 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 3 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 1 \) and \( F1 = 1 \) (since \( 2 \times 1 + 1 = 3 \)).
- If \( F2 = 8 \), then \( 20J + 10F1 = 0 \). This simplifies to \( 2J + F1 = 0 \). Possible values for \( J \) and \( F1 \) are \( J = 0 \) and \( F1 = 0 \) (since \( 2 \times 0 + 0 = 0 \)).

Among these, the simplest and most logical solution is when \( F2 = 4 \), \( F1 = 0 \), and \( J = 6 \). This means Jack uses 6 quarters, the second friend uses 0 quarters, and the first friend uses 0 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is \( J + F1 + F2 = 6 + 0 + 4 = 10 \).

Therefore, the total money used is:
\[ 10 \text{ quarters} \times 1 \text{ quarter/quarter} = 10 \text{ quarters} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day.
3. Calculate the total time in hours.
4. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total time Sandy walked in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins.

\[
8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins of cat food}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins.

\[
6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins of dog food}
\]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

\[
88 \text{ tins of cat food} - 36 \text{ tins of dog food} = 52 \text{ tins}

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total number of eggs Cindy has:

\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The loss Milly will incur is the total shipping cost minus the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the loss is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21.00. However, the question asks for the final numerical answer in terms of loss, which is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"

Money left = Total amount before purchases - Total cost of purchases
Money left = $140 - $80 = $60

The final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. **First week production:** 8,000 bars
2. **Second week production:** Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third week production:** Three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the additional items she needs installed. The initial installation cost includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

First, we calculate the number of additional mirrors Angela needs:
\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the number of additional chandeliers Angela needs:
\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \]

The number of additional pictures Angela needs is:
\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \]

The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the cost for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures is:
\[ 2 \times 15 + 1 \times 15 + 10 \times 15 = 30 + 15 + 150 = 195 \]

The initial installation cost is $129.00. Adding the cost of the additional items, the total cost for Angela is:

"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the heights of the mountains each person can lift.

1. **Pompei's mountain height**: Given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's mountain height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay's mountain height is:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's mountain height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami's mountain height is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \) km/h.
   - The total time taken by 3 kangaroos to travel across the highway is 18 hours.
   - The total distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - For 3 kangaroos, the total distance is \( 3v \times 18 \) km.
   - Therefore, the total distance \( D \) is \( 54v \) km.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \) km/h.
   - Let the number of turtles be 4.

3. **Calculate the time taken by the turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total distance \( D \) is \( 54v \) km.
   - The total speed of the 4 turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \) km/h.
   - The time taken by the 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, the time taken is \( \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \) hours.

Therefore, the number of hours it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway is \(\boxed{27}\)."

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- Total number of students = 20

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes. Each group requires 10 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the simple interest (I) for 3 years:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time in years. Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   I = 300 \times 2.25 = 675
   \]
   \[
   I = 675 \times 3 = 2025
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount (A) after 3 years:**
   The total amount is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 300 + 2025 = 2325
   \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{2325}
\]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, they build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, they build \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Adding these together, we get:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the total number of homes built over the next three years is 144."

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide 54 by 8 to find out how many packs are needed:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than 54, Mr. Jackson will have 56 - 54 = 2 extra glue sticks. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 3A = 85 - 37 \]
\[ 3A = 48 \]
\[ A = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:

\[ Fawn = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is:

\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah sold.

Given:
- Total glasses sold: 32
- Julie sold: 14 glasses
- Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as \( M \). Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold \( M \) glasses.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell can be expressed as:
\[ 14 + M + M = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 14 + 2M = 32 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 18 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ M = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is given as $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has for her friend. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. Let's assume she can buy \( x \) meters of the new rope with the $40 she has.

\[
\text{Cost of the new rope} = 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} \times x \text{ meters}
\]

Since she will use the entire $40 to buy the new rope, we set the cost of the new rope equal to $40:

\[
1.5x = 40
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{3} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. Since she spends all $40 on the new rope, she will have:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 - 40 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. We need to find the number of years, \( x \), such that her age in \( x \) years will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8, so three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her present age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and the total cost is $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Thus, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2x + 15 = 65
\]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x = 50
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 25
\]

Therefore, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. 

\[

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for both the orchids and the daisies.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

Total petals for orchids = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid
Total petals for orchids = 5 × 5 = 25 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.

Total petals for daisies = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy
Total petals for daisies = 4 × 10 = 40 petals

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
Difference in petals = Total petals for daisies - Total petals for orchids
Difference in petals = 40 - 25 = 15 petals

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We can find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Therefore, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the sizes of Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms together:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. 

\[
50 - 10 = 40
\]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. 

\[
40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages}
\]

Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply the total number of packages by the pay rate per package.

\[
320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{64}

"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he drinks:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 - 40 = 18 \]

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3:
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance by 1000 miles:

\[ \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} = 3 \, \text{tune-ups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Wednesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Thursday} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[
\text{Total hours} = \text{Hours on Tuesday} + \text{Hours on Wednesday} + \text{Hours on Thursday}
\]
\[
\text{Total hours} = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the expenses and the total amount spent:

1. **Cake Cost**: $11
2. **Balloons Cost**: 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. At $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. **Ice Cream Cost**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each, so the cost is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each one of them received half of the total amount.

So, the amount each one of them received is:
- Each one received $28 / 2 = $14

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets Larry has:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by this daily consumption.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since Martha collects one shell every month, by her 10th birthday, she will have collected:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in total. She has 27 cups of tea and uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

Since she divides these 12 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of each type is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Now, we know that she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total. She divides these cups into 3 rows, with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Since the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea in each row is the same, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ 2 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. We need to find out how many such trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

The number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he needs to pick up per trip is:
\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of water in the tank.
2. Calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given the rate of emptying.

First, we know that the pool has 10000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, the amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water emptied in 6 days is:
\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:
\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total cost for popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total cost for candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from the total money he has:
- Colby has $150 initially.
- After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, he has \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars left.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10 per movie. We need to find out how many $10 tickets he can buy with $126:
- The number of movies he can see is \( \frac{126}{10} = 12.6 \).

Since he can only see a whole number of movies, we take the integer part of the division, which is 12.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to first calculate the calories for the mini versions of the cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins, and then sum them up.

1. **Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Maria also got 2 balloons, so that's an additional 2 balloons. Therefore, before her mom gave them more balloons, the total number of balloons was 8 (for her friends) + 2 (for Maria) = 10 balloons.

Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), that's 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 more balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is 10 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 25 balloons.

The final numerical answer is 25."

   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding the donated boxes to the already owned boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The final numerical answer is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

\[
\text{Widgets per day} = 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}
\]

\[
\text{Widgets in a month} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

\[
\text{Widgets per day} = 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}
\]

\[
\text{Widgets in a month} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets}
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from each machine:
- Each widget sells for $6.

\[
\text{Revenue from Widgeteer 3000} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, let's find the difference in revenue:

\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars}

Thus, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1600 pesos.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours (each hour at 70 pesos) is \(12 \times 70 = 840\) pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for a 24-hour stay is \(1600 + 840 = 2440\) pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 12-hour stay and then adds the cost for the additional 12 hours:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours (each hour at 70 pesos) is \(12 \times 70 = 840\) pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for this option is \(1000 + 840 = 1840\) pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The difference is \(2440 - 1840 = 600\) pesos.

Thus, Cameron would save \(\boxed{600}\) pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times \text{Hay per goat} - 3 = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from the remaining amount:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled out, we start by calculating the total number of letters Craig has spelled out.

Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled out after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters spelled out by Craig and his brother:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[
9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[
29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has after redeeming the coupons to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself.

\[
900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
\]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours. Since the labor cost is charged for part of an hour, we will round up to the nearest whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The cost of parts: $60

Now, we sum these components:

\[
\text{Total charge} = \text{Visit fee} + \text{Labor cost} + \text{Parts cost}
\]

\[
\text{Total charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Therefore, Patty charged \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15.

\[
10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
\]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price.

\[
60\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.60 \times \$150 = \$90
\]

So, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.

James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40. We need to calculate the total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs.

\[
5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200
\]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out. This is the difference between the total amount he paid for the CDs and the total amount he received from selling the 5 CDs.

\[
\$90 - \$200 = -\$110
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that James was out $110. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{-110}
\]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9 (yams) + $20 (sweet potatoes) + $5 (carrots) = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining distance}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has in terms of the number of loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Substitute the number of loaves Sam had into the expression.

Let's denote the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 70 \).

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7S - 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 70 \) into the expression:
\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

Calculate the value:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 450 \]"

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

"To find out how old Leo is, we can set up the following relationships based on the information given:

1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Deanna is 26 years old.

First, let's determine Marcus's age. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. Let's denote Leo's age by \( L \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{L}{2} \]

Since we already know Marcus's age is 21, we can set up the equation:

\[ 21 = \frac{L}{2} \]

To find \( L \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ L = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be represented as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be represented as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the total time he worked and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
- 15 hours = 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes = 900 / 15 = 60 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can now calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Total reports stapled = 60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports.

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1800."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - Total sleep time = 8 hours = 480 minutes.

2. **Calculate the time she was sleepwalking:**
   - She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Duration of sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time = 6 a.m.
   - Early wake-up time = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
   - Duration of early wake-up = 55 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time she was not on her bed:**
   - Total time not on bed = Time sleepwalking + Time early wake-up
   - Total time not on bed = 23 minutes + 55 minutes = 78 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time she slept on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time = 480 minutes
   - Time not on bed = 78 minutes
   - Time on bed = Total sleep time - Time not on bed
   - Time on bed = 480 minutes - 78 minutes = 402 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 402 minutes."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially. We know that he has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 24 cups. According to the problem, Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has initially is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has remaining is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons. Since he has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons remaining, the total number of utensils is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we need to account for the additional patients admitted due to the coronavirus outbreak. The hospital admits 50 patients each day. Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these 700 patients to the initial number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney.

Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people:

\[ \text{Actual number of people} = \frac{\text{Reported number}}{1 + \text{Percentage over}} \]

Here, the reported number is 48 and the percentage over is 20%, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

\[ \text{Actual number of people} = \frac{48}{1 + 0.20} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, we perform the division:

\[ \text{Actual number of people} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can find out how many balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in 2 holes:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the third day was 27, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave to her mom and her sister:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \text{ (to mom)} + 2 \text{ boxes} \text{ (to sister)} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes that is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means she kept 3 boxes, and the rest she sold. The number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \]

We need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left(\frac{1}{2}S + 4\right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2}{2}S + \frac{1}{2}S + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3}{2}S + 4 \]

To find the total number of states, we need to know the value of \( S \). However, the problem does not provide the exact number of states in the USA. Therefore, we can only express the total number of states in terms of \( S \).

Given that the problem does not specify the exact number of states in the USA, we cannot provide a numerical answer. The expression for the total number of states in both countries together is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as \( D \) and the current age of his brother as \( B \).

Given:
- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine the age difference between Emil and his dad. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now (24 - 19 = 5). At that time, his dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. At that time, Emil will be 24 years old, so his brother will be:
\[ 24 = 2B \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ B = 12 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 43 + 12 = 55 \]

- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:

\[
20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90
\]

So, the total number of beads Adrianne has is:

\[

"First, let's determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. This is calculated by subtracting the number of football players from the total number of students:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Now, we know that 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Let's calculate this:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

To find the total number of students leaving early, we add the number of football players to the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Now, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily amount by 7:

\[ \text{Brother's weekly pretzel intake} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is:
  \[
  \text{Total cost per basket} = 9 + 5 = 14 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil gives:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:

- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp:
- Time to peel 90 shrimp: 15 minutes
- Time to sauté 90 shrimp: 30 minutes
- Total time: \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias' Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds.
   - \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, \( 120 \) seconds is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total amount he needed minus the money given by his parents.

So, Adam's contribution from his savings is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

"First, we need to determine the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the distribution of the watermelon slices among the family members. Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices:
\[ V = 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on each activity:

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours.
2. Time spent on inpatients: 20 minutes per inpatient, and there are 9 inpatients.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} \times 9 \text{ inpatients} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting 180 minutes to hours:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment, and there are 10 appointments.
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes/appointment} \times 10 \text{ appointments} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Converting 300 minutes to hours:
   \[
   300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total time spent on all activities:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, along with the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed and variable costs, which is $25 + $15 = $40.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is 3 days/session * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480/month.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ p = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 \]
\[ p - m = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the final numerical answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the babies to the initial population to find the total population after a year.

**Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

**Step 4: Add the babies to the initial population to find the total population after a year.**

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons and the cost per gallon.

First, let's calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9 to find the total number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Total gallons needed} = 10472 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Total gallons needed} = 62040.8 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 62040.8 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 6204.08 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $6204.08."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color of stick and then sum them up.

   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sticks of each color:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34

"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Matteo}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Shandy}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped into the tank from the tank's total capacity to find out how many gallons are remaining:

- Remaining gallons: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains \( 91\% \) of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains \( 93\% \) of its charge from the previous step. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{(0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3} \]

Let's calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

Now, multiply these values:
\[ (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \approx 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.536 \]

Finally, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.536} \approx 0.523 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.523 \) or 52.3%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.
2. Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.
3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate 20% of the cost of the car.**

The cost of the car is $10000. Therefore, 20% of $10000 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2000.

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \times 40 + 15 \times 40 = 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, Janet earns $1000 per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks required to save $2000.**

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits, he will have:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. She bought a box containing 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs of sweets for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is the total number of pieces minus the pieces she kept:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total number of pieces given to friends by the number of friends:

"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% increase annually to the initial price of $120.

First, let's calculate the price after the first year:
\[ \text{Price after 1 year} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Price after 1 year} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05) \]
\[ \text{Price after 1 year} = 120 \times 1.05 \]
\[ \text{Price after 1 year} = 126 \]

Next, we calculate the price after the second year:
\[ \text{Price after 2 years} = \text{Price after 1 year} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Price after 2 years} = 126 \times 1.05 \]
\[ \text{Price after 2 years} = 132.3 \]

Finally, we calculate the price after the third year:
\[ \text{Price after 3 years} = \text{Price after 2 years} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Price after 3 years} = 132.3 \times 1.05 \]
\[ \text{Price after 3 years} = 138.615 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:
\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. 

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. This means each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies and portraits can be calculated as follows:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums * Pictures per album
- Number of portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album

Substituting the given values:

- Number of selfies = 3 * 9 = 27
- Number of portraits = 2 * 9 = 18

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits combined is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 77 \]"
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, let's add these amounts to find her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. Since there were 100 eggs hidden in total, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 = 40 eggs. Therefore, the friends found 40 eggs."
"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Add this to the 12 pounds: \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month.
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day.
   - Total ore mined by one dwarf in a month: \( 18 \times 30 = 540 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 40 dwarves.
   - Each dwarf mines 540 pounds in a month.
   - Total ore mined by 40 dwarves: \( 40 \times 540 = 21600 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 21600 pounds."
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost of the sandwiches is directly proportional to the number of sandwiches in the package.

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches. We know that the cost per sandwich is $1.5, so for 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total cost Tom has to pay for the new bedroom set after selling his old one. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. 

So, the remaining amount he needs to pay for the new bedroom set is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount per month. 

To find 10% of $2000, we calculate:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final numerical answer is:

   - Red balloons: 25
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 12

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - 40% of the red balloons burst.
   - Number of red balloons that burst: \( 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \)
   - Remaining red balloons: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.
   - Number of yellow balloons released: \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \)
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

4. **Blue Balloons Found:**
   - Sally found 8 blue balloons.
   - She added 75% of these blue balloons to her remaining clutch.
   - Number of blue balloons added: \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \)

Thus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of convincing the teacher: 20% or 0.20
  - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

The combined probability of not having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario is:
\[ 0.60 + 0.80 = 0.40 \]

Thus, the probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario is:
\[ 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 \]

Now, combining both scenarios:
\[ \text{Total probability of having to turn in homework} = (0.50 \times 0.50) + (0.50 \times 0.60) \]
\[ = 0.25 + 0.30 \]
\[ = 0.55 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{55\%} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This includes the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats available = 6000
Seats for graduates = 950
Seats for faculty = 300

Total tickets to be distributed = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty
Total tickets to be distributed = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, we need to split these 1250 tickets equally among the graduates. Let's assume there are \( G \) graduates. The number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

\[ \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Total tickets to be distributed}}{G} = \frac{1250}{G} \]

However, the problem does not specify the number of graduates. If we assume the number of graduates is known or can be determined, we can calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate would receive. Since the number of graduates is not provided in the question, we can only express the answer in terms of \( G \).

If we assume the number of graduates is \( G \), then each graduate would receive:

\[ \frac{1250}{G} \]

Since the problem does not specify the number of graduates, the final numerical answer cannot be determined without that information. Therefore, the answer in terms of \( G \) is:

\[ \frac{1250}{G} \]

If we assume a specific number of graduates, we can substitute that value for \( G \) and get the numerical answer. For example, if there are 500 graduates:

\[ \frac{1250}{500} = 2.5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 2.5 tickets. But without the specific number of graduates, the answer remains in the form of \( \frac{1250}{G} \)."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

"To determine how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate her total earnings from jury duty.
3. Calculate her total expenses for parking.
4. Determine her net earnings after expenses.
5. Calculate her earnings per hour after expenses.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.**

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her total earnings from jury duty.**

Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate her total expenses for parking.**

Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine her net earnings after expenses.**

Subtract the total parking expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate her earnings per hour after expenses.**

Divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Thus, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = Total width of the driveway / Distance between each bottle
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to go from one bottle to the next = 5 seconds
   - Number of intervals = 7
   - Total time = Time per interval * Number of intervals
   - Total time = 5 seconds * 7 intervals = 35 seconds

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds."
"To determine the total number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
2. Determine how many packs of eight apples can be made from the total number of apples.

First, we know that each box contains 40 apples. Since Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples can be made from 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11 \text{ per pound} = \$22 \]

The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6 \text{ per pound} = \$18 \]

Next, we add the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from her initial amount:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned during his college years:
- During his college years, Jim would have earned $0 because he was in school.
- Therefore, the total income during his college years = $0.

Finally, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the total amount borrowed:
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $100,000.
- Total amount borrowed = $200,000.
- Net income = $100,000 - $200,000 = -$100,000.

Since Jim would have a negative net income, he would need to earn $100,000 more than he would have earned if he had not gone to college to cover the cost of his loans and the income he lost while in school.

To find out how long it would take to earn $100,000 at his pre-college income of $25,000 per year:
- Time required = $100,000 / $25,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

1. **Calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:**
   - Length: \( 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \)
   - Width: \( 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \)

2. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area = Length × Width
   - Area = \( 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \)

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

3. **Calculate the total area of fabric needed:**
   - Total area = \( 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \)

Thus, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \text{Average amount lost} = \frac{21.5}{3} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average amount lost per race is:
\[ 7.17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.17 \]"

- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

First, calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, calculate the total population by multiplying the total number of cities by the number of people living in each city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total population in South America is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount they divided is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since the painters worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day, the total number of hours worked by all painters is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{\frac{63}{8} \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = \frac{63}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours} \]

Converting \(\frac{63}{32}\) to a decimal gives:
\[ \frac{63}{32} = 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1.96875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, Rory retrieved \(\boxed{10}\) tennis balls in the first set."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = \$20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 - 0.21) = (20000 \times 0.79) \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79^2 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), can be calculated as:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 - 0.21) = (20000 \times 0.79^2) \times 0.79 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.627441 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.627441 = 12548.82 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{12548.82} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we calculate:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the 50 books are written in German, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
50 - 25 - 5 = 20
\]

So, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate how far she has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. 

So, the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already driven} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

The final numerical answer is 1630 kilometers."

"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we need to follow the sequence of events and update the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 140 - 50 = 90
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people after boarding} = 90 + 100 = 190
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after disembarking} = 190 - 80 = 110

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1 ft by 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\$2400

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the additional cost as follows:

\[ \text{Additional cost} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2304 \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin beds}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king bed}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
  \]

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
\[
2 \text{ loads (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ load (king bed)} = 3 \text{ loads}
\]

Since Greg does this every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
\[
52 \text{ weeks in a year}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total number of loads Greg does in a year:
\[
3 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 156 \text{ loads/year}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas in total. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]
So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time taken for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took \( D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 58."
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[
20 - 14 = 6
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[
2 \times 20 = 40
\]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[
40 - 32 = 8

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the trucks that successfully delivered.

First, we know that Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks that failed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \).

Next, we need to consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every two pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for one pound.

Let's break down the cost for 6 pounds of butter under this promotion:

1. Dennis will buy 6 pounds of butter.
2. For every 2 pounds, he pays for 1 pound.
3. Therefore, for 6 pounds, he will pay for 3 pounds (since \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)).

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Dennis will pay for 3 pounds.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come: 45 - 4 = 41

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 20 guests are already covered by the base fee, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 guests (41 - 20 = 21).

The cost for the additional guests is:
- $6 per guest * 21 guests = $126

Now, we add the base rental fee to the additional cost:
- Base rental fee: $125
- Additional cost: $126

Total cost:
- $125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is $251."

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in one day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day from the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30, Jenny needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. Therefore, she will receive $5 in change. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Jenny will leave with 20 quarters. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves (30 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.
   - Departure time: 35 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (35 minutes).
   - Departure time: 35 + 20 = 55 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 55 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 10 minutes, he will wait for his train for:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.

\[
\text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
\]

**Step 3: Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
\]

The discount percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[
\boxed{10\%}

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.

2. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per spring per hour:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.
   - Since one jellyfish is created every second, in one hour, one spring creates \( 3600 \) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per spring per 4 hours:**
   - In 4 hours, one spring creates \( 4 \times 3600 = 14400 \) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \( 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 72000 \]"
"To find Frankie's score, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so \( B = 90 \).

Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. This can be written as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195.

\[
\boxed{195}

"To determine the total time James took to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance from home to halfway point: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \)
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for this segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance from halfway point back to home: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for this segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Distance from home to the store: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time for this segment: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \)

Now, we sum up the times for all three segments:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

The total amount of fence between them is 100 feet, so we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
26

"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 65 \)

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes sold \(\times\) Price of one MTB = \( 65 \times 500 = 32500 \)
- Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes sold \(\times\) Price of one BMX = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes sold \(\times\) Price of one Trekking bike = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = Earnings from MTB bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 32500 + 11250 + 67500 = 111250 \)

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{111250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the net number of bales produced or removed each hour and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - In 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - The net number of bales is the number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up.
   - Net bales = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour workday is 12."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of periods John has each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes, so he has \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day, so he spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week, so he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - The total weekly minutes are 1600, so the extra learning time is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total number of minutes John spends learning each week:**
   - The total minutes spent learning each week is the sum of the minutes spent in class and the extra learning time.
   - This is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total minutes spent learning into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total hours spent learning each week is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is \(\boxed{\frac{85}{3}}\) or approximately 28.33 hours."
"First, let's determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. The third-floor balcony is 3 stories high, and each story is 24 feet:

\[
3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
\]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet}
\]

On the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag.

Total apples sold = 2000
Apples per bag = 10

Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag
Number of bags sold = 2000 / 10
Number of bags sold = 200

Now that we know 200 bags were sold, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag.

Price per bag = $5

Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
Total earnings = 200 * $5
Total earnings = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. According to the problem, this amount is 270 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately \(22.22\%\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train.
   - Half of 60 miles per hour is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles.

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles.

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
270 miles"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then determine how many people he helps.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Next, we calculate the number of days Billy takes off:
- He takes 20% off.
- Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

Now, we calculate the number of days he works:
- Total days - days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:
- 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Finally, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works:
- 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people.

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for one day's lunch and breaks.
2. Multiply the total time for one day by 5 to get the total time for 5 days.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Let's start with step 1:

- Bobby's lunch time per day is 30 minutes.
- His break time per day is 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes.
- Therefore, the total time for one day's lunch and breaks is 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes.

Now, for step 2:

- The total time for 5 days is 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

Finally, for step 3:

- To convert 300 minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
- 300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, which is equal to \( \frac{T}{15} \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \).

Given that 40% of \( N \) is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ N = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls in the school, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

- Total height from the 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Total height from the 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we find the combined total height of all heels:
- Combined total height: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Now, we find the total number of heels:
- Total number of heels: \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:
- Average height of the heels: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
3. Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike each day.
4. Determine the difference between the planned daily hike and the required daily hike.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike each day.**

"To find out how long it will take the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we first need to determine the rate of blinking.

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate of blinking per minute as follows:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of blinks}}{\text{Rate of blinking}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we need to first calculate the total number of male and female fishes after Tate buys more.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fishes, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11 male fishes
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16 female fishes

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective chores and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Megan = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior did laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time taken by Dior = 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 8 hours = 12 hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 4 hours, we assume the minimum of 8 hours for this calculation).

Now, we sum the times for all three chores:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[
10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
\]

Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. According to the problem, Sofie's total distance is twice Brian's total distance:
\[
70 \text{ miles} = 2B
\]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is:
\[12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is:
\[20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

However, we calculated that the first 4 workers produced only 200 toys. This discrepancy indicates that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different set of conditions, but based on the given information, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce the remaining toys in the same 10-hour period. The number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce is:
\[400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

Therefore, the fifth worker needs to produce:
\[200 \text{ toys} \div 10 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ toys per hour}\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of both dogs} = 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he gave the other half to Kris. Therefore, Kris received \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means that the number of stickers Kris received is the sum of the stickers he kept and the stickers he gave to Rob, which is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers. Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
S = 64
\]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. The final numerical answer is:
\[

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms/bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 50 days."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:

\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:

\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam's age two years ago: \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

Let Vince's age two years ago be \(x\). According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so we can write the equation:
\[14 = 2x\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{14}{2} = 7\]

So, Vince's age two years ago was 7 years. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
\[7 + 2 = 9\]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the weight of each box in pounds is:

\[ \text{Weight of each box in pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes. There are 25 boxes, each weighing 0.5 pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of the boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/box} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of the crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Converting the total weight of the crayons to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight of the crayons in pounds} = \frac{200 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 12.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 12.5 \text{ pounds (crayons)} + 12.5 \text{ pounds (boxes)} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Find their mother's salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write the equation for the time spent on the beach as:
\[ 40 = \frac{2}{v} \]
Solving for \( v \), we get:
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach. So her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many more weeks Jane will need to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has already saved.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount, given that she saves $4 each week.

First, Jane has saved $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This can be calculated as:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Jane will need 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. After pouring, the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the second mug is \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce is poured from the 5-ounce mug).

The final temperature of the water in his water bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. Since he has 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( \frac{T}{5} \) degree water, the final temperature \( F \) is given by:

\[ F = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times \frac{T}{5}}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + \frac{T}{5}}{5} = \frac{660 + T}{25} \]

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need:

\[ \frac{660 + T}{25} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 25, we get:

\[ 660 + T \geq 1000 \]

Subtracting 660 from both sides, we get:

\[ T \geq 340 \]

So, the second mug must be at least 340 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{340} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks (since 3 weeks = 21 days).

So, the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- There are 21 days in three weeks.

So, the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Number of cows added: 420
- Total number of cows: \( 50 + 420 = 470 \)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Number of chickens added: 210
- Total number of chickens: \( 20 + 210 = 230 \)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after Russell orders 4 packs of bagels with a 10% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:**
   Each pack costs $10.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

\[
3 - 1 = 2
\]

So, 2 potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Given that 2 potatoes are needed for 1 less than 3 scoops, we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.

\[
\frac{2 \text{ potatoes}}{1 \text{ less than 3 scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2 \times 18}{1} = 36
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 36 potatoes.

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert total eggs to dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by 3.

From the problem, we know:
- Each bouquet of sunflowers costs $8.
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- Faraday earned $56 from selling bouquets per day.

First, we calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets per day}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} \times 12 = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]

  \[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
  \[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
  \[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:

- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\).

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:

- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:

- Total apartments = apartments in the first complex + apartments in the second complex + apartments in the third complex
- Total apartments = 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment in all complexes. Therefore, the total number of garbage collections per week is:

- Total collections per week = total apartments \(\times\) collections per apartment per week
- Total collections per week = 1040 \(\times\) 3 = 3120 collections.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:

- Weekly earnings = total collections per week \(\times\) payment per collection
- Weekly earnings = 3120 \(\times\) 0.40 = $1248.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced by each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

\[
\boxed{1850}

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. Let's confirm this by checking the combined length:
\[ R + B + Y = 20 + 5 + 12 = 37 \]
The combined length is indeed 37 centimeters, so the length of the red rope is correct.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received thrice as much as Ronnie, so we can write:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

This means Rissa received $15. Ronnie received $5. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. So we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister. So the amount left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint:
\[ R = W = P \]

Half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms and the living room, and then add the area of the rest of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[
\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[
\text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[
\text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet}
\]

Now, we add the area of the bedrooms and the living room to find the total area of the bedrooms and the living room:
\[
\text{Total area of bedrooms and living room} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} = 2160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Finally, we add the area of the rest of the house, which is given as 1000 square feet:
\[
\text{Total area of the house} = 2160 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[
\boxed{3160}

"To find out how many puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Monday, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Tuesday, which is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Wednesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She counts double the number of puffs from Thursday, which is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run with the new box of dishwasher pods for $1, given that each pod lasts one cycle.

First, let's find out how many pods are in the new box. The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box has 100 pods.

Calculate 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the new box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cycles can be run with $1 if each pod costs $1. Since each pod lasts one cycle, the cost for one cycle is $1.

Therefore, with $1, you can run:
\[ 1 \text{ cycle} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left after paying the bill is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has after tripling is:

\[
20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Chalk Usage at 20% per Day**: The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches, at which point the teacher will have to recycle it.

Let's denote the remaining chalk length after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). The initial length of chalk is \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches. Each day, the chalk length is reduced by 20%, so the remaining chalk length after \( n \) days is:
\[
L_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n
\]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( L_n < 2 \):
\[
2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2
\]

Divide both sides by 2.75:
\[
(0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{200}{275} = \frac{8}{11}
\]

Now, we need to solve for \( n \) in the inequality:
\[
(0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
\[
\ln((0.8)^n) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
\]

Using the property of logarithms \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\):
\[
n \ln(0.8) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
\]

Since \(\ln(0.8)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.8)\) and reverse the inequality:
\[
n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.8)}
\]

Calculate the values:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.315
\]
\[
\ln(0.8) \approx -0.223
\]

Thus:
\[
n > \frac{-0.315}{-0.223} \approx 1.41
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of girls on varsity.
2. Determine the number of boys on varsity.
3. Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:
\[
\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class to find the number of students not on varsity. The total number of students in the class is:
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24
\]
\[
\text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[

Given:
\[ M = 5 \]

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike:
\[ J = 3M + 2 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ J = 3(5) + 2 \]
\[ J = 15 + 2 \]
\[ J = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth.
2. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.
4. The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
5. To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the numbers:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50%."
"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned due to expiry.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the returned milk. Since the cost of milk is $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the refund amount is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Now, let's check the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed 20 years. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. 

To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ books}}{500 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{x \text{ books}}{27000 \text{ dollars}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \times 27000}{500} \]

\[ x = \frac{2700000}{500} \]

\[ x = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, Bob has $27,000 to distribute among 3 schools. To find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} \]

\[ \text{Books per school} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends and then figure out how many whole pizzas are required to meet this demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many whole cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \div 12 = 3\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \div 8 = 3\).

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 whole pizzas, she needs to buy:
- 3 cheese pizzas
- 3 pepperoni pizzas

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce in an hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, we can work backwards to find Jim's age at that time.

If John was 28 years old at the time Digimon came out, and he was twice as old as Jim, then Jim was half of John's age at that time. 

So, Jim's age at the time Digimon came out was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.

Since 20 years have passed since Digimon came out, we need to add 20 years to Jim's age at that time to find his current age.

Therefore, Jim's current age is \( 14 + 20 = 34 \) years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to, which means they had 3 extra bandages left.

Now, let's summarize the bandages used and left at the end of each day:
- **First Day:** Used 38, left 62.
- **Second Day:** Used 28, left 6.
- **Third Day:** Ordered 100, used 25, left 78.

To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we need to backtrack from the end of the third day:
- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
- Before ordering 100 bandages on the third day, they had \(78 - 100 = -22\) bandages, which means they had 22 bandages before ordering the 100 bandages.

Since they had 22 bandages before ordering the 100 bandages, and they had 6 bandages left after using 28 bandages on the second day, they must have started with \(22 + 6 = 28\) bandages on the first day.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 28."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair length decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means she had a haircut of 10 - 8 = 2 inches. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is 2 * $30 = $60.

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40.

So, the total cost for the haircut and color is $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:
100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily pay is:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Her weekly pay is:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total pay for April is:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not miss any days in April, she receives this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Adding her regular pay and the bonus together gives her total earnings for April:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

Therefore, Jen will receive:
\[ \$310.00 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once and earns $3.00 for each laundry task.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once and earns $1.50 for each cleaning task.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Taking the trash out**: Jason took the trash out twice and earns $0.75 for each trash-out task.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times and earns $0.50 for each dishwasher task.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum the amounts earned from each task:
\[
3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information given, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1200 \]"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered the restaurant.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first was 50, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered the restaurant.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:
\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Adding the number of red and black pens together gives the total number of pens Alain has:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:
\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Now, we need to determine the cost per bottle of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac. John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 per bottle, so:
\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2400}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[140\]"
"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was left after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:

1. On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons.
2. On the first evening, his children drank 4 gallons. So, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. On the second day, Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons. So, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons. So, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party. If the remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among the 3 people, each person would get:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons, which can also be expressed as approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22\).

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:**
   - Total number of fish = 66.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22.
   - Remaining fish = \(66 - 22 = 44\).

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - \(\frac{5}{11}\) of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \(\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20\).

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = 20.
   - Total number of fish with red or blue stripes = \(22 + 20 = 42\).

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is 42."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. So, Amy loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

So, Amy uses up 3 colors from the makeup set:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the house as follows:

\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. We know that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is the height of the second floor itself, which is 240 inches.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can start by calculating the total miles walked by the first three dogs and then use the average to find the total miles walked by all four dogs. Finally, we can subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk.

The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

The average miles walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles per day. Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in one day is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount John gets.
2. Determine how much of the loan amount he uses to pay off his debts.
3. Calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

First, we calculate the loan amount John gets. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that:

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, we determine how much of the loan amount he uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts:

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts:

\[
\text{Leftover amount} = \text{Loan amount} - \text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   - Trinity bought the magazines at $72.
   - She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them.
   - Therefore, the selling price is \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \).

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99
   \]
   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.
   - Cost price = $72
   - Selling price = $99
   - Profit = $99 - $72 = $27

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades (grades 4, 5, and 6).
   - Total students = 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students.

2. **Number of students who can try the escape room at a time:**
   - Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.

3. **Number of groups needed:**
   - Total students = 30
   - Students per group = 8
   - Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 30 / 8 = 3.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need 4 groups.

4. **Time each group takes:**
   - Each group takes 45 minutes.

5. **Total time required:**
   - Number of groups = 4
   - Time per group = 45 minutes
   - Total time = Number of groups * Time per group = 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 27 = (K + 8) - 12 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 27 = K + 8 - 12 \]
\[ 27 = K - 4 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 27 + 4 = K \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November is $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both his standard lessons and his lessons for veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total earnings from these lessons are:
  \[
  4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per hour} = \$320
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons for veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 25% off his standard rate.
- The reduced rate is:
  \[
  \$80 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \text{ per hour}
  \]
- The total earnings from these lessons are:

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of pomelos Eve gave away is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 of them:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. We calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

Subtract the 9 apples given to his sister from the remaining 36 apples:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. We calculate the total money he received:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Grapes Madeline ate**: 
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother**:
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Total grapes used by Madeline and her brother**:
   Adding the grapes used by Madeline and her brother:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes remaining after Madeline and her brother**:
   Let \( x \) be the total number of grapes at the beginning. After Madeline and her brother used 36 grapes, the remaining grapes are:
   \[
   x - 36
   \]

5. **Grapes used for the pies**:
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

6. **Setting up the equation**:
   The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their share must equal the grapes used for the pies:
   \[
   x - 36 = 48
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x - 36 = 48
   \]
   Adding 36 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 48 + 36

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms. We know that they work 8 hours per day and spend 2.5 days cleaning, so the total time spent cleaning is:

\[ 2.5 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total hours spent cleaning}}{\text{Total hours in a day}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{24 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20}{24} \right) \times 100 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, let's determine how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:

Price per egg = $1 / 3 eggs = $0.3333 (repeating)

Total earnings from selling 60 eggs at $0.3333 per egg:

Total earnings = 60 eggs * $0.3333/egg = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Calculate the total points scored by multiplying the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. Therefore, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. So, the total number of points she has scored is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

Thus, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ \boxed{3360} \]"
"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he ended up with 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to ensure he meets or exceeds the 15 car sales goal).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:
200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of people**: There are 4 people in the house, including Brianna.
2. **Number of flashlights**: There are 4 flashlights for the 4 people, and additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room. Since there are 8 rooms, there are \(2 \times 8 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).
3. **Number of rooms**: There are 8 rooms in the house.
4. **Number of small candles**: There are 4 small candles for half the rooms. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms, so there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
5. **Number of medium candles**: There are 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms, so there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) medium candles.
6. **Total number of candles and flashlights**: Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together, we get \(20 + 16 + 20 = 56\).

Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is 56."

"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

First, we calculate the amount of water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants, the remaining number of plants is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ plants} \]

Each of these 8 plants needs a quarter of a cup of water, so the total amount of water needed for these plants is:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we sum up the water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the land segment and the water segment. The total distance is 200 yards, with half of it being on land and the other half in water. Therefore, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. His hopping speed is 20 yards per minute. The time taken to hop 100 yards is:
\[
\text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. His swimming speed is 10 yards per minute. The time taken to swim 100 yards is:
\[
\text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time for the journey is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we have:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

Here's the breakdown of the weekly cost:
- Cost for 5 blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for 1 skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)
- Cost for 2 pairs of pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair of pants} = \$16.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total weekly cost:
\[ \$25.00 + \$6.00 + \$16.00 = \$47.00 \]

Finally, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost over 5 weeks:
\[ \$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00 \]

So, Alicia spends \$235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ \text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so:

\[ \text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by his new speaking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \, \text{minutes} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: Conor saw 20 more people than on the first day, which means he saw \(50 + 20 = 70\) people.
3. **Third Day**: The total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day, which means he saw \(2 \times 70 = 140\) people.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 \]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \(x\). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day for the entire week was 60. Since there are 6 days in the week, the total number of people Conor saw over the week is:
\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

We already know the total number of people Conor saw on the first three days is 260. Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days combined is:
\[ 360 - 260 = 100 \]

Since the average number of people seen each day is 60, and there are 3 days left, the total number of people seen on these 3 days is 100, which matches our calculation.

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate halves, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we will break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**

   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \( 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Tim's best friend Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
   - This means he needs \( 2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups} \) of lemon juice for the extra tart lemonade.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - For the 4 gallons of regular lemonade, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - For the extra tart lemonade, he needs 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the total lemon juice needed is \( 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - Each cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons (since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice).
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of lemon juice, he needs \( 6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons} \).

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is 36."

- Legs from the 4-legged animals: \(15 \times 4 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[20 + 60 = 80\]

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[80 \div 2 = 40\]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the equation for the total number of blocks as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Given that Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16 years
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years
Emma's age = 56 years

Now that we know both their ages, we can calculate the average of their ages:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Five pigs each eat 8 pounds of feed per day.
- Therefore, the total feed consumption for five pigs in one day is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption for five pigs over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption for five pigs in one week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumption from the initial amount of feed:
- The amount of feed left after a week is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party. John invited 20 guests and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs:

\[
20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[
40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of hot dogs are required. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the number of additional hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs}
\]

Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the packs of hot dogs is:

\[
6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she planned to distribute.

First, let's add up the meals given out on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals she planned to distribute:
Total meals planned: 1,360
Meals given out: 142

Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142

Now, let's calculate the remaining meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night.
- Therefore, she spends \(15 + 15 = 30\) minutes per day on meditation.
- Since she meditates 5 days a week, she spends \(30 \times 5 = 150\) minutes per week on meditation.
- Over 4 weeks, she spends \(150 \times 4 = 600\) minutes on meditation.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices 1 hour of yoga each day.
- Since there are 7 days in a week, she practices yoga \(1 \times 7 = 7\) hours per week.
- Over 4 weeks, she practices yoga \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

Now, we sum up the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Time spent on meditation: 600 minutes.
- Time spent on yoga: 28 hours.

To convert the yoga time to minutes, we know that 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 28 hours is \(28 \times 60 = 1680\) minutes.

Adding the time spent on meditation and yoga:
\[ 600 + 1680 = 2280 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time back to hours and minutes:
\[ 2280 \text{ minutes} = 38 \text{ hours and } 0 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{2280} \text{ minutes} \]"
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower. We add the seeds from both:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

"To find out how tall Jackie was before summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Anne's height.
2. Determine Jackie's height before summer.

First, we know that Albert is 36 inches tall. According to the problem, Anne is twice the height of Albert. Therefore, Anne's height is:
\[ \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:
\[ \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. Therefore, her height before summer was:
\[ \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - \text{growth} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{67} \]"

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total original price for 2 T-shirts is \(2 \times 8 = $16\).
- The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, so for every two T-shirts, the first one is at full price and the second one is at 50% off.
- The first T-shirt costs $8.
- The second T-shirt is at 50% off, so it costs \(8 \times 0.5 = $4\).
- Therefore, the total cost for 2 T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = $12\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is \(40 \times 0.40 = $16\).
- The discounted price of the shoes is \(40 - 16 = $24\).

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
- Total cost of T-shirts: $12
- Total cost of shoes: $24
- Total amount spent: \(12 + 24 = $36\)

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."

\[ \text{Cost per ice cream cone} = \$1.25 \]
\[ \text{Number of ice cream cones} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of ice cream cones} = 1.25 \times 4 = \$5 \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ \text{Money left after buying ice cream cones} = 18 - 5 = \$13 \]

Finally, let's determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \text{Cost per movie ticket} = \$6.50 \]
\[ \text{Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy} = \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor \]

Perform the division:

\[ \frac{13}{6.50} = 2 \]

Since the result is a whole number, Ryan can buy exactly 2 movie tickets.

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

Now, let's find the total cost for one jar:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: Half as many as requested, so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Petri dishes: Two more than the number requested, so \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- Beakers: The correct number, so 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Total gathered items:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost some items. Let's determine how many items he lost.

The difference between the total gathered items and the items placed on the lab bench:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs. 

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30.

The final numerical answer is 30."
"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Let's calculate the total:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

\[
\boxed{2180}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Aaron's distance = \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa:**
   - Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed.
   - Let Vanessa's speed be \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Then, Aaron's speed is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

3. **Calculate the time Aaron took to run his distance:**
   - Aaron's time to run 2 miles is given as 16 minutes.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
     \[
     16 \text{ minutes} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{2v \text{ miles per minute}}
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     16 = \frac{2}{2v} = \frac{1}{v}
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate Vanessa's time to run her distance:**
   - Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
     \[
     \text{Vanessa's time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.
- The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.

First, calculate the total amount of line needed for the current dock length:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the nightly revenue and then multiply it by the number of days the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the nightly revenue:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- For each reservation, they order 2 meals and a $5 bottle of wine.
- The cost of 2 meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- The cost of the bottle of wine is $5.
- Therefore, the total cost per reservation is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the nightly revenue is:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much they make in a week. The restaurant is open 2 days a week:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[
\text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we need to calculate 125% of the cost per watermelon (100% + 25% profit):

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

\[
\boxed{2.00}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine James's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so Dora is currently 9 years old.
   - James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

2. **Determine the current age of John:**
   - John had a son James when he was 19, so John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

3. **Determine the current age of Dora:**
   - Dora is currently 9 years old.

4. **Determine the current age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In one hour, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In one hour, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. 

To find the discounted price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \text{Discount}) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 400 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

To find the cost of the installation, we calculate:
\[ \text{Installation Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} \]
\[ \text{Installation Cost} = 50 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Installation Cost} = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the installation cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price} + \text{Installation Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 80 + 150 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
