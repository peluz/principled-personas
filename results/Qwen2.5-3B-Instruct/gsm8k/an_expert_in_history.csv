"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
2. Subtract the number of eggs eaten for breakfast.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used for baking.
4. The remainder will be the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market.
5. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.

Let's go through each step:

1. Total eggs laid per day: 16 eggs.
2. Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3 eggs.
3. Eggs used for baking: 4 eggs.
4. Eggs remaining for sale: \(16 - 3 - 4 = 9\) eggs.
5. Price per egg: $2.
6. Daily earnings: \(9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for a robe, we need to consider the amounts of blue and white fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed, we add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber:
   \[
   2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, we need to determine the new value of the house after Josh's repairs and the subsequent increase in value.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then spends $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, the total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The problem states that the repairs and subsequent work increased the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house and add it to the original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase in value means the value increases by:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, Josh sells the house for its new value of $200,000. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost Josh incurred from the selling price:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one session (3 sprints):**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each time, the total distance for one session is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total distance for one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per meal. She has a flock of 20 chickens.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} \]

In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed:
\[ 25 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per meal, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 40 cups, and this is for 20 chickens.

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon for 20 chickens is:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed required for the entire day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The amount of feed left for the final meal is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3 \]

Now, we can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can pair up the glasses:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair costs $8, so the total cost for 8 pairs is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Restart due to Windows updates:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Resuming the download from the beginning:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (since 80 GB have already been downloaded).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each segment:
- Time for the first 40% of the download: 40 minutes
- Time for the restart: 20 minutes
- Time to resume the download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\) at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, we determine the number of regular hours and overtime hours:
- Regular hours: 40 hours
- Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

Next, we calculate her earnings for the regular hours:
- Regular hourly rate: $10
- Regular hours: 40
- Earnings for regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Then, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
- Overtime hourly rate: 1.2 times the regular hourly rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour
- Overtime hours: 5
- Earnings for overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Finally, we add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in the third month} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Sum the number of downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We set this equal to the initial cost to find \(n\):
\[7.5n = 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{2x}{6} + 1 = \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{4x}{6} - \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   We know that after these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

   \]

4. **Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   \[
   16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

5. **Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is \(\boxed{60\%}\)."
"To determine which purchase plan will maximize the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item based on the given market growth rates.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market growth rate: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + $125
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market growth rate: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market growth rate)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,096

Next, we calculate the profit for each option:
- Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize his profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.
   - The total distance is 12 miles.
   - The formula for average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for total time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Marissa has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles.
   - She has spent another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles.
   - Total time spent so far:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired: 3 hours
   - Time already spent: 2 hours
   - Remaining time:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 12 miles
   - Distance already covered: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance:
     \[
     12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Determine the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance: 6 miles
   - Remaining time: 1 hour
   - Speed required:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

"To determine how much water is in the remaining 24 liters after the spill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.
2. Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.
3. Determine the total amount of water after the spill.
4. Calculate the total volume of the mixture after the spill.
5. Determine the concentration of water in the final mixture.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink.**

The orange drink is two-thirds water:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple drink.**

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of water after the spill.**

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is:
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{17}{3} + 9 = \frac{17}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total volume of the mixture after the spill.**

The total volume of the mixture is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 - 1 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 5: Determine the concentration of water in the final mixture.**

The concentration of water in the final mixture is:
\[ \text{Concentration of water} = \frac{\frac{44}{3}}{24} = \frac{44}{3} \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{44}{72} = \frac{11}{18} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{11}{18}} \text{ of the total volume} \]

However, if we need the numerical value of the water in liters:
\[ \frac{11}{18} \times 24 = \frac{11 \times 24}{18} = \frac{264}{18} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{44}{3}} \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Since Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond is currently:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, his son was born when Raymond was 23 years old. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, the number of years ago his son was born is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years ago} \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to break down the sales by each group of customers:

1. The first 3 customers each buy 1 DVD. So, the number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3
   \]

2. The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs. So, the number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

3. The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs. So, the number of DVDs sold to these customers is:
   \[
   3 \times 0 = 0
   \]

Now, we sum the DVDs sold to all the customers:
\[
3 + 4 + 0 = 7
\]

Therefore, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total melting over the 4-hour period:
   - Total melting = Rate of melting per hour × Number of hours
   - Total melting = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount). Let's denote the original price by \( P \). According to the problem, Kyle paid $19.50, which is 75% of the original price. This can be expressed as:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

Thus, Mishka spent a total of \(\boxed{243}\) dollars on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we sum up all the guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Next, we find the average by dividing the total sum by the number of guesses (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each of the two 20-minute segments and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, we sum the points from both segments:

\[ 4 \text{ (first 20 minutes)} + 5 \text{ (second 20 minutes)} = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John earns from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. To find out how much money he spent in total, we add the cost of the video games to the money he has left.

\[
160 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 165 \text{ dollars}
\]

We know that John earned $195 from selling his lego sets. To find out how much money he has left after buying the video games, we subtract the total cost of the video games from the money he earned.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 165 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John has $5 left after buying the video games, the remaining $30 must be the money he has left after the purchase.

Now, we need to determine how many lego sets John still has. Initially, he had 13 lego sets. Since he sold all of them, he has 0 lego sets left.

\[
\text{Number of lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

First, we know that John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week. Therefore, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine the time he spends running each day. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:
\[ \text{Time on the other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his running speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Thus, John's running speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is six hours, the time spent running is:
\[
\text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
And the time spent walking is:
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[
\text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]"

1. **Determine the age of Suzy's iPhone:**
   Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone:**
   Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Compare this distance to the dragon's reach to find the difference.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Grandma Jones initially had 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of pie was:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories you can consume in a day.
2. Determine how many calories are left for the chips.
3. Calculate how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining calories.
4. Convert the servings into grams.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories you can consume in a day.**

Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many calories are left for the chips.**

Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. We need to find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 3: Convert the servings into grams.**

Since a 300g bag has 5 servings, each serving is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving} \]

Therefore, 0.8 servings of chips is:
\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of making the candles:**
   - Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and wicks for each 10 candles.
   - For 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks.
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Total revenue = $40.00
   - Total cost = $20.00
   - Therefore, the net profit is:

     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

The net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote:
\[ 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes used and remaining can be expressed as:
\[ 80 - 220 + x = 23 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we find the total amount John spent on ties by adding the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.**

3/4 of the building is occupied.
\[
\text{Number of occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**

Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.
\[
\text{Number of unoccupied units} = 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units}
\]

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled to his destination. However, the question does not provide the distance directly. Let's denote the distance from his starting point to the destination as \( D \) miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel from 1 to 4 PM at 10 miles per hour. The time taken \( t_1 \) is given by:
\[ t_1 = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After reaching the destination, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. The time taken \( t_2 \) to return is:
\[ t_2 = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \):
\[ t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30:
\[ t_{\text{total}} = \frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not provide the distance \( D \), the time it takes Tom to get back in terms of \( D \) is:
\[ \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

If we assume the distance \( D \) is known or can be determined, we can substitute it into this formula to get the numerical answer. However, without the specific distance, the final answer in terms of \( D \) is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4D}{15}} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Revenue from truck tires: \(0 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$0\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480 + \$0 = \$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is \$40.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat has had and then sum them up.

1. Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of kittens Patchy has had} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

3. The adopted kittens are 7.

Now, we sum up all the kittens:
\[
\text{Total number of kittens} = \text{Number of adopted kittens} + \text{Number of kittens Patchy has had} + \text{Number of kittens Trixie has had}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40

   \]

2. **Identify the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the driver and the empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the weight of each box:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of each box} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:**

"First, we need to calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters and each cluster has 20 raspberries, we can find the total number of raspberries in the clusters by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries/cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the total from the clusters:

\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:

\[ \boxed{187} \]"

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $50,000.
   - The annual pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $50,000, which is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

Now, we need to calculate the total pension for the 30 years she worked:

- Pension for the first 20 years: $1,000,000.
- Pension for the next 10 years: $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000.

Adding these together gives the total annual pension after 30 years:

\[ 1,000,000 + 25,000 = 1,025,000 \]

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service is $1,025,000."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and calculate the total.

1. **Calculate the monthly payment for the first half of the year:**
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - Therefore, the total payment for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     140 \times 6 = 840
     \]

2. **Calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year:**
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the original monthly charge.
   - 10% of $140 is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14
     \]
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge for the second half is:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the total payment for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \times 6 = 756
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the payments from the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the five cell phones, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest on the five cell phones.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of one cell phone is $150. Therefore, the cost of five cell phones is:
   \[
   5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Therefore, the interest on one cell phone is:

- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more by buying the flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the discount amount. The original cost of grooming is $100, and the discount is 30%.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the final cost of grooming is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much water each of the two girls received. Since each girl got \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

So, each girl received 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we need to account for the 6 liters of water that the boy received. Adding the water received by the girls and the boy, we get:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left after the girls and the boy have taken their portions is:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"

To find Alex's weight, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 125 - 2 \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Next, we need to find their combined weights. We add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Therefore, their combined weights are 623 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 623 \]"

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games they lost, we can find the number of games they won:
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

So, the number of games they won is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for the 10% increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary After Second Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

6. **Salary After Third Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8000} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of guests who will attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. 

To find out how many guests don't show up, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 guests don't show up. Therefore, the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest:
\[ 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \]

"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the potato salad consumption for both the adults and the children separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information provided.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has:

\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children using the information provided.

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy's age: \( A \)
   - Jackson's age: \( J \)
   - Corey's age: \( C \)
   - James's age: \( H \)

2. We are given the following information:
   - James is 10 years old: \( H = 10 \)
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( H = C - 1 \)
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( H = C - 1 \)

3. Since \( H = 10 \), we can substitute this into the equation \( H = C - 1 \):
   \[
   10 = C - 1
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

4. Now that we know Corey's age is 11, we can find Amy's age using the relationship \( A = C - 2 \):
   \[
   A = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

5. We know Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so we can find Jackson's age using the relationship \( A = J + 5 \):
   \[
   9 = J + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Use Lee's original time to find Gerald's original time.
3. Calculate Gerald's new time after a 10% improvement in his speed.

First, we know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run two seconds faster than Gerald, we can find Gerald's original time as follows:
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find Gerald's new time after his speed improves by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of his original time. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats in the neighborhood and then find the total number of pets.

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   - We know that there are two cats for every dog.
   - Given that the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
   - First, calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
     \[
     \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
     \]
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:
     \[
     \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits to find the total number of pets:
     \[
     \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
     \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Given that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout as follows:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, we can calculate the number of hours James slept as follows:

\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of hours Harry slept compared to James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - When the tomatoes are cooked, they lose half their volume.
   - Therefore, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16-ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

The final numerical answer is:
12"

"First, we need to determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary receives 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. Adding these to her current total gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, the number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the number of plants she will give away from her total gives the number of plants she will remain with:

- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the week:

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to calculate the area of each unrolled fruit roll-up.

For Marcell:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total number of fruit roll-ups: \(3 \times 14 = 42\)

For Beatrice:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total number of fruit roll-ups: \(2 \times 24 = 48\)

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups: \(42 + 48 = 90\)

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
- Average number of fruit roll-ups: \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\)

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many seconds it took Julia to row 64 seconds away from the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the rate of her rowing:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rowed in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to determine how much water the boat took on. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{160}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lessons the whiteboard is used in a day.

   - According to the problem, \( 300 = 50N \).
   - Solving for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

3. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Jamal's photograph is of ducks at the zoo.
   - Since the photograph contains 6 birds, and assuming all birds are ducks (as no other type of bird is mentioned), the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board cost $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board cost $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of all the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards.
- Each board is sold at the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards.
- Each board is sold at the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling all the lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is \(7 + 13 = 20\).

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to determine what fraction of the total 120 teaspoons corresponds to the 7 parts of sugar.

The fraction of the total that is sugar is \(\frac{7}{20}\). Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, so he buys a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total amount he paid is \(6 \times 60 = 360\).

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.
2. Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.
3. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles initially imported.**

The customs officer initially counted 2 containers, with each container containing 5 vehicles.
\[
2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of vehicles added on the second day.**

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. We need to find out how many vehicles were added on the second day.
\[
30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.**

Each container contains 5 vehicles. To find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container.
\[
\frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
\]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary is given as $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40 percent from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40 percent from her initial salary. Therefore, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   Adding Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down the problem day by day and then sum the hours.

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: Sadie slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: Sadie also slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours.
5. **Friday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.
7. **Sunday**: Sadie slept 1 hour more than she did on Thursday, so she slept \(7 + 1 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours for each day of the week:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 6 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 7 \text{ (Thursday)} + 8 \text{ (Friday)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} \]

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments: the first segment where she runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, and the second segment where she runs at 5 miles per hour.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first segment:
\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much time is left after the first segment:
\[
\text{Remaining time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the second segment:
\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Finally, we add the distances from both segments to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}

\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
So, Jennie stamped 20 letters.

After stamping, the number of letters needing stamps is:
\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

We know that after Jennie finished stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started stamping is:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the total number of patient hours seen per day:
- The hospital sees 500 people a day.
- Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.

The number of patient hours per day is:
\[
\frac{500 \text{ patients}}{60 \text{ minutes/patient}} = \frac{500}{60} \approx 8.33 \text{ patient hours/day}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
- Doctors charge $150 per hour.
- The hospital sees 8.33 patient hours per day.

The revenue from the doctors is:
\[
8.33 \text{ patient hours/day} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 1249.5 \text{ dollars/day}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost incurred by the hospital:

- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the second test is:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

Thus, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, we have:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \( 70 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know the total number of cars is 20, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The rest are semi-automatic.

First, calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Automatic cars} - \text{Manual cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is \(20\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q \), we can find the number of baby bees \( B \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much money he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he spends playing video games in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, the total amount of money he would earn in one week if he worked those 14 hours is:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine the total cost including tax, we first need to identify which items are considered nonfood items and then calculate the tax on them. The items that are considered nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The cost of these items before tax is:

- Light bulbs: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on each of these items is calculated as follows:

- Tax on light bulbs: \(3 \times 0.10 = 0.30\) dollars
- Tax on roach traps: \(4 \times 0.10 = 0.40\) dollars

The total tax for nonfood items is the sum of the individual taxes:

\[0.30 + 0.40 = 0.70\] dollars

Next, we calculate the total cost of the nonfood items before tax:

\[3 + 4 = 7\] dollars

Adding the tax to the cost of the nonfood items gives us the total cost of the nonfood items:

\[7 + 0.70 = 7.70\] dollars

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the food items, which are milk and eggs. The cost of these items is:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The total cost of the food items is:

\[2 + 3 = 5\] dollars

Adding the cost of the food items to the cost of the nonfood items gives us the total cost:

\[5 + 7.70 = 12.70\] dollars

Therefore, the total cost including tax is:

\[
\boxed{12.70}
\]"
"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate both his total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
\[ 3 \text{ (current clients)} + 5 \text{ (potential clients)} = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths for all clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths:
- Cost of bleach per client: \( 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$4 \)
- Cost of cloths per client: \( 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$5 \)

Total cost per client:
\[ \$4 \text{ (bleach)} + \$5 \text{ (cloths)} = \$9 \]

Total cost for all 8 clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as:
\[ \$92 \]

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Thus, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare in a year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, in a year (which has 12 months), he can harvest pineapples:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ times} \]

So, in one hectare, John can harvest:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/ha} \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples/ha/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/ha/year} \times 10 \text{ ha} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we sum up the total number of pieces from all three lego sets:

\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Therefore, if Johnny picks up all the legos, he picks up a total of 2125 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
2125

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, she sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return. Therefore, the number of bees returning is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees leaving is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there are 0 bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave, so the hive has 0 bees. After the next 6 hours, 15 bees return, so the hive has:
   \[
   0 + 15 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Then, 60 bees leave, so the hive has:
   \[
   15 - 60 = -45 \text{ bees}
   \]
   Since the number of bees cannot be negative, this indicates that the hive is empty and no bees can leave. Therefore, the hive has 0 bees after the 60 bees leave.

5. **Bee population in the last 6 hours:**
   In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before (30 bees) returns to the hive. Since the hive was empty after the 60 bees left, the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   30
   \]

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the admission tickets and then add the change she received.

First, let's find the total cost of the admission tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of a child ticket is $10.

Adding these together:
\[
12 + 10 = 22
\]

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is $22.

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change received:
\[
22 + 8 = 30
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To determine how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to find out how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Number of Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]

To find the number of Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Number of Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{Number of James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine who will finish the race first and by how much time, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from the school to their respective homes.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance:
\[ 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \]

Tim's distance:
\[ 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel the distance.

Steve's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim's time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes, and Tim finishes in 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total cost of inflating the tires for the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25.

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2.50 + \$2.25 + \$0.25 = \$5.00. \]

Thus, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for 60 cookies is:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/cookie} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the $10 bill:

\[
10 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants ate 1 final fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38
   \]

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 38 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the hours he spends on each type of day and then sum them up for the entire semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, we need to convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We will use inches for this problem.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 2 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

\]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far Blake and Kelly each run, we need to calculate the total distance each of them covers.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
- Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back).
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
  \[
  15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back).
- She does this 34 times.
- Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
  \[
  34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}
  \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distances they run is:
\[
3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final numerical answer is:

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate step by step.

1. **Monday's Water Depth:**
   The tank has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Water Depth:**
   On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's depth} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Water Depth:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's depth} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}

Thus, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the information given:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses. Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish caught: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses caught: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish caught: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught:

\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Calculation**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means that after every two months, the new price is 120% of the previous price.

3. **Number of Price Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many such increases occur in 36 months. 
   \[
   \text{Number of price increases} = \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per increase}} = 18 \text{ increases}
   \]

4. **Price Calculation After Each Increase**: Each price increase is by 120% of the previous price. This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by 1.20. We need to find the price after 18 such increases.

5. **General Formula for Price After \( n \) Increases**: If the initial price is \( P_0 \), after \( n \) increases, the price \( P_n \) is given by:
   \[
   P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n
   \]

6. **Applying the Formula**: Here, \( P_0 = 20 \) and \( n = 18 \):
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

7. **Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \)**:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488
   \]

8. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\boxed{209.76}\)."
"To find the total value of all the toys, we need to determine the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of a red car:**
   - We know that one red car costs $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of one red car is $4.

2. **Cost of an action figure:**
   - We are given that an action figure costs $5.

3. **Cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, three action figures would cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys:

- The value of the red cars: \(5 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ dollars per car} = 20 \text{ dollars}\).
- The value of the action figures: \(3 \text{ figures} \times 5 \text{ dollars per figure} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).
- The value of the doll: \(15 \text{ dollars}\).

Adding these values together gives the total value of all the toys:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the missed income from doing freelance work and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income from doing freelance work. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to compare this missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90. Since the missed income from doing her taxes herself is $105, and the cost of hiring the accountant is $90, the difference is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The question asks how much more money she will have if she hires the accountant, which is the negative of the difference we calculated:
\[ -\$15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-15}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira bought:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation \( S = 2B \):

\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato to seconds for consistency:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50.
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost per gallon:**
   - The cost for lemons per gallon is $3.
   - The cost for sugar per gallon is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     \$3 + \$2 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   - The profit per gallon is the revenue minus the cost:
     \[
     \$10 - \$5 = \$5/\text{gallon}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a $25 profit:**
   - If the profit per gallon is $5, then to achieve a $25 profit, they need to sell:
     \[
     \frac{\$25}{\$5/\text{gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of crabs Monic has.
2. Determine the number of crabs Rani has.
3. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Monic has} = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Next, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
\]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has:
\[
\text{Total number of crabs} = \text{Number of crabs Bo has} + \text{Number of crabs Monic has} + \text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 40 + 36 + 46
\]

Adding these together:
\[
40 + 36 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes, and the total number of votes cast was 80.

First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[
\boxed{20}

   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the faster team:
- Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
- There are 4 members in the team.
- Total time for the faster team = \(4 \times 55 = 220\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the total time for the slower team:
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
- Total time for the slower team = \(60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222\) seconds.

Now, we find the difference in the total times:
- Difference = Time taken by the slower team - Time taken by the faster team = \(222 - 220 = 2\) seconds.

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:
\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]
\[
\text{Percentage difference} = \left(\frac{0.25}{0.25}\right) \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:
\[ 3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats per cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces per rat} = 18r \text{ pieces} \]

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces given to the rats and the hamsters:
\[ 18r + 50 = 160 \]

Now, solve for \( r \):
\[ 18r + 50 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 160 - 50 \]
\[ 18r = 110 \]
\[ r = \frac{110}{18} \]
\[ r = \frac{55}{9} \]
\[ r \approx 6.11 \]

Since the number of rats in each cage must be a whole number, and the problem implies a whole number solution, we need to recheck the context and constraints. Given the problem's setup and the integer nature of the solution, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a need for re-evaluation of the problem constraints. However, based on the given data and the integer nature of the problem, the closest whole number solution would be:

\[ r = 6 \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of Months**: 3

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the initial amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is:
\[ 20n \]

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is:
\[ 2n \]

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 30n - 22n = 8n \]

According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400:
\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the three friends. They spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the amount spent on food is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the food to the cost of the tickets to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also spent $33 on each of the 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the rides to the total amount spent on tickets and food to find the overall total cost:

\[ 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"

"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck.
2. Multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks in the flock.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. There are 7 days in a week, so the daily requirement for one duck is:
\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Next, since there are ten ducks in the flock, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock is:
\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds per day per duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees will be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

**Step 3: Account for the 30% of the trees that die after 10 years.**

30% of the trees die, so 70% of the trees remain. Therefore, the number of trees left after 10 years is:
\[ 130 \times 0.70 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

The final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **After the prank on Saturday morning:**
   - The number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The number of white flamingos added is 6.

4. **On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added:**
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

5. **The number of white flamingos remains 6.**

6. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos minus the number of white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To determine how much change Violetta will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has.

First, we calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the number of cards she collected each month and then sum them up.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total number of cards collected:**
   We sum the cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total collected:
   \[
   20 + 320 = 340
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{340}\)."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the water he gets in the morning and the afternoon separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the water Baldur gets in the morning:
   - He gets 5 pails of water every morning.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the total water in the morning is \(5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 25 \text{ liters}\).

2. Calculate the water Baldur gets in the afternoon:
   - He gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - Therefore, the total water in the afternoon is \(6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 30 \text{ liters}\).

3. Sum the water from the morning and the afternoon to find the total water Baldur gets every day:
   - Total water per day = \(25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters} = 55 \text{ liters}\).

Thus, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is \(\boxed{55}\) liters."
"To calculate how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's original weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary:
- New weekly salary = Original weekly salary + Raise
- New weekly salary = \( 2000 + 100 = 2100 \) dollars per week.

Now, we calculate the total amount of money John made in a year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total annual salary = New weekly salary \(\times\) Number of weeks in a year
- Total annual salary = \( 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total annual salary:
- Total annual earnings = Total annual salary + Monetary reward
- Total annual earnings = \( 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114,200."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of grapes produced by Josie's farm per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year and she has 10 acres, the total production of grapes is:

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be produced from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total production of wine is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year by Josie's farm is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate each part step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores should be 558:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total number of kilometers is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total number of kilometers is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, and then sum these weights.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Given that there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost of buying half a dozen plates:**
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{20} = 1740 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost of each cup:**
   - One dozen cups consists of 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of each cup is:
     \[
     \frac{1740}{12} = 145 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to have at least $70 after her initial $10 savings.

Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn. The total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn is her initial savings plus the money she earns from babysitting plus the money she earns from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 20 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70:
\[10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation \( 3r + 5w = 42 \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total number of eggs:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the total number of eggs collected is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking around the park."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, we calculate the number of customers on the second day. According to the problem, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the number of customers on the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
So, on the second day, Sloane counted 150 customers.

Now, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. We can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

From \( B = 4S \) and \( B = 2S - 16 \), we have:
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the pair of shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the original $2000 plus an additional 10% of that amount.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we need to find out how much of the total amount she promised to return she has paid after 12 months. This is $1980. To find the remaining balance, we subtract the amount paid from the total amount promised:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to determine their current ages and then calculate their ages in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2.
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by the number of people.
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Let Jojo's score be \( J \). The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]
6. Solve for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. According to the problem, Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias he plants is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers planted. This is the sum of the geraniums and the petunias:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to calculate the amount spent in the second year and then add it to the amount spent in the first year.

1. The company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year.
2. In the second year, the company spent a third of $15000 on advertising. So, the amount spent in the second year is:
   \[
   \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
   \]
3. The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is the sum of the amounts spent in the first and second years:
   \[
   15000 + 5000 = 20000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we need to calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour.
- Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours.

The cost for Carlos is:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.
- Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.

The cost for Benji is:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the costs for Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:
\[ 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the days.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.
   - It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - Andrew plans to travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car.
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus.
   - Since it takes 6 days by bus, it will take \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days by car.

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - Andrew will travel by bus for 6 days.
   - Andrew will travel by car for 3 days.
   - Therefore, the total travel time is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) days.

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type cards left = 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type cards now = 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards James has is:
- Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito before any upgrades or discounts:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for upgrading his meal:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To determine how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces per minute and then convert that into hours.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can add per minute together.

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is:
\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Together, they can add:
\[
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Thus, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we need to determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months. The farm initially produced 120 watermelons, and 30% of them were ready for harvest.

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready for harvest} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

After Ashlyn took these 36 watermelons home, the number of watermelons remaining is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We need to find out how many of these were ready:

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two weeks} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is the remaining watermelons after the first harvest minus the number of watermelons that were ready after the second harvest:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax Mark has to pay. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the subtotal before registration fees.

\[
\text{Subtotal} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark then pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Registration fees} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the subtotal to find the total amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is \(25 \times 2 = 50\).

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total number of penguins**: 36

2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**:
   - One-third of the penguins jump in the ocean.
   - Calculate one-third of 36:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
     \]
   - So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

3. **Penguins that go into the cave**:
   - Another one-third of the penguins go into the cave.
   - Calculate one-third of 36:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
     \]
   - So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

4. **Total number of penguins that leave the snow**:
   - Add the number of penguins that jump in the ocean and the number that go into the cave:
     \[
     12 + 12 = 24
     \]

5. **Penguins still sunbathing**:
   - Subtract the total number of penguins that leave the snow from the initial total:
     \[
     36 - 24 = 12
     \]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine how much Steve's girlfriend eats. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \text{Steve's girlfriend's consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total consumption per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve and his girlfriend together eat:

\[ \text{Total consumption per week} = (6 + 3) \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the problem, one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the weekly production of one vine:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly consumption of tomatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many whole pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices:
\[
20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[
\frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Mixing**: He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make one new pen. Since he has 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens from the empty pens.
3. **Remaining Pens**: After making 5 new pens, he will have \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) pens left (the 5 empty pens he used to make the new pens are now full).
4. **Second Mixing**: Now he has 20 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make one new pen. He can do this \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) times, making 4 more new pens.
5. **Remaining Pens After Second Mixing**: After making 4 more new pens, he will have \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) pens left (the 5 empty pens he used to make the new pens are now full).
6. **Third Mixing**: Now he has 15 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make one new pen. He can do this \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) times, making 3 more new pens.
7. **Remaining Pens After Third Mixing**: After making 3 more new pens, he will have \( 15 - 5 = 10 \) pens left (the 5 empty pens he used to make the new pens are now full).
8. **Fourth Mixing**: Now he has 10 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make one new pen. He can do this \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) times, making 2 more new pens.
9. **Remaining Pens After Fourth Mixing**: After making 2 more new pens, he will have \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) pens left (the 5 empty pens he used to make the new pens are now full).
10. **Fifth Mixing**: Now he has 5 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make one new pen. He can do this \( \frac{5}{5} = 1 \) time, making 1 more new pen.
11. **Remaining Pens After Fifth Mixing**: After making 1 more new pen, he will have \( 5 - 5 = 0 \) pens left (the 5 empty pens he used to make the new pens are now full).

Now, we sum up all the pens he has:
- Initial 25 pens
- 5 new pens from the first mixing
- 4 new pens from the second mixing
- 3 new pens from the third mixing
- 2 new pens from the fourth mixing
- 1 new pen from the fifth mixing

Total number of pens = \( 25 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 40 \).

   Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

4. **Sum of the Ages:**
   Now, we sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
   \[
   \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Adding these together:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48

5. The remaining students went out through exit C.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of students who went out through exit A is 30% of the total number of students.
   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after exit A is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. The number of students who went out through exit B is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students.
   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students remaining after exit B is:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

5. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit C} = 280
   \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has:
     \[
     \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

2. **Determine the number of candies James has:**

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's calculate the number of books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's 1 book.

So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's calculate the number of books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's 2 books.

So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora:

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals. After stopping being pen pals with 2 of them, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals left} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the time he spends writing 30 pages is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used and then subtract that from his plan's total allowance.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. Since he has a 15-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes used for these calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people, which is 300 minutes. So, the total number of minutes used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes he has left is:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, after all these transactions, Griffin had 27 fries. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

Given:
- There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
- There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
\[
32 - 4 = 28
\]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums:
\[
28 = 2 \times (2f)
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist spends on her makeup over the 5 weeks.

The makeup artist requires 6 hours of makeup each day and needs it done 4 times a week. Therefore, the number of hours required per week is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, the total number of hours required over the 5 weeks is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jean receives a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Jean pays:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"To determine how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies.

The costs are as follows:

"First, we need to determine the total weight of the onions the chef bought. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, the cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories consumed by both Sue and her sister over the two days and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate \( \frac{13}{5} = 2.6 \) cookies.

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Sue ate each day:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \( 2 \times 2.6 = 5.2 \) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total number of cookies each person ate over the two days:
- Sue's total cookies: \( 20 + 5.2 = 25.2 \) cookies.
- Her sister's total cookies: \( 5 + 2.6 = 7.6 \) cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Sue's total calories: \( 25.2 \times 200 = 5040 \) calories.
- Her sister's total calories: \( 7.6 \times 200 = 1520 \) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
\[ 5040 - 1520 = 3520 \]

So, Sue consumed 3520 more calories than her sister. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3520} \]"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Determine the number of boys and girls in the school.
3. Find out how many girls are in the third class.
4. Calculate the number of boys in the third class.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.**

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes.
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of boys and girls in the school.**

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

**Step 3: Find out how many girls are in the third class.**

We know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
\[ \text{Girls in the first class} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Girls in the second class} = 12 \]

The total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ \text{Girls in the third class} = 30 - 27 = 3 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of boys in the third class.**

Since each class has 20 students and there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Previous Night's Kill:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night = 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals.

2. **Today's Kill:**
   - Let the number of cougars killed today be \( c \).
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so he killed \( 3c \) wolves.
   - It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars today.
   - Therefore, \( c = 12 \).
   - The number of wolves killed today is \( 3c = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Total Animals Killed:**
   - Total animals killed last night = 25.
   - Total animals killed today = 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals.
   - Total animals killed = 25 (last night) + 48 (today) = 73 animals.

The final numerical answer is 73."
"To determine the floor Bill is on after his elevator ride, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use the number of times Anne went down the water slide to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

First, we know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of times Anne went down the slide} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ \text{Number of times Robert went down the slide} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas divides these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. Each stall will get:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

1. **Pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies: \( 100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \) dollar.

2. **Nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels: \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \) dollars.

3. **Dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes: \( 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \) dollars.

4. **Dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills: \( 40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the values of all the coins and dollar bills:
\[ 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Brady has a total of **$45.00** in his piggy bank."
"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books:
\[
0.50 \times 8 = 4.00
\]
So, the cost for the overdue books is $4.00.

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue, which is $2.00:
\[
4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
\[ A_a = 52 \]

From this, we can find the number of apples Jamal has:

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is:

\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can find the total number of fruits Andrea has:

\[ A_{total} = A_a + A_b = 52 + 24 = 76 \]

And the total number of fruits Jamal has:

\[ J_{total} = J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ Total_{fruits} = A_{total} + J_{total} = 76 + 92 = 168 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she plans to make and then convert that into the amount of flour required.

Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. Therefore, the total number of cookies she will make is:
\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]
\[ x = \frac{132}{12} \]
\[ x = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the 9,300 pennies.

First, calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[
\text{Number of pennies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Next, convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:
\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house that Mrs. Cruz needs to pay, which includes the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

1. **Selling Price**: $350,000
2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]
3. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of $350,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

Next, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price Mrs. Cruz needs to pay:

\[
\text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]
\[
\text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C on them. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

The remaining 9 cards had the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the time to dig 30 small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Time to dig 30 small holes = \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) minutes

Next, we calculate the time to dig 15 large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Time to dig 15 large holes = \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) minutes

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:
- Total time in minutes = \( 90 + 150 = 240 \) minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = \( \frac{240}{60} = 4 \) hours

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information given: the sum of their current ages is 20.

Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know from the problem that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ M + R + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which translates to \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This translates to \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. To verify, if Sam is 6 years old, then Ruby is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) years old. In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. Indeed, 45 is 3 times 15, confirming our solution.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each:

\[ 20 \text{ popsicles} \times \$0.25 \text{ per popsicle} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each:

\[ 4 \text{ ice cream bars} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ice cream bar} = 4 \times 0.50 = \$2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find the final numerical answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
2. Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots.
5. Find half of the combined total number of spots.

Step 1: Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
A cobra has 70 spots, and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:
\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:
\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:
\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Step 4: Find the combined total number of spots.
The combined total number of spots is the sum of the spots of all the cobras and all the mambas:
\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Step 5: Find half of the combined total number of spots.
Half of the combined total number of spots is:
\[ \text{Half of combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final amount Maddy will spend is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Determine the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \).

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 68 \]"
"To determine the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(2 \times 20 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(2 \times 40 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(2 \times 60 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each person over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we sum the totals for all three:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Thus, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"First, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
\]

Next, we need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[
\text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21
\]

Thus, Ann's brother will be \(\boxed{21}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop that costs 55 cents. We subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars:
   \[
   3 \text{ rows of 8 stars} + 2 \text{ rows of 6 stars} + \text{rows of 5 stars} = 76 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars}
   \]

3. Subtract the number of stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows with 5 stars:
   \[
   76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. Determine the number of rows of 5 stars:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ stars}}{5 \text{ stars/row}} = 8 \text{ rows}

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The time taken can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many medals have been given out for counting, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of medals Izzy has:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

The final numerical answer is 390."
"First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. Therefore, each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there is a half-hour break, we need to subtract this break from the total working time.

Total working time = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

Next, we need to convert the working time into minutes because Susan earns money based on her earnings per 10 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, the total amount she earns is:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}

"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.
3. Add the extra points to the initial points.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player qualifies for the extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Add the extra points to the initial points.**

- Mike's total points after the extra point: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
- Jim's total points after the extra point: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
- Tony's total points after the extra point: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total points for all three players.**

The total points after the extra points are distributed is \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum up the activities for each day:

**First Day Total:**
\[ 100 \text{ (pushups)} + 50 \text{ (squats)} + 20 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 170 \]

**Second Day Total:**
\[ 120 \text{ (pushups)} + 40 \text{ (squats)} + 40 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 200 \]

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.
3. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the household and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, the total number of meals per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ meals/day} \]

The total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 10 \text{ meals/day} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

The total amount of rice in the bag is 42 kg. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's identify the days Sam was open and the number of crates he sold on those days:
- Monday: Closed
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Friday: Closed
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold on the days he was open:
\[ 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} + 20 \text{ (Saturday)} + 20 \text{ (Sunday)} = 85 \text{ crates} \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was 35 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **First Bid:**
   - Carmen's first bid is $200.

2. **Second Bid:**
   - The next person bids $200 + $50 = $250.
   - Carmen's second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.

3. **Third Bid:**
   - The next person bids $300 + $50 = $350.
   - Carmen's third bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

4. **Fourth Bid:**
   - The next person bids $400 + $50 = $450.
   - Carmen's fourth bid is $450 + $50 = $500.

Thus, Carmen's total expenditure is the sum of her bids:
\[ 200 + 300 + 400 + 500 \]

Let's calculate this sum:
\[ 200 + 300 = 500 \]

"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year, the cost of the miles driven, and the total bonus given to the driver.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day, so he drives 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the miles driven:
- The cost is $2 per mile, so the cost for 15000 miles is \(15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, let's calculate the total bonus given to the driver:
- John gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\).

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving:
- Total cost = Cost of miles driven + Total bonus = \(30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the arrangement of the pages.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages (2 pages on the front and 2 pages on the back).

2. **Pages in a 32-page tabloid**: A 32-page tabloid has 32 pages in total. Since each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages, we need to determine how many pieces of paper are required to print 32 pages.

3. **Calculation**: 
   \[
   \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 8.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90
   - Total books sold in the second year: 45
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \).

3. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250
   - Total books sold in the first two years: 135
   - Total books sold in the third year: \( 250 - 135 = 115 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Total books sold in the first year: 90

5. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the second year:**
   - Total books sold in the second year: 45

6. **Calculate the total number of books sold in the third year:**
   - Total books sold in the third year: 115

7. **Determine the number of unsold books at the end of the third year:**
   - Total books in the collection: 250
   - Total books sold in the first three years: \( 90 + 45 + 115 = 250 \)
   - Unsold books at the end of the third year: \( 250 - 250 = 0 \)

8. **Verify the unsold books:**
   - Given that there are currently 50 unsold books, this indicates that the collection has been reduced by 50 books over the three years.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold in the first three years should be \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).

9. **Re-evaluate the total books sold in the first two years:**
   - Total books sold in the first two years: \( 90 + 45 = 135 \)
   - Total books sold in the third year: \( 200 - 135 = 65 \)

10. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
    - Each book sells for $20.
    - Books sold in the second year: 45
    - Total money earned in the second year: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \)

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{900}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week if the company performed well, we need to add this bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \, \text{weeks} \]

Since Watson earns his weekly bonus each week, we will consider 4 full weeks and the partial week.

\[ \text{Earnings for 4 full weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

For the partial week, we calculate the earnings for the remaining days:
\[ \text{Remaining days in April} = 30 \, \text{days} - (4 \times 7 \, \text{days}) = 30 \, \text{days} - 28 \, \text{days} = 2 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Earnings for 2 days} = 2 \, \text{days} \times 100 \, \text{\$/day} = 200 \, \text{\$} \]

Adding the earnings from the partial week to the earnings from the full weeks:

\[ \text{Total earnings in April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 200 \, \text{\$} = 3400 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, Watson made \(\boxed{3400}\) dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"To determine how many people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches, we first need to calculate how many people he beat and then subtract that number from the total number of people he competed against.

John competed against 20 people. He beat 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he competed against:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
2. Determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
3. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we have:
\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we determine the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales:
\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the amount of weight Joey loses in one week is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as follows:

\[
4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ pounds per week} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the savings for the ice cream and the milk separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream is:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the problem does not specify the original price of one packet of milk, we assume the discount applies to each packet individually. Therefore, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we sum the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

Thus, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra arm grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, 5 extra arms grow in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times an extra leg grows is calculated by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, 3 extra legs grow in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (new limbs)}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[ \text{Cost of business suits} + \text{Cost of suitcases} + \text{Cost of flight ticket} = \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the expenses already calculated from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the three people who eat 3 eggs each:**
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 9 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the two people who eat 2 eggs each:**
   \[
   2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person/day} = 4 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the entire family:**
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   \[
   13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is 32 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people with illness had previous commitments, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store initially had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after adding the 20 marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:

\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \). According to the problem, \( B = 30 \).

The number of girls in the classroom is 3 times the number of boys, so the number of girls \( G \) is:
\[ G = 3 \times B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The number of nongendered children \( N \) is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the number of boys, so:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times B = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

The total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is \( 123 \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

We are given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. Let's denote the number of electric poles by \( P \) and the number of electric wires by \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio equation:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \times 1 \]
\[ 3P = 45 \]
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who left the party and then find out how many women are left.

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total initial people: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

2. **People who left:**
   - After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left.
   - Number of people who left: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

3. **Men who left:**
   - Given that 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
   - Men who left: \(25 - 22 = 3\)

4. **Verification of the number of people who left:**
   - Since 3 men left, the number of women who left must be:
   - Women who left: \(10 - 3 = 7\)

5. **Number of women left:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Women who left: 7
   - Women left: \(15 - 7 = 8\)

Thus, the number of women left at the party is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the cost of the pen is $1. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has in total.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Jam has 26 pencils. Her sister Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Thus, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of both the cooling and the addition of cream separately, and then combine them.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. Therefore, the cream does not affect the milliliters weaker, but it does increase the total volume of the drink.

Since the question asks for how many milliliters weaker the iced coffee is, and adding cream does not change the strength in terms of milliliters, the final answer is simply the milliliters weaker due to the cooling effect:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every 1 new record given out, 2 old records are traded in.

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded in by multiplying the number of new records by the number of old records required for each new record.

\[
\text{Total old records traded in} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records}

"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of junior and senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the monthly salary of each senior programmer:**
   - The monthly salary of each junior programmer is $2000.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Monthly salary of each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
   \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary} = \text{Total salary for junior programmers} + \text{Total salary for senior programmers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required.

The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is a 40% increase.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total time required to charge 40 percentage points.

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[
\boxed{2}

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she is left with:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how much the customer paid for their shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.
2. Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.
3. Calculate the discount from the coupon.
4. Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.

**Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.**

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
\[
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip.**

The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip. Since they spent $43, they used $4 worth of rewards (as they earned $4 in rewards from their last trip).

**Step 3: Calculate the discount from the coupon.**

The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the discount from the coupon is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon.**

The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip. They used $4 worth of rewards, which means the price after applying the rewards is:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

The coupon then takes an additional $8 off the price:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax rate: 10%
- State tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8400}

"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 installments of $350 each

The total cost for the installments is:
\[ 6 \times 350 = 2,100 \]

Adding the advance payment to the total cost of the installments:
\[ 1,350 + 2,100 = 3,450 \]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is $3,450.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 installments of $250 each

The total cost for the installments is:
\[ 9 \times 250 = 2,250 \]

Adding the advance payment to the total cost of the installments:
\[ 1,100 + 2,250 = 3,350 \]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is $3,350.

Now, we find the cost difference between the two offers:
\[ 3,450 - 3,350 = 100 \]

The cost difference between the two offers is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of paintball guns that Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ have combined.

- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard has 5 guns.
- DJ (Jason) has 8 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.

Adding these together:
\[ 10 + 5 + 8 + 1 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns.

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the four individuals (Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ).

To find out how many guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, if they share the guns equally, each person would have:
\[ \boxed{6} \] guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers is \( 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces} \).

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
- Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge is \( 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \).

Now, we sum the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = \( 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \).

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is \(\boxed{310}\) ounces."
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow the changes in the stock price step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after increase} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

3. **Second Year Decrease:**
   The stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 25\% \times \$12 = 0.25 \times \$12 = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{New price after decrease} = \$12 - \$3 = \$9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John ate half the amount that Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We do this by subtracting the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group is then \( x - 10 \). According to the problem, the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. Therefore, he would have a total of \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls.

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. This means he loses 3 balls, so he is left with \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls.

When 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, it does not affect the number of balls Josh is juggling. The ball that gets lost completely is also not considered in the count of balls he is juggling.

Therefore, Josh starts juggling on stage with 4 balls.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of the animals and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

First, let's define the weights of the animals based on the given information:
- Let the weight of the pink frog be \( P \).
- Let the weight of the blue beetle be \( B \).
- Let the weight of the green toad be \( G \).
- Let the weight of the yellow snake be \( Y \).
- Let the weight of the red bird be \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( P = B = G \)
2. \( P = 50 \) pounds
3. \( P = Y - 10 \)
4. \( P = R + 20 \)

Using the first piece of information, we can substitute \( P \) with 50 pounds:
- \( B = 50 \) pounds
- \( G = 50 \) pounds
- \( 50 = Y - 10 \)
- \( 50 = R + 20 \)

Now, we can solve for \( Y \) and \( R \):
- \( Y = 50 + 10 = 60 \) pounds
- \( R = 50 - 20 = 30 \) pounds

Next, we need to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. The container also weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird, plus the weight of the container.

The total weight is:
\[ P + B + G + Y + R + \text{container weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 \]

Now, we perform the addition:
\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine the total distance Tyson covered in June after following his coach's advice, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the new daily distance Tyson runs.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days in June).
4. Provide the final answer.

First, let's find out how much additional distance Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:
\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the new daily distance Tyson should run is:
\[ \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days):
\[ \text{Total distance in June} = 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ \boxed{180000} \]"

"To determine the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to calculate the number of legs contributed by each type of table and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the number of legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs/table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Thus, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ bag/week} \times 36 \text{ cookies/bag} = 36 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we determine how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box each week:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Then, we calculate how many cookies her husband eats in a week:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the cookies her son and husband consume from the total number of cookies:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 20 \text{ cookies/week} - 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Thus, the number of cookies Jenny eats each week is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors when they were making them:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos now that they are making them:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors.

The increase in daily revenue is:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

The percentage increase is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Increase in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage more they are making per day now is:
\[ 10\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is:
  \[
  25 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 100 \text{ dollars/month}
  \]
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:
\[
100 \text{ dollars/month (food)} + 20 \text{ dollars/month (treats)} + 100 \text{ dollars/month (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars/month}

"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the height of the shortest tree.
2. Calculate the height of the second tree.
3. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
4. Determine the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Let's start with the height of the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the shortest tree} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the second tree, which is 5 feet more than the shortest tree:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

90 - 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the remaining $60 can be used to buy snacks or other items for her and her friends, we need to determine how many friends she can invite. Each friend will get $5 worth of arcade tokens, which is the same as the cost of one round of mini-golf.

To find out how many friends can be invited, we divide the remaining budget by the cost of one round of mini-golf:
\[
\frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

Therefore, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{12}\) friends."
"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has in her pocket every day after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the change she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she saves:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the candy Billy bought:**
   Billy started with $10 and spent some of it on candy. Let's denote the amount of money he spent on candy as \( x \). After buying the candy, he had some change left. The change he had was \( 10 - x \).

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had:**
   Billy then took half of his change and spent it on gumballs. He bought 40 gumballs, each costing $0.05. So, the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars. This means that half of his change is $2, so his total change is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy is \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.5 per pound. If Billy spent $6 on candy, the amount of candy he bought is \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distances for one complete trip are:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third segments. The combined distance of the second and third segments is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city back to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the train goes between services every \(\frac{1}{20}\) days, which is equivalent to 12 hours. However, the question asks for the number of days, so the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed requires. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing required for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.

The stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and the stuffing required for a chihuahua bed is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds and the 3 collie beds. The total stuffing for the chihuahua beds is:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
The total stuffing for the collie beds is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]
Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the time John spent driving to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time taken to drive to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 and 3 to fractions with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total time is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of fourth-grade students at Small Tree School. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total.

Next, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys are at the school. We know that 43 of the 96 students are girls, so the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent. To find out how many boys were present, we subtract the absent boys from the total number of boys:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys in the park.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

Jane's scores on the first two tests are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

First, we sum these scores:
\[
15 + 18 = 33
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more points Jane needs to reach a total of at least 42 points. We set up the inequality:
\[
33 + x \geq 42
\]
where \( x \) represents the points Jane needs to score on her third test.

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[
x \geq 42 - 33
\]
\[
x \geq 9
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given by the expression \( 4x - 5 \). Substituting \( x = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, which is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21. \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first find out how many points Erin had after scoring 14 points.

We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. So, we calculate the points Erin has after scoring 14 points:

\[ \text{Points Sara has} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Points Erin has after scoring 14 points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points after having 24 points, we can find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points by subtracting 14 from 24:

\[ \text{Points Erin had before scoring 14 points} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

The total cost is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
2. Determine the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
3. Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment.

First, we calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can find the number of faulty pieces by calculating 40% of the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment by \( N \). The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces of equipment is then \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

Next, we need to find the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment. Since the total cost of all pieces of equipment is $400,000, the cost of each piece of equipment is \( \frac{400000}{N} \). Therefore, the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To determine how much milk Mary collects every day, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep**: Half of 30 sheep is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
3. **Other half of the sheep**: The other half of the sheep is also 15 sheep. These 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.
4. **Milk from the first half**: 15 sheep provide 1 kg of milk each day.
5. **Milk from the second half**: 15 sheep provide 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we add the milk from both halves to find the total milk collected every day:
\[
1 \, \text{kg} + 2 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and then subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

First, we know that Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks in 10 pairs is:
\[ 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks} \]

Next, we know that Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is:
\[ 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

The total number of socks that need washing is 50. Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then find the total amount she will repay. Finally, we will divide this total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   The interest rate is 10% per year. Since the loan period is five months, we need to find the interest for five months. There are 12 months in a year, so the interest rate for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate for five months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{50}{12} \approx 4.1667\%
   \]
   The total interest for five months is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times \frac{4.1667}{100} = 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 150 = 3800
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months. Therefore, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760
   \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Cho}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Chloe}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Thus, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Axel's friend Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we find the total number of pesos they have together by adding the total silver pesos and the total gold pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs her to make the lemonade. She spent $18 to buy the supplies. The profit is the total revenue minus the cost of the supplies:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

So, the profit Millie will make per hour is:

\[ \boxed{4.50} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we need to understand that he sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land and was left with \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, \(\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8\).

To find \( x \), we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:
\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, we multiply:
\[
x = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

Thus, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26. On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the performance is:

\[
26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can make it and the 3 teachers:

\[
13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, we calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, 6 erasers cost \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, 8 pencils cost \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- The total cost is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.
2. Add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to get the total.

First, we know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. The number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson. Therefore, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's determine the cost for David to ride all 9 rides. Since a ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's determine the cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is $2 * 2 = $4. For 9 rides, the total cost is $4 * 9 = $36. Dasha buys 9 tickets, and since each ticket costs $2, the total cost is $2 * 9 = $18.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets. David's total cost is $30, and Dasha's total cost is $18. The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost:

\[ 18 - 30 = -12 \]

Since the negative value indicates that David actually spends more money than Dasha, David does not save any money. Instead, he spends $12 more than Dasha. Therefore, the amount David saves is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap.

Next, we need to divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio. Let the number of popsicles Betty has be \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has be \(6x\). According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Thus, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% savings:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.
- With a 20% savings, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is reduced by 20% of $20.
- The savings amount is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the savings is \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) dollars a month.

Next, we add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
- The total cost of Hulu, Disney Plus, and Netflix is \( 16 + 10 = 26 \) dollars a month.

Now, we compare this total cost to the cost of the cable package:
- The cable package costs $60 a month.
- The total cost of the streaming services is $26 a month.
- The savings amount is \( 60 - 26 = 34 \) dollars a month.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up all the time spent on each task:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to place in the shelving system, we first need to calculate the total number of slots available in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of slots is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x \) is 20 more than double the number of slots, which can be expressed as:

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

Now, we calculate the value of \( x \):

Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Adding the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards Erica passed out and received:

Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find the total number of cards Erica now has, we subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received:
\[ 50 - 24 + 17 \]

First, subtract the 24 cards she passed out:
\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]

Then, add the 17 cards she received:
\[ 26 + 17 = 43 \]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:
\[ \boxed{43} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets, so the cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the cost of the seashells and magnets to find the total amount spent:
$4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. Each pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs of fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 5% of the dangerous candles also explode.

First, let's find out how many candles are dangerous:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \text{ dangerous candles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these dangerous candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the dangerous candles have this defect:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125 \text{ dangerous candles that smell like wet dog} \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{125} \]"
"First, we need to determine the discounted price of each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount per blouse is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees, and doesn't gather any from the average trees. So, her sister gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees and \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 = 500. \]

Substituting the known values of \( A_{\text{tall}} \) and \( A_{\text{short}} \):
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 = 500. \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500. \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350. \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \( \boxed{350} \)."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]

\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[
124 + d = 180
\]

Subtract 124 from both sides:

\[
d = 180 - 124
\]

\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days: 800 km.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: 0 km.

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5
\]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:

\[
T = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is \( 40 \) cubic inches.

\[
\boxed{40}

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Sum the amounts received from both banks.
3. Add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we sum the amounts received from both banks:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the initial capital to the total amount received from the banks:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting the number of cats that ran away from the remaining cats:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods and sum them up.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. **Next 8 months (months 7 to 14):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 8 months = \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) dollars.

3. **Next 16 months (months 15 to 30):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 16 months = \( 16 \times 14 = 224 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
48 + 96 + 224 = 368
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{368}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

Substituting the value of \( T \):
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \] dollars.

The total cost of both jeans is:
\[ T + J = 28 + 22 = 50 \] dollars.

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the total savings as \( S \). So, \( S = 6 \).

The savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3}S = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \] dollars.

The savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ S - \frac{1}{3}S = 6 - 2 = 4 \] dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. We already know that the jogger jeans cost $22 and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \] dollars.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling the cards:**
   Kenny gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   The cost of the ticket to the amusement park is $100. Since Kenny gets to go with $50, he must have made:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   Kenny sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \frac{50}{1.5} = \frac{50 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 cards.

4. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them. If he sold 33 cards, then the total number of cards he started with is:
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \frac{33}{\frac{2}{3}} = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 49.5
   \]
   Since the number of cards must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 49 cards.

Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hot dogs the caterer prepared and then see how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

First, let's calculate the number of hot dogs prepared:
- The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, but he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
- Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
- Each of these 18 guests was supposed to have 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hot dogs prepared is \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hot dogs.

Next, we need to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog:
- 40 guests showed up, but only 36 hot dogs were prepared.
- Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 40 - 36 = 4 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, the number of letters in her sister's name is:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters. Adding these together gives:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is $5.00 * 5 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The items are 20% off, so we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Thus, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container contains:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money George spent on chips and then use that information to find out how many candy bars he bought.

First, let's denote the amount of money George initially had as \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. This means that the money he spent is 99% of his initial amount. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99x = 5 \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = \frac{5}{0.99} = \frac{500}{99} \approx 5.0505 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that George spent $5 on chips and candy bars. Let's denote the number of candy bars he bought as \( y \). The cost of the chips is $0.40 per bag and the cost of each candy bar is $0.75. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]
The cost of the candy bars is:
\[ 0.75y \text{ dollars} \]
The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the chips and the candy bars:
\[ 1.20 + 0.75y = 5 \]
Solving for \( y \), we get:
\[ 0.75y = 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 \]
\[ y = \frac{3.80}{0.75} = \frac{380}{75} = \frac{76}{15} \approx 5.0667 \]
Since \( y \) must be a whole number, we recognize that \( y = 5 \) is the correct integer solution.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the cake Rory cuts into pieces. The cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, each piece weighs:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so the weight of the cake they have together is:

\[
2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we subtract the weight of the cake that Rory and her mom have from the total weight of the cake:

\[
20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs:

\[

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is $2.00:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Therefore, we calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to the oven. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the temperature decrease due to the window. Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we can find the final temperature by starting with the initial temperature and adding the temperature increase from the oven and then subtracting the temperature decrease from the window:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is:

\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times are:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time James takes is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \]

Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 121 + R = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the length of Movie C in minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B in minutes is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A in minutes is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since the horse runs at 32 MPH, in 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), the horse will run:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:
\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total money he has:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays she can put out is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after his turn:

Joey's initial score: 214 points
Points scored by Joey: 26 points

Joey's new score = 214 + 26 = 240 points

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after her turn:

Marcy's initial score: 225 points
Points scored by Marcy: 10 points

Marcy's new score = 225 + 10 = 235 points

Now, we need to find out by how many points Joey is now winning:

Joey's new score: 240 points
Marcy's new score: 235 points

The difference in their scores is:

240 - 235 = 5 points

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, the remaining number of sneakers sold to the department store is:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The revenue from the 31 sneakers sold to the department store at $25 each is:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To determine the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces per packet} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces per packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately:
\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 13 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use this new cost to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

1. **Calculate the initial cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon initially was:
     \[
     \text{Initial cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon:**
   - Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - With the new cost per balloon being $65, the total cost for 170 balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - Calculate \(170 \times 65\):
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. The distance is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]
- For the second segment, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. The distance is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, we find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time taken for the trip:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

Thus, the car's average speed during the trip is \(\boxed{50}\) mph."
"First, let's determine the value of the sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, Jenna has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$2400 \]

After trading, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (since she started with 8 and traded 3). The value of these 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the total value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires she has left to the value of the rubies she received:

\[ \$4000 + \$2400 = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples that Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
3. Add the two quantities together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Marin eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, Nancy eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Thus, the total number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine the volume of one raised bed. The dimensions of each raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is calculated as follows:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 160 bags is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[
\boxed{1920}

"To determine the total number of cards in the set, we need to calculate the number of green and yellow cards based on the given information and then sum all the cards.

1. **Number of Red Cards:**
   \[
   \text{Red cards} = 15
   \]

2. **Number of Green Cards:**
   The problem states that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of the number of red cards and add it to the number of red cards.
   \[
   \text{60% of red cards} = 0.60 \times 15 = 9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]

3. **Number of Yellow Cards:**
   The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   \[
   \text{Yellow cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

4. **Total Number of Cards:**
   To find the total number of cards, we sum the number of red, green, and yellow cards.
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} + \text{Yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

\]

So, 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there. The total number of fairies after these 25 fairies joined is:

\[
50 + 25 = 75
\]

Next, we need to account for the 30 fairies that flew away ten minutes later. The number of fairies remaining after 30 flew away is:

\[
75 - 30 = 45
\]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies that have spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies that have spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed to find the total weight:
\[
2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the total number of basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract these from the total number of cards to find the number of cards she gives to her students:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria gives these 300 cards to her students, and each student receives 10 cards. To find the number of students, we divide the number of cards by the number of cards each student receives:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

"To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with all the sprinkles.
2. Determine how many pans are needed to bake that number of cupcakes.

First, we know that Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with all the sprinkles is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans are required to bake 48 cupcakes, given that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. We do this by dividing the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we calculate three times the price of the pen and then subtract $1:

\[
3 \times 2 = 6
\]
\[
6 - 1 = 5
\]

The piece of paper costs $5.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper:

\[
2 + 5 = 7
\]

The total cost of the pen and the piece of paper is $7. Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the amount of change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
2. Determine the number of pencils used after two months.
3. Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
4. Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.**

There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
\[
\text{Total pencils at the start} = 30 \times 10 = 300
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of pencils used after two months.**

After two months, \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the total pencils were used.
\[
\text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.**

Subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils.
\[
\text{Pencils remaining after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240
\]

**Step 4: Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year.**

At the end of the year, \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining pencils were left.
\[
\text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80
\]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \). We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate the term involving \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. To verify, if Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, he can have \( \frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \) cookies, which matches the problem's condition.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

The length of each remora is 6 inches. Converting this to feet:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage of the shark's body length (10 feet) the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) represents. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To determine how many books each child received, we first need to find out the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent a total of $300, we can calculate the number of books by dividing the total amount spent by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books each of her 4 children received. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the number of children:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Thus, each child received 5 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to determine the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This is given by the union of sets \( D \) and \( P \), denoted as \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in total in the class.

The number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

\[
\text{Total number of employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

\[
\text{Total number of tour guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of employees} + \text{Total number of tour guides} = 600 + 21 = 621
\]

Thus, the total number of people going on this tour is:

\[
\boxed{621}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and Tom and his wife each need a ticket, so the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but it is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend. To find the weekend price, we calculate 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
So, the hotel costs $1800 per day. Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we start by finding the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains.

First, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[
\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:
\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are arranged in the pyramid. The cheerleaders' heights are as follows: 9 out of 10 are 64 inches tall, and the 10th is 60 inches tall.

The human pyramid is structured as follows:
- 4 girls on the bottom level
- 3 girls on the second level
- 2 girls on the third level
- 1 girl on the top level

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the girls in the pyramid. We can calculate this as follows:

1. The 4 girls on the bottom level are each 64 inches tall, so their total height is \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.
2. The 3 girls on the second level are each 64 inches tall, so their total height is \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches.
3. The 2 girls on the third level are each 64 inches tall, so their total height is \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches.
4. The 1 girl on the top level is 60 inches tall, so her height is \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches.

Adding these heights together gives the total height of the pyramid:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet.

Thus, the height of the human pyramid is \(\boxed{53}\) feet."

Let \( A \) be Angela's current age. In four years, Angela's age will be:
\[ A + 4 \]

We know that in four years Angela's age will be 42, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ morning rides}\).
- The total cost for the morning rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides}\).
- The total cost for the afternoon rides is \(28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{224}\)."

- Cost of food per guest: $5 (already included in the price)
- Total cost at the second venue: \( 25n \)

We need to find the value of \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn used by both of them and then convert that into yards.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

- Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364\) yards.
- Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364\) yards.

Let's calculate these values:

- Mariah's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91\) yards.
- Her grandma's yarn usage: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182\) yards.

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \]

So, the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is 273 yards.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie buys for her 5 friends. 

For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. 

Adding these to the gifts for her friends:
\[ 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. According to the problem, the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 18 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum. Therefore, the cost of the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum, which cost $2. She bought one pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum is given as $7. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can get from each type of wood.

For the 2 x 4 pieces:
\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \text{ pieces} \times 200 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

For the 2 x 8 pieces:
\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \text{ pieces} \times 400 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber, he should buy the 2 x 4 pieces. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is:

\[
\boxed{1200}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This means the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals at the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by noting the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.

Given:
- Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
- To lose 1 pound, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
- Therefore, to lose 30 pounds, Andy needs to burn \( 30 \times 3500 \) calories.

Let's calculate the total calories Andy needs to burn:
\[
30 \times 3500 = 105000 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his birthday. Andy's birthday is July 19th, and today is December 31st.

First, calculate the number of days from December 31st to December 31st of the following year:
- December 31st to December 31st of the following year is 365 days.

Now, calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th of the current year:
- December 31st to December 31st of the following year: 365 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding these days together:
\[
31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 \text{ days}
\]

So, Andy has a total of \( 365 + 180 = 545 \) days to reach his goal.

To find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:
\[
\frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{545 \text{ days}} \approx 193.15 \text{ calories/day}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 193 calories.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{193}

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to calculate the weekly consumption and cost for both scenarios.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily consumption and cost before adding the new device.**

- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50

Daily cost:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost:
\[ \$18.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = \$126.00/\text{week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily consumption and cost after adding the new device.**

- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00/\text{day} \]

Weekly cost after adding the new device:

3. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is \(5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}}\).
4. This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days.
5. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equal to \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
48"
"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \). Solving for \( C_O \), we find \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has \( S_O + C_O = 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has \( S_J + C_J = 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 42 + 130 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{172}

"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate the amount of money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

With $4, Tom could have bought:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, the number of additional CDs Tom would have been able to buy is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the different hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we know that for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \(21 \div 3 = 7\) people.

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(70 - 21 + 7 = 56\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Jame's current age and then use that information to find out his cousin's current age. Finally, we will find the difference between their current ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

3. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

4. **Find the difference in their current ages:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - His cousin's current age is 47.
   - The difference in their ages is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years separating the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ C = 1100 \]
\[ P = C - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( B \) be the number of boys.
- \( G \) be the number of girls.
- \( S_B \) be the number of seashells each boy brought.
- \( S_G \) be the number of seashells each girl brought.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are 20 kids in total, so \( B + G = 20 \).
2. The boys brought back 60 seashells each, so \( S_B = 60 \).
3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, so \( S_G = S_B + 4 \times S_B = 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \).

Since the groups are equal, \( B = G \). Therefore, \( B + B = 20 \), which simplifies to \( 2B = 20 \). Solving for \( B \), we get \( B = 10 \). Consequently, \( G = 10 \).

Now, we need to find the number of seashells each girl brought. Since each girl brought 300 seashells, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:

\[
S_G = 300
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm}

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his target, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Monthly Savings Target**: Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125.

2. **Number of Days in April**: April has 30 days.

3. **Savings in the First Half of April**: The first half of April consists of the first 15 days. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

4. **Savings in the Second Half of April**: The second half of April consists of the last 15 days. Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

5. **Total Savings Equation**: The total savings for the month can be expressed as the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
   \[
   15x + 15(2x) = 1125

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia.
2. Calculate the daily cups of coffee Juan drinks.
3. Determine the reduction needed for Juan to meet the daily recommendation.

Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee:
   \[
   \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2}
   \]

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks:
   \[
   \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R
   \]

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his intake from \( 5R \) to \( R \).

To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we calculate the difference between his current intake and the recommended intake:
\[
\text{Reduction needed} = 5R - R = 4R
\]

Since \( R \) is the daily recommended cups of coffee, the reduction needed is:
\[
\text{Reduction needed} = 4R - 4
\]

However, since the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is calculated by summing their weights and dividing by the number of people (which is 3).

\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(10 \times 5 = 50\) degrees upward from the pyramid.

3. **Final Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees.
   - After moving 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground will be \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

\[
\boxed{82}

"First, we need to determine the ages of James' sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the total number of candles James needs. Since he has two sons, he needs 2 candles. 

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 2 candles ÷ 5 candles/pack = 0.4 packs. Since James cannot buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 full pack to have enough candles.

Therefore, James spends $3 on candles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, the number of pages she can read in 105 minutes is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor each ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches:

\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches:
\[
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Thus, the number of sandwiches left is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew. Let's denote the nephew's current age as \( x \).

First, we know that Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, in 7 years, the nephew's age will be:
\[ x + 7 \]

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the nephew is currently 10 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy, we need to break down the payments step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   \[
   3 \text{ teeth} \times \$1.00 \text{ per tooth} = \$3.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, half of $1.00 is $0.50.
   \[
   2 \text{ teeth} \times \$0.50 \text{ per tooth} = \$1.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Mark scored as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals Anna scored as follows:
\[
\text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to break down his spending over the week.

First, we calculate how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he spends:
\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. He spends $10 each day for 4 days, so the total spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]
Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After spending $40 on wooden action figures, Peter has:
\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he spends $10 each day, so the total spent on plastic action figures is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he buys is:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the number of wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month and compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a week:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses he grows in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks):
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month by subtracting the number of roses he grows from the number of roses ordered:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The error is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is consistently off by 4%. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( T \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be \( T + 0.04T = 1.04T \). We know this should equal 520 degrees:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her exercise session.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities to find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

To find the total amount of water needed:
- We divide the total calories burned by 200 and then multiply by 100 ml.
- Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

The final numerical answer is:
800"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans in the jar, given the relationships between their quantities and the total number of jelly beans.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of blue jelly beans.
- \( R \) as the number of red jelly beans.
- \( G \) as the number of green jelly beans.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans:
   \[
   R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
   \]
2. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans:
   \[
   G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B
   \]
3. The total number of jelly beans is 4500:
   \[
   R + B + G = 4500
   \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the total number of jelly beans equation, we get:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combine the terms on the left-hand side:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[
R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]
\[
G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than red jelly beans is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we first need to determine the three measurements. The initial speed is 47 WPM, the speed after the first increase is 52 WPM, and the speed after the second increase is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these measurements and then divide by 3.

The sum of the measurements is:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

The average is:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, the protein intake per day is 6 grams. Therefore, the protein intake per week is:
\[ \text{Protein per week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. Therefore, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost for the implants and the porcelain crown is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is \( 30 \) degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is \( 90 \) degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money Colby has in cents. We can do this by converting each type of coin to cents and then summing them up.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents

"First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires make in a month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires make in a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in a month.**

Given:
- Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
- Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.

First, find the number of rotations per mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in 400 miles:
\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the 10,440,000 rotation limit.**

Given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
2. Calculate the cost per wash.
3. Convert the cost per wash to cents.

First, we know that the directions say 2 pumps give 120 washes. Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

The total cost of the bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the total number of washes:
\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash} \]

Since we need the cost per wash in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 0.20 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ cents per wash} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the shirt and the shorts. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount for the shirt is:

"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the meat consumption for each player and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each an ounce in size, and there were 8 beef tips. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

First, we calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection. Since each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights per pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of street lights at all 4 intersections. Since there are 24 street lights at each intersection and there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights per intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights. Since 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

Thus, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"

"First, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s).

Given:
- Ashley's internet speed = 20 kb/s
- 1 Mb = 1000 kb

To convert kb/s to Mb/s, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000:
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s} \]

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the required height. Adam's current height is 40 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount the company paid to acquire these cars:

\[ \text{Total cost paid by the company} = 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we determine the profit James made from selling the cars:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost paid by the company} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James received a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"

   \]

2. **Price of a gold jewel:**
   The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a silver jewel:**
   The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of a silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total price for all three jewels:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of a diamond jewel} + \text{Price of a gold jewel} + \text{Price of a silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for Tom to close the gap, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class and then find out how many classes he can miss without exceeding this cost.

First, let's denote the total cost of the 10 classes as \( C \). The total cost is given as $60. If the cost per class exceeds $10, his parents will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is at most $10.

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{C}{n} \]

We need:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq \frac{60}{10} \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

Now, we sum all these costs:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 43,500
\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is \(\boxed{43500}\) dollars."
"To determine how much money Tim will make in a year after his promotion, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then find the annual salary.

1. **Calculate the raise:**
   Tim's current monthly salary is $20,000. A 5% raise on this salary is:
   \[
   0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
   \]
   So, his new monthly salary after the raise is:
   \[
   20000 + 1000 = 21000
   \]

2. **Calculate the bonus:**
   The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly salary after the raise and bonus:**
   Adding the raise and the bonus to the new monthly salary:
   \[
   21000 + 10000 = 31000
   \]

4. **Calculate the annual salary:**
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual salary is:
   \[
   31000 \times 12 = 372000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tim will make in a year is:
\[
\boxed{372000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the wardrobe components:

1. **Cost of suits:**
   James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \text{ dollars}

"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to consider the daily average publications and the number of days in February.

First, we calculate the total number of articles published by the news website in February:
- The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

\[
\text{Total articles by news website} = 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company in February:
- The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.

\[
\text{Total articles by sister company} = 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles}
\]

Now, we add the total number of articles published by both websites in February:

\[
\text{Total articles} = 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles}
\]

Thus, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:

\[
\boxed{840}

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time taken to dig through the soil and the time taken to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time taken to dig through the soil is:
\[
\text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time taken to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time taken to dig through the clay is:
\[
\text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the times to find the total time taken to dig the well:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

"To find the total number of likes Fishio has on her Instagram post, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of likes after three weeks.
2. Add the 20000 new likes to the number of likes after three weeks.

First, we know that after 1 week, the number of likes was 2000. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. The initial number of likes was 2000, so:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after three weeks, the number of likes was 140,000. If she received 20,000 more new likes recently, we add these to the 140,000 likes:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes is:

"First, let's calculate the final price Clara paid for the 20 pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the final price Sheila paid for the 20 pomegranates on the next day.

The price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final price Sheila paid is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800. The total sales in the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

The total amount she made in two months is the sum of the total sales from the first and second months:

\[ \text{Total sales in two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time period and the free time:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - The total time period is \( 9 \text{ PM} - 5 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \).
   - He gets 1 hour free.

2. **Calculate the paid time period:**
   - The total time is 4 hours, and 1 hour is free.
   - Therefore, the paid time is \( 4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Determine the cost structure:**

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally earned this week.
2. Subtract the amount of money she should have earned (her weekly wage) from the total amount she earned to find out how much was withheld.

First, we know that Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420. This means she earned an additional $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her weekly wage and the amount she earned this week. Therefore, the amount withheld is $300 - $220 = $80.

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of deviled egg halves Lori will need. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \times 2 \text{ whole eggs/deviled egg half} = 96 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on rent. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( s \) as the number of sheep.
- \( g \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs.
2. The total number of legs is 70.
3. The total number of heads is 20.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. \( 4s + 2g = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( s + g = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 20 - s \]

Next, substitute \( g = 20 - s \) into the first equation:
\[ 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( s \):
\[ 4s + 40 - 2s = 70 \]
\[ 2s + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2s = 30 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese:
\[ g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Check the total number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:
\[ s + g = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. To find the cost of the more expensive brand per pound, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/pound} \times 1.20 = 6 \text{ dollars/pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, for a week (7 days), he will use:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:

\[ 42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie.

- 2 bag of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, we sum the costs of these items:
\[ 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600. The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209.

So, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = \text{Total newspapers} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C}) \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
150 - 90 = 60
\]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[
60 \times 6 = 360
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\boxed{360}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each person has and then find out how much each would have if they shared equally after combining their money.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120. Therefore, Kassidy has:
\[
Kassidy = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. We know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna has:
\[
Rayna = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the total amount of money they have together:
\[
Total = Rayna + Kassidy + Aurelia = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share this total amount of money equally among the three of them, each person would get:
\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of management employees in the company. Given that 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. We know that 30% of the management employees oversee the company. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of employees who oversee the company is:

"First, we need to determine the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. We do this by adding the amounts of candy each person has:

\[
3 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to share this total amount of candy equally among the three people. To find out how much candy each person will have, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:

\[
\frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, each of them would have \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5, and Adam bought 7 candies of type A. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75, and Adam bought 10 candies of type B. Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the costs of the candies to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first verify the total number of good, bad, and neutral days over the thirty days.

Christina's mood distribution over the thirty days is as follows:
- Twelve good days
- Eight bad days
- The rest are neutral days

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[
\text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days}
\]

Next, we verify the distribution over the first thirty days:
- First eight days: Good
- Second eight days: Bad
- Third eight days: Neutral

We count the days:
- First eight days: 8 good days
- Second eight days: 8 bad days
- Third eight days: 8 neutral days

Summing these:
\[
8 \text{ (first eight days)} + 8 \text{ (second eight days)} + 8 \text{ (third eight days)} = 24 \text{ days}
\]

Since the total number of days is 30, the remaining days are:
\[
30 - 24 = 6 \text{ days}
\]

These remaining 6 days are the neutral days, which we already know are 10. This confirms the distribution is correct.

Now, we consider the next three days:
- The next three days are: Good, Neutral, Good

We count these:
- Good days: 2 (first and third of the next three days)
- Neutral day: 1 (second of the next three days)

Thus, the number of good days in the next three days is 2.

Initially, Christina had 12 good days. Adding the good days from the next three days:
\[
12 + 2 = 14 \text{ good days}
\]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the difference in height between the target height and the current height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to grow 360 inches:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of toys James needs initially. He currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 4 more toys for the 8 new dogs that have arrived. This means he needs 4 toys for the 8 new dogs.

After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means there are now 8 + 8 = 16 dogs in total. Since he already has 4 toys, he needs 16 - 4 = 12 more toys.

When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed the toys for those 3 dogs. This means he had 16 - 3 = 13 dogs left, and he already had 4 toys, so he needed 13 - 4 = 9 more toys.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- 4 toys for the initial 8 dogs
- 12 toys for the 16 dogs after buying more
- 9 toys for the 13 dogs after 3 dogs left

The total number of toys James needs is 4 + 12 + 9 = 25.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine Skyler's investment, we need to follow the sequence of investments step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in two days. We multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, we can find out how many hash browns one potato can make:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, to find out how many hash browns 96 potatoes can make, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"To determine by how much the elevator will exceed its maximum load, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then compare it to the elevator's maximum load.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:**
   Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of 8 adults} = 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:**
   Jack's weight is not specified, but we assume he is also an adult.
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Jack} + \text{Total weight of 8 adults}
   \]
   Since Jack's weight is also 80 kg:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \, \text{kg} + 640 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Determine the excess weight over the maximum load:**
   The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Maximum load}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Thus, the elevator will exceed the maximum load by \(\boxed{20}\) kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

According to the problem:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Katarina has \( M - 5 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so if Max has \( M \) cookies, then Summer has \( M + 23 \).
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( M - 5 = 68 \).

From the equation \( M - 5 = 68 \), we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Now, we know Max has 73 cookies. Using the relationship \( M = C + 12 \), we can solve for \( C \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. Now we can find out how many cookies Summer has:
\[ M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now we have the number of cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

The total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, so the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

We can set up the following equation to represent the final length of the dress:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time taken for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the times into minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode. Therefore, the time taken for each half is:
- Time for the first half in ""turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- Time for the second half in ""rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Now, we sum these times to find the total time taken to mow the entire lawn:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to get to school. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we subtract the time it takes them to get to the fire station from the total time they have:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time they have to get to school without being late is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda bakes. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta bakes 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies baked} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling, so we subtract these from the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Cookies left in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of the twins and triplets as follows:
- Let the age of one of the twins be \( T \).
- Let the age of one of the triplets be \( T - 7 \) (since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet).
- Let the age of the other triplet be \( T - 7 \) (since all triplets are the same age).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ T + (T - 7) + (T - 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ T + T - 7 + T - 7 = 44 \]
\[ 3T - 14 = 44 \]

Next, we solve for \( T \):
\[ 3T - 14 = 44 \]
\[ 3T = 44 + 14 \]
\[ 3T = 58 \]
\[ T = \frac{58}{3} \]
\[ T = 19.33 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 19.33 \) years.

"First, we need to calculate the total time John spends on his homework. The time spent on each subject is as follows:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equivalent to:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many minutes John has left for napping, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time available:
\[ 180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes John has to nap is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. Let's denote the cost of one candy as \( c \).

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ c = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"First, let's determine how many coins Rong has saved in ten years. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, in ten years (which is 120 months), he will have saved:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we need to find out how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:

\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years (120 months), Neil will have saved:

\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over the ten years:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let the total bill be \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ x = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + x \]

Since \( x = 0.6T \), we can substitute \( x \) in the total bill equation:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the price of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple:
\[
\text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Next, we find the price of one orange. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana:
\[
\text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in a crate:
\[
\text{Total cost for bananas} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in a crate:
\[
\text{Total cost for apples} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in a crate:
\[
\text{Total cost for oranges} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
\text{Total price of the crate} = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:

"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each colored square and then sum these areas.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of each colored square to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
\text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

"First, let's determine the number of high chairs and regular chairs currently available at Mia's restaurant. We know that there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs currently available at the restaurant:

\[ 8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \text{ (total chairs)} \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the number of chairs required:

"First, let's determine the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam** has collected 50 points.
2. **Betty** collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty collected, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Betty} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Marta** collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points. Therefore, Marta collected:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Marta} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
4. **Tom** has 30 points.

Now, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Marta's points} + \text{Tom's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 235 = 165
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."

"First, we need to calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Amount put into retirement account} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses to make her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for this purpose.

\[ \text{Amount used for car payment} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Amount left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To determine how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we first need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. The box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 are missing. Therefore, the number of pencils currently in the box is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

So, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the display:

- Hannah's city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks is:
  \[
  15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ fireworks}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah will see. Since Hannah's house is at a right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, we calculate 40% of 300 fireworks:
\[
0.40 \times 300 = 120 \text{ fireworks}
\]

Additionally, Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks she sets off in her backyard is:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ fireworks}
\]

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the display and the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
\[
120 + 15 = 135 \text{ fireworks}
\]

Thus, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:
\[
\boxed{135}

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person will have a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks for one person:

\[ \text{Cost for one person} = (\text{cost of drinks}) + (\text{cost of snacks}) = (2 \times 2) + (3 \times 2) = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings each person ate and then sum them up.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives us the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes (32%) from the total percentage used by Colorado City:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is \(8\%\).

"First, let's determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops.

First, let's calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00. Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 3 scoops, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of 3 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries picked.

The fixed fee is $20.
The variable fee is $1.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the variable cost is:
\[ 1.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the fixed and variable costs gives the total cost James paid for picking the blueberries:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars} + 45 \, \text{dollars} = 65 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. Therefore, the cost at the store is:
\[ 2.5 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:

"First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since each of the five friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

However, since the two friends who ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas are the same two friends who ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas, we need to subtract the slices they already ate from the total slices they would have eaten if they had not eaten any. The number of slices they actually ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} - 5 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 5 \times 9 - 5 \times 8 = 45 - 40 = 5 \]

So, the total number of slices eaten is:
\[ 40 + 5 = 45 \]

The number of slices left is:
\[ 60 - 45 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes by \( x \) inches. Then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. The final answer is:

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \times 1 = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 32 \times 1.5 = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Now, we sum the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[
64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[

15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} + 40 \text{ (light green)} + 50 \text{ (dark green)} = 150 \text{ spools}
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools. This includes both the light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
15 \text{ (light blue)} + 45 \text{ (dark blue)} = 60 \text{ blue spools}
\]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Now, calculate the percentage:

\[
\left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of blue spools of thread is:

\[
\boxed{40\%}

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of people who voted by midday:**
   - Total people initially: 5000
   - Fraction of people who voted by midday: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
   - Number of people who voted by midday: \( 5000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2000 \)

2. **Calculate the number of people remaining by midday:**
   - Number of people remaining by midday: \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \)

3. **Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00:**
   - Fraction of remaining people who voted by 16:00: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00: \( 3000 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2000 \)

4. **Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:**
   - Number of people remaining by 16:00: \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \)

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are needed based on the total number of pieces of gum.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. So the total number of smores needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores/kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 2 \text{ smores/adult} = 18 \text{ smores} + 12 \text{ smores} = 30 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 30 smores. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to calculate the number of sleeves required:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores/sleeve}} = 3.75 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since we can't buy a fraction of a sleeve, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 4 sleeves of graham crackers.

Now, we need to determine how many boxes of graham crackers are required. Each box contains 3 sleeves, so we calculate the number of boxes needed:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves/box}} = 1.3333 \text{ boxes} \]

Again, since we can't buy a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, they need 2 boxes of graham crackers.

"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
\]
Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
\]
Substituting the father's age (38) into the equation:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

- Math and science books: Each weighs 2 pounds. Since she has two of them, the total weight is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
- English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
- History book: Weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we sum up the weights of all the books:

\[
4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the number of votes candidate A received. Given that candidate A got 20% of the votes, and there were 100 voters, we can calculate the votes for candidate A as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. We subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes to find the votes for candidate C:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, we need to account for the 10 apples that Boris gives to Beck. After giving 10 apples to Beck, Boris will have:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water: 32 ounces.
- Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

1. **Determine Steven's number of books:**
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - Therefore, \( 2S = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Steven has 10 books.

2. **Determine Alice's number of books:**
   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
   - Therefore, \( A = S + 6 \).

"To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of a half-gallon jar.
2. Calculate the cost of 10 gallon jars.
3. Calculate the cost of 16 half-gallon jars.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3.

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2 less than a gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 gallon jars:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of 16 half-gallon jars:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students like to play video games. Let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 50
- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5
- The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of students who like to play video games.
- \( y \) as the number of students who like to play music.

From the problem, we know:
1. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball:
   \[
   y = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

2. The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music:
   \[
   10 + 5 + x + y = 50
   \]

Substituting \( y = 10 \) into the equation:
\[
10 + 5 + x + 10 = 50
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
25 + x = 50
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 50 - 25
\]
\[
x = 25

"First, we need to determine how many birds were scared away by Jeremy throwing the stone. Jeremy saw 12 birds and scared away \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that number. We calculate \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 12 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:

\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:

\[

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   - We subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards, each costing $1800.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards Mark received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50.

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Now, we sum up the values of all the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of the cards} - \text{Total cost} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100

"To determine how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Carl has.
2. Determine how many marbles Cal has.
3. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Next, we know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by doubling the number of marbles Sean has:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Now, we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have to find the total:
\[
\text{Total number of marbles Carl and Cal have} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To determine how many more groups are needed, we first need to find out how many students would be in each group if the 54 students were divided into 12 groups.

We start by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]
Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 equal groups. Therefore, the problem as stated is not feasible with the given numbers.

However, if we interpret the question as asking how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from 54 students, we can calculate the number of groups already formed and then find out how many more are needed.

Since 54 students are to be divided into 12 groups, and we already have 12 groups, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[
12 - 12 = 0
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(20 \text{ days} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\).
- Total chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(8 \text{ days} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 800 \text{ chairs}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\].

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \text{ chairs/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 4000 \text{ chairs}\].

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost per roommate.
2. Calculate the annual cost per roommate.

First, we know the total monthly cost for electricity is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each roommate pays each month:
\[ \text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost per roommate by 12:
\[ \text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent out.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses, and since 1 dozen equals 12, he sent \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, so he sent \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we subtract the broken items from the total sent:
- Remaining glasses: \( 96 - 10 = 86 \)
- Remaining plates: \( 48 - 6 = 42 \)

Now, we sum the remaining glasses and plates:
- Total remaining items: \( 86 + 42 = 128 \)

Thus, the final number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is 128."

"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day of the week.

1. Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
2. Joey played 1 match on Friday.
3. Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we sum the matches played each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{XS} = 11
   \]

2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   \[
   \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   \[
   \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   \[
   \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   \[
   \text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
\text{Total shirts} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

The total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, after the 5% discount, you will pay $133."
"To determine the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists.
2. Determine the total duration of all the songs combined.

First, we know that each playlist contains 300 songs and John has 20 playlists. Therefore, the total number of songs is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. Therefore, the total duration of all the songs combined is:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:

"First, we need to determine the number of people who think horse #2 will win. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This means the remaining number of people is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. Given that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. This means the rest of the people, who think horse #12 will win, is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

We are also told that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister gave him half of her $90 allowance:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, we add this amount to the $70 Jayden already had:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \). According to the problem, the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house will need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]
To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[
x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100
\]
So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs \( x = 100 \) cases of shingles. Therefore, the number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

First, we know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. According to the problem, this is twice as many books as Ahmed read in the same hour. Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as \( A \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 300 = 2A \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

Next, we are told that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed. The total number of books read by Ahmed is 150. Adding the books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we get:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, we calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time spent driving to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since Jack drives the same distance back home, the time spent driving back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent driving is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Next, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \] wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \] wheels.

So, the price you have to pay after the discount is $800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 800 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many movies are in various series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200
\]

This means the number of non-series movies is:

\[
600 - 200 = 400
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 400 movies are older movies. Since 40% of the non-series movies are older movies, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
\]

The remaining non-series movies are not older movies, so we calculate:

\[
400 - 160 = 240
\]

Now, we can determine the cost of replacing the movies. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so:

\[
\text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
\]

The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so:

\[
\text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
\]

The cost for the non-series movies is $10 each, so:

\[
\text{Cost for non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
\]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of replacing the movies:

\[
1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
\]

Thus, the total cost to replace the movies is:

\[
\boxed{4400}

"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both driving and hiking.

First, let's find the speed at which the Llesis family hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed that was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. The driving speed was 50 miles per hour, so half of this speed is:
\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
\]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by hiking. The problem states that they hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. The distance traveled by hiking is:
\[
20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance traveled by driving. The total driving time was 6 hours, and the driving speed was 50 miles per hour. The distance traveled by driving is:
\[
50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance traveled by driving and the distance traveled by hiking:
\[
300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance to the vacation spot is:
\[
\boxed{330}

"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumps on as \( E_A \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_A \). Similarly, let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B_E \). According to the problem, Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Therefore, we can write:
\[ E_A = E_E + 8 \]
\[ B_A = B_E + 3 \]

The points Ava earns are:
\[ \text{Points for enemies} = 10 \times E_A = 10 \times (E_E + 8) = 10E_E + 80 \]
\[ \text{Points for berries} = 5 \times B_A = 5 \times (B_E + 3) = 5B_E + 15 \]
\[ \text{Points for time} = 30 \times (-4) = -120 \]
So, Ava's total score is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 - 120 = 10E_E + 5B_E - 25 \]

Similarly, the points Emma earns are:
\[ \text{Points for enemies} = 10 \times E_E = 10E_E \]
\[ \text{Points for berries} = 5 \times B_E = 5B_E \]
\[ \text{Points for time} = 30 \times (-4) = -120 \]
So, Emma's total score is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_E + 5B_E - 120 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E = (10E_E + 5B_E - 25) - (10E_E + 5B_E - 120) = 10E_E + 5B_E - 25 - 10E_E - 5B_E + 120 = 95 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cost of Four Pizzas:**
   The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.

2. **Cost of Two Pizzas:**
   Two of the pizzas cost $30 each.

3. **Total Cost of the Two Known Pizzas:**
   The cost of the two pizzas is:
   \[
   30 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of the Other Two Pizzas:**
   The total cost of the four pizzas is $64. Therefore, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:
   \[
   64 \text{ dollars} - 60 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Each of the Other Two Pizzas:**
   Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

   \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They ride for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
- They ride for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify this solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding these fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish (16) is indeed twice the number of white fish (8).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel consumed in a week.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week.**

Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles. Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

For 5 days, the total distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel consumed in a week.**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel consumed for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed in a week.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of 140 quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on the twenties. She spent 3/5 of the 10 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total value of the twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[
\boxed{142}

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much more money John needs after accounting for the school's contribution.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school's contribution is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

John currently has $50. After the school's contribution, the remaining amount John needs is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

Since John already has $50, the additional amount he needs is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, John is missing \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the temperature inside the house during the night. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees, and it is 33 degrees colder at night. Therefore, the temperature at night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Since the temperature during the night is 12 degrees, which is below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

The difference between the current temperature (12 degrees) and the temperature needed to prevent freezing (32 degrees) is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing 90 by 9:
\[
90 \div 9 = 10
\]
So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to determine how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells. Therefore, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]
So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

At the next stop, 38 people get off. The number of people on the train after the second stop is:

\[ 151 - 38 = 113 \]

So, the final number of people on the train is 113.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 113 \]"
"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottle caps Damien collects in a 30-day month.
2. Determine the value of these bottle caps in dollars.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. Therefore, in a 30-day month, he will find:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Next, we know that each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of 300 bottle caps is:
\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

So, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is:

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

Her special hourly rate, which is 150% of her regular hourly rate, can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie earned for her regular 8 hours of work and for the additional hours she worked.

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings:
- For the 8 regular hours: \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \)
- For the 3 additional hours: \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \)

Adding these amounts together gives her total earnings for the day:
\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and then sum all the lions.

"To determine how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Subtract the discounted price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by 25% (or 0.25):

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ \text{Discounted price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money Mike will have left after buying the jeans. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the discounted price from $50:

\[ \text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.
3. Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).

**Step 1: Determine the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months).**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine the total time Carrie and the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total duration of singing both ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice.
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Deck the Halls""} = 2 \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once.
- Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Jingle Bells""} = 1 \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:

\[
\text{Total caroling time} = 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is:

\[
\boxed{540 \text{ seconds}}

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
- **Initial earnings (first 2 months):**
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times \$10 \text{ per hour} = \$200
  \]
- **Earnings after 2 months:**
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
  \]
- **Earnings on his first anniversary:**
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
  \]

Next, we sum up Billy's total earnings over the period:
\[
\$200 + \$210 + \$230 = \$640
\]

Now, let's find Sally's hourly wage:
- **Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary:**
  \[
  \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
  \]

Next, we calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
\]

Finally, we determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally:
\[
\$640 - \$210 = \$430
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Adding 11 to this value gives us Nikita's points:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add the points scored by Pierson and Nikita:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teachers. Since there are 3 teachers per class, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by the students and the teachers gives the total number of trees planted:

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then find out how many stuffed goats are needed to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30%.

First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:
\[
3 \text{ (puppies)} + 5 \text{ (koalas)} + 2 \text{ (zebras)} + 4 \text{ (frogs)} = 14 \text{ stuffed animals}
\]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so we set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):
\[
x = 0.30 (14 + x)
\]

Next, we distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[
x = 4.2 + 0.30x
\]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[
x - 0.30x = 4.2
\]
\[
0.70x = 4.2
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[
x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
\]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. Therefore, the total number of hours she has played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours she has played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods, the total number of hours Kris has played so far is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the number of miles that will separate the two cars is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Adding these together gives:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost of the ring to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the pass rates for each grade and then find the average of these rates.

First, let's determine the pass rate for the third graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for third graders} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \]

Next, the pass rate for the fourth graders is given as:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fourth graders} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \]

For the fifth graders, the pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders:
\[ \text{Pass rate for fifth graders} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \]

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate by taking the average of the pass rates for the three grades:
\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80}{3} = \frac{1.88}{3} \approx 0.6267 \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.6267 \times 100 \approx 62.67\% \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is:
\[ \boxed{62.67\%} \]"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine the total area of the mosaic he can create with the chips he has.
3. Use the area to find the length of the mosaic.

First, we calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we know that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. Therefore, the total area of the mosaic he can create is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by the product of its length and height:
\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Order and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 butterscotch candies.

2. **Remaining Candies After Sales:**
   - Since Dale sold 150 candies but only had 100 ordered, he would have run out of candies and would need to order more.
   - Therefore, he sold all 100 candies he initially had and needed to order more to meet the demand.

3. **Additional Order:**
   - Dale ordered 100 more candies to replenish his stock.

4. **Total Candies Now:**
   - Dale now has 100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies.

5. **Total Candies Ordered:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, totaling 200 candies.

6. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - Dale has 200 candies and has already sold 150 candies.

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week. We know that he made $105 and that each branch he climbs costs $0.25.

First, we calculate the total number of branches he climbed:
\[
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. Since he made $105 during the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:
\[
\text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{7} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picks:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Next, Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives the number of petals remaining in the vase:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean each need one marshmallow for each S'more, and they have 14 marshmallows left, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the number of S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total playtime and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

First, let's convert the total playtime from hours to minutes:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the playtime for each person:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- One friend can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
  \[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]
- Another friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is:
  \[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]
- The third friend is significantly worse and can play for half as long as Jack, which is:
  \[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total playtime for all four friends:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes (Jack)} + 10 \text{ minutes (friend 1)} + 30 \text{ minutes (friend 2)} + 10 \text{ minutes (friend 3)} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Since each quarter allows 20 minutes of play, we need to determine how many quarters are required for 240 minutes of play:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the quantities of each ingredient as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt used.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil used.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest used.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance used.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar used.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( C = F \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \), and \( C = F \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) and \( F \) with \( S \). Therefore, we have:
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( S = C \)
- \( F = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients:
\[ S + O + C + F + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. Converting this to a decimal, we get approximately 3.33 ounces, but the exact answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{10}{3}} \]"
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total costs of the goats and the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4500}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars and gives away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars he gives away is \(8 + 16 = 24\) cars.
   - Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is \(40 - 24 = 16\) cars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she spent walking each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. 

Next, we need to calculate the time she spent walking on the second day. According to the problem, she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she spent walking on the second day is:
\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent walking over the two days:
\[
8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

Since the question asks for the total time in minutes, we need to convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate how many cars left the parking lot during the lunch break.
3. Find out how many cars remained in the parking lot after the lunch break.

Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, he counted 20 more cars, so the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left the parking lot is:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot after the lunch break is:
\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.

   Therefore, the earnings per cycle are:
   \[
   5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle}
   \]

   Now, calculate the daily earnings:
   \[
   30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days in a week.

   Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00

"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate the points scored in each game separately and then sum them up.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

2. **Second Game:**
   - Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points.

Now, we sum the points Sasha scored in both games:
- Points scored by Sasha in the first game: 14
- Points scored by Sasha in the second game: 4

Total points scored by Sasha:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then the refund amount from Amazon. Finally, we'll find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The cost for the weight is \(4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - The cost for the distance is \(20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}\).
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}\).

2. **Calculate the refund amount from Amazon:**
   - The purchase price of the book is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - The refund amount is \(32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the shipping cost minus the refund amount.
   - The net loss is \(3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars}\).

"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok videos in a month is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs each week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent writing songs is:

Thus, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is \(\boxed{1128}\) minutes."
"To determine the cost for Angela, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

First, let's identify the base cost and the additional cost for the items Angela needs.

1. **Base Cost Calculation:**
   - The base cost for the installation is $129.00.
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The base cost already includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
   - Therefore, Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

2. **Additional Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost for each additional item is $15.00.
   - Angela needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.
   - Total additional cost = 2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 items.
   - Additional cost = 13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Total cost = Base cost + Additional cost
   - Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covers during each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

First, we calculate the distance he travels in the first part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

The distance for the first part is:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he travels in the second part of his journey:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours

The distance for the second part is:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the animals and the time it takes for them to travel the same distance.

First, let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \) and the speed of the kangaroos as \( v \). The time taken by the kangaroos to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{v} \]
We know that the total time taken by 3 kangaroos is 18 hours, so:
\[ \frac{D}{v} = 18 \]
This means the distance \( D \) is:
\[ D = 18v \]

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). The time taken by each turtle to travel the distance \( D \) is:
\[ \text{Time for one turtle} = \frac{D}{\frac{v}{2}} = \frac{D \cdot 2}{v} = \frac{2D}{v} \]
Since \( D = 18v \), we have:
\[ \text{Time for one turtle} = \frac{2 \cdot 18v}{v} = 36 \text{ hours} \]
Therefore, the time taken by four turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
\[ \text{Time for four turtles} = 4 \times 36 = 144 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the highway is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job.
3. Use the information that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop to find out how much money she has in her purse.

First, the original price of the laptop is $600. With the trade-in discount of $200, the final price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Erika has after receiving the additional money from her mom and her part-time job:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = \text{total money} \]

We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total money she has is $50 less than the final price of the laptop:
\[ \text{total money} = 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 150 + 80 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ 230 + \text{money in her purse} = 350 \]
\[ \text{money in her purse} = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

1. A large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Adam slices 3 large apples:
   \[
   3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. A small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Adam slices 5 small apples:
   \[
   5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. Adding the slices from the large and small apples together:
   \[
   15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. Adam eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices:
   \[
   30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of apple slices left is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently.
2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters.
3. Calculate how many more cows are required to produce the additional milk needed.

First, the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

Next, the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 mm
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \) mm

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 mm
   - Used portion: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) mm

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 mm
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) mm

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[ 10 \text{ mm} + 4 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} = 20 \text{ mm} \]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, let's determine the total amount of money Gabriel has:
\[ \text{Money from weekends} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from his brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
\[ \text{Money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money Gabriel has} \]
\[ \text{Money needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

So, Gabriel still needs:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig has to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into this equation, we get \( 60 = 2S \), which means \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we need to find the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so together Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so together Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only)
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only)
- The rest are good at both math and English.

The number of students good at both math and English is:
\[ B = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes. Each group requires 10 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The original investment (principal, \( P \)) is $300. The annual interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is:
\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, and \( t \) is the time in years.

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

First, calculate the interest:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025. Adding this to the original investment gives the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

Thus, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of white shirts with collars and the number of white shirts without collars.

- Total white shirts: 40

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and the number of floral shirts without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts without collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

The difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts without collars.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5. Since he has 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the farmer will earn:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
2. Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm.
3. Sum the remaining goats from both farms.

First, we know that Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. The number of goats sold from Farm Y is twice the number sold from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

Next, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:
- Farm X initially had 55 goats and sold 10 goats, so the remaining goats in Farm X are \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- Farm Y initially had 45 goats and sold 20 goats, so the remaining goats in Farm Y are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we sum the remaining goats from both farms:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

Thus, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes bought.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 3 baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the 3 baskets of red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- Normally, 3 baskets of red food would cost \( 3 \times 18 = 54 \) dollars.
- However, there is a $2 discount for each basket of red food.
- Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The cost of the 3 baskets of red food after the discount is \( 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food to find the total amount to be paid:
- The total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Thus, the final total amount to be paid is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned: One-half of 90 rooms is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms: Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required to clean 45 rooms is \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, the number of hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms is 15 hours."
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
3. In the third year, the town builds double the total number of homes built in the first two years. First, we calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   Then, the number of homes built in the third year is:
   \[
   2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[
12 + 36 + 96 = 144

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( Y \):
- From \( Y = S + 2 \), we get \( S = Y - 2 \).
- From \( Y = B - 3 \), we get \( B = Y + 3 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \), substituting \( B = Y + 3 \) gives \( M = 3(Y + 3) - 1 = 3Y + 9 - 1 = 3Y + 8 \).

Now we substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ Y + B + S + M = 87 \]
\[ Y + (Y + 3) + (Y - 2) + (3Y + 8) = 87 \]
\[ Y + Y + 3 + Y - 2 + 3Y + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y + 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6Y = 78 \]
\[ Y = 13 \]

So, your age is \( \boxed{13} \)."

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have some extra glue sticks left over, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the given changes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water After the First Day:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Amount of Water After the Second Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the amount of water becomes:
   \[

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can express this relationship as:

\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = \text{Number of silver coins} + 30 \]

Given that the number of gold coins is 70, we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = \text{Number of gold coins} + \text{Number of silver coins} \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."

"First, let's determine the number of each type of car in the bumper car rink.

1. **Red Cars:**
   The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:**
   The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Blue Cars:**
   The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Next, we isolate \( A \) by subtracting 37 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Then, we solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Since Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, we calculate the number of books Fawn has as follows:
\[ A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes. Since the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds and the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the bag of carrots. The problem states that the bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg wants to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required. We know that one box of jello makes 10 small jello cups. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final amount Greg will spend on jello is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 500 \]"
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost that Madeline pays.
2. Calculate the total monthly cost that Keenan pays.
3. Determine the weekly cost that Keenan pays.

First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month. Madeline pays 60% of this amount. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, the amount Keenan pays is:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the weekly cost for Keenan is:
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the amount Keenan spends per week is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} = 10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Pieces eaten on the third day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Total pieces eaten so far**:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost per bottle of soda and per bottle of water.

Given:
- Seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Four bottles of water cost $8.00.

First, we calculate the cost per bottle of soda:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of water:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we determine the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
\[ \text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"

"To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find her hourly rate. We know that Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. Therefore, her hourly rate can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Total hours worked}} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she would earn for 12 hours of work at this hourly rate. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = \text{Hourly rate} \times 12 = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him more marbles. Initially, Paul has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles. So, the total number of marbles Paul has now is:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving the additional marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, we need to determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell by 2:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah. Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, so the difference is:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Thus, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost for Sarah's friend to buy the 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{\$/meter} = 40 \, \text{\$}
\]

Next, we determine how much money Sarah will have after selling the rope. Since she sells it for $2 per meter, the total amount she will receive is:

\[
\text{Total money received} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{\$/meter} = 40 \, \text{\$}
\]

Sarah plans to use this $40 to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. We need to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40:

\[
\text{Number of meters} = \frac{40 \, \text{\$}}{1.5 \, \text{\$/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters is:

\[
\text{Cost for 26 meters} = 26 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/meter} = 39 \, \text{\$}
\]

Finally, we calculate how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope:

\[
\text{Money left} = 40 \, \text{\$} - 39 \, \text{\$} = 1 \, \text{\$}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age first. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now as \( x \). In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We want this age to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Thus, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly is buying.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones can be paired.
3. Divide the number of pairable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

First, we calculate 20% of the 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]
So, 10 microphones won't fit in pairs.

Next, we subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]
So, 40 microphones can be paired.

Finally, we divide the number of pairable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

\text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

Next, we need to find the total number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. We calculate the total number of birds feeding as follows:

\[
\text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding}

3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.
4. Determine the number of flowering plants.
5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of indoor plants.**

Given that one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants:
\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants.**

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants.**

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:
\[

"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to first find the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

First, we know the cost of the salad is $6. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the cost of the yogurt is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of one carrot be \( x \) dollars. Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of the carrots is:
\[ 2x \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of her daily diet is the sum of the cost of the carrots, the salad, and the yogurt:
\[ 2x + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2x + 9 = 11 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 2 \]

Then we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His original hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Therefore, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \) and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \).

The payment Tasha received from mowing lawns is calculated as follows:
- Joe's lawn: \( 6 \times x = 6x \) dollars.
- Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3x = 18x \) dollars.
- Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5x = 30x \) dollars.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54x \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( x \), we can infer that the total amount from mowing lawns must be a whole number and fit within the total earnings. Given the context, we can solve for \( x \) by ensuring the total earnings equation holds true. However, since the problem does not specify \( x \) further, we can assume the simplest case where \( x = 1 \) (as it is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).

If \( x = 1 \):
\[ 54x = 54 \]

"First, let's determine the weight of Carl. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of Christian. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we need to determine Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 74 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ rentals/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/rental} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so the total earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, we need to determine John's profit. His profit is the total earnings minus his monthly car payment. His car payment is $500 per month, so his profit is:

\[ 750 \text{ dollars/month} - 500 \text{ dollars/month} = 250 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, Martha has a total of 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can calculate the number of notebooks Martha originally had as follows:

\[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. We do this by subtracting the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Martha's total notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we start by calculating the distance Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional miles Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional miles Anis rowed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Adding this to the 50 miles Dijana rowed, we get the total distance Anis rowed:

\[
\text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we find the total distance both Dijana and Anis rowed by adding their individual distances:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, let's determine how many pages each person read over the two days.

**Denise's Reading:**
- Yesterday: 10 pages
- Today: 10 + 5 = 15 pages

**Daniel's Reading:**
- Yesterday: 13 pages
- Today: 0 pages

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days.

**Denise's Total Pages:**
\[ 10 \text{ (yesterday)} + 15 \text{ (today)} = 25 \text{ pages} \]

**Daniel's Total Pages:**
\[ 13 \text{ (yesterday)} + 0 \text{ (today)} = 13 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel.

\[ 25 \text{ (Denise's total)} - 13 \text{ (Daniel's total)} = 12 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin is an adult, so the pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of adult bowls in the pot:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult bowls.

4. **Calculate the number of child bowls in the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls and 8 child bowls, we need to find the ratio of adult to child bowls.
   - The ratio of adult bowls to child bowls is 4:8, which simplifies to 1:2.
   - Therefore, for every 1 adult bowl, there are 2 child bowls.

5. **Determine the number of child bowls in the pot:**
   - Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, it can also fill \(4 \times 2 = 8\) child bowls.

6. **Calculate the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - There are 2 children, and the pot contains 8 child bowls.
   - Each child can have a bowl of soup \(\frac{8 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 4\) times.

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought five notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought one ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Thus, William spent a total of \(\boxed{8.00}\)."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is:
     \[
     20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is:
     \[
     8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total material needed:**
   - Adding the material needed for the small and large masks:
     \[
     10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

Thus, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies that Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 movies and she has seen each one three times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 - 40 = 18 \]

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3:
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:

"First, we need to determine the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we know that Lana has 27 cups of tea and she divides these into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of cups in each row is \( 2x \).

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]

This means:
\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total time available for picking berries**: 8 hours.
2. **Total berries to be picked**: 24 berries.
3. **Time taken for one trip**: 4 hours (down the tree, pick berries, and climb back up).

First, we need to find out how much time is available for picking berries. Since the total time is 8 hours and the time taken for one trip is 4 hours, the time available for picking berries is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trips the sloth can make in the available 4 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make in 4 hours is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 1 \text{ trip} \]

Since the sloth can only make 1 trip in the available 4 hours, the number of berries he can pick up in that trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{1 \text{ trip}} = 24 \text{ berries} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the items he has already purchased.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
- Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn.
- Therefore, the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- Candy costs $2 per box.
- Colby had 4 boxes of candy.
- Therefore, the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- The total spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from his total monthly budget:
- Colby's monthly budget is $150.
- Amount spent on popcorn and candy is $24.
- Therefore, the remaining budget is \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many movies Colby can see with the remaining budget. We know that tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, and tickets for other days cost $7 each. Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days. We need to calculate the cost of these movies:
- Cost of 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- Cost of 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- Total cost of these movies is \(50 + 56 = 106\) dollars.

Subtract the cost of the movies already seen from the remaining budget:
- Remaining budget after seeing the movies is \(126 - 106 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we need to determine how many more movies Colby can see with the remaining $20. Since tickets for other days cost $7 each, we can see:
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{20}{7} \right\rfloor = 2 \) more movies on other days.

Therefore, the total number of additional movies Colby can see is:
- 2 movies on other days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, we need to determine the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for each mini pastry as follows:

- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins:

- The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls is \( 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories/mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \).
- The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins is \( 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories/mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \).

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:

\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \( 85000 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 85000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 - 240 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie has and then subtract this total from the number of toys she has for her nephew.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's nephew has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls are in the tube, we subtract the total number of other toys from the total number of toys for her nephew:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of water balloons each person had:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so each friend received \(2\) water balloons.
- Maria herself received \(1\) water balloon.

So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding Maria's water balloon:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:
- Each of the 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends) received 3 more balloons.

So, the total number of additional water balloons given by her mom is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial total number of water balloons to the additional balloons:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale. 

The charity group has 10 people who each donate 5 boxes of stuff, so the total number of boxes donated is:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. Therefore, the total number of boxes available is:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes donated} + 10 \text{ boxes already owned} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. Thus, the number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables are needed, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required:
\[ 30 \text{ tables needed} - 15 \text{ tables owned} = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the daily, monthly, and total earnings for each machine.

First, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the Widgeteer 3000:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the Widgeteer 3000 are \(1440 \times 6 = 8640\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(8640 \times 30 = 259200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the daily production and earnings for the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily production is \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- Each widget sells for $6.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from the WidgetMaster 9000 are \(1080 \times 6 = 6480\) dollars.
- For a month with 30 days, the total earnings are \(6480 \times 30 = 194400\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference in earnings is \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

Thus, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the cost of gas, which is $50. So, after spending $50 on gas, his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract this amount from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much money John has left after buying 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for 5 pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money, we get:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled out by Craig and his brother, we start by calculating the total number of letters Craig has spelled out.

Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:
\[
20 \times 15 = 300
\]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is:
\[
300 + 50 = 350
\]

To find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the number of letters Craig spelled out to the number of letters his brother spelled out:
\[
300 + 350 = 650
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[

"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the earnings from each type of root crop separately and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.

Thus, Jen will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the 20-mile lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The remaining distance is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"First, let's determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery had last Friday. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can set up the following equation to find the number of loaves the bakery had:

\[
\text{Number of loaves the bakery had} = 7 \times \text{Number of loaves Sam had} - 40
\]

Substituting the number of loaves Sam had:

\[
\text{Number of loaves the bakery had} = 7 \times 70 - 40
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
7 \times 70 = 490
\]

Then, we subtract 40 from 490:

\[
490 - 40 = 450
\]

Therefore, the bakery had 450 loaves of bread last Friday. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{450}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem with variables and equations.

Let's denote:
- Marcus's age by \( M \)
- Leo's age by \( L \)
- Deanna's age by \( D \)

From the problem, we know:
1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age: \( M = \frac{1}{2}L \)
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna: \( M = D - 5 \)
3. Deanna is 26 years old: \( D = 26 \)

First, substitute Deanna's age into the second equation:
\[ M = 26 - 5 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now, we know Marcus is 21 years old. Using the first equation, we can find Leo's age:
\[ M = \frac{1}{2}L \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2}L \]

To solve for \( L \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ L = 21 \times 2 \]
\[ L = 42 \]

Thus, Leo is 42 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we isolate \( A \) by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Then, we solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

"First, we need to determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

To find the total time in minutes:
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Convert hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Divide the total minutes by the number of minutes per interval: \( 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Since Vince staples 30 reports per interval, we can now calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: \( 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \).

Thus, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking.

   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Determine the actual time Kim was awake:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at \( 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \).
   - The time from 5:55 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. is 5 minutes.
   - Adding the time spent sleepwalking: \( 5 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Calculate the actual sleep duration:**
   - Total time awake: 28 minutes.
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Actual sleep duration: \( 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. He has two dozen measuring cups, and since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of beds that are unoccupied initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, and 50 patients are admitted each day.

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

We add the number of patients admitted to the initial number of occupied beds to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. This is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Shawna's age.
2. Use Shawna's age to find her father's age.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
\[
\text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
\]

Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:
\[
\text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
\]

Thus, Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\) years old."
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement reported by Courtney. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but then filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in 2 holes:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the third day was 27, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips given the conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of corn chips each person received:**
   - Amora received 70 corn chips.
   - Lainey received 70 corn chips.
   - Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey.

2. **Calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:**
   - Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.

3. **Sum the total number of corn chips:**
   - Total corn chips = Corn chips received by Amora + Corn chips received by Lainey + Corn chips received by Collins
   - Total corn chips = \(70 + 70 + 85\)

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - Total corn chips = \(70 + 70 + 85 = 225\)

Thus, the total number of corn chips is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To determine the cost of travel, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

First, we calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation:

\[
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
\]

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\[
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the equation for \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"To determine the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the length of each episode.
2. Determine the number of episodes based on the given relationship.
3. Calculate the total time spent watching the show.

Given:
- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

First, let's denote the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes.

Next, we need to find the number of episodes, \( E \). The problem states that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore:
\[
E = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[
\text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:
\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance traveled:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."
"First, let's determine the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then account for the ones eaten and given away.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen brownies for herself.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, 4 dozen brownies were waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}

"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother as \( D \) and \( B \) respectively.

First, we know that Emil is currently 19 years old. When Emil turns 24, the number of years that will have passed is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

At that time, Emil's age will be 24, and his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \). According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]

To find \( D \), we solve the equation:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that at the same time (when Emil is 24), Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2B \]
\[ B = 12 \]

So, Emil's brother is currently 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 12 = 55 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of crawfish he has. Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the number of pounds per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band. These 6 students will need to leave early to travel to the away game. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are size \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is given by the sum of their shoe sizes divided by 2. So, we add the sizes of Charlie's and Sophie's boots and then divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's size} + \text{Sophie's size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Thus, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to fill her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long. Each plant is 12 inches wide, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Therefore, the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is:

\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/plant}} = 111 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet of space between every plant. The total space taken up by the plants and the spaces between them can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total space taken} = 111 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (111 - 1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 111 \text{ feet} + 110 \times 1.5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 111 \text{ feet} + 165 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Total space taken} = 276 \text{ feet} \]

Since the flower bed is only 111 feet long, it is clear that Pat cannot fit 111 plants with 1.5 feet of space between each plant. We need to find the maximum number of plants that can fit in the 111 feet, considering the 1.5 feet of space between each plant.

Let \( n \) be the number of plants. The total space taken by \( n \) plants and \( n-1 \) spaces between them is:

\[ n \text{ feet} + (n-1) \times 1.5 \text{ feet} = 111 \text{ feet} \]
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat can fit 45 plants in her flower bed. Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. Since his brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate the number of pretzels his brother eats per day as follows:
\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels his brother eats per day by 7:
\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar's brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week is:
\[
\boxed{63}
\]"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the plants in one basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket, and each petunia costs $3.00.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias per basket} = 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00
  \]
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of sweet potato vines per basket} = 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00
  \]

Next, we add the costs of the petunias and sweet potato vines to find the total cost per basket:
\[
\text{Total cost per basket} = \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Katherine has 5 baskets, so we multiply the total cost per basket by 5:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 baskets} = 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used by the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used by the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total soil used by the sunflowers and carnations combined:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil available for planting roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Thus, the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can save in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's determine how long it will take her to saute 30 shrimp. According to the information given, she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Since we need to saute 90 shrimp, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[
\text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the total time required to peel and saute 90 shrimp. Since the tasks can be done sequentially (one after the other), we add the time required for each task:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and saute 90 shrimp is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the total cooling and the total warming to find the net change in temperature:

- Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
- Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).

Net change in temperature:
\[ 18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees during the period when the air conditioner is off, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

Therefore, the room is \(\boxed{14}\) degrees higher than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age difference between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet:
- The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the second sighting is 75 years after the first sighting.
- Therefore, Bill was 90 years old 75 years after he was \(x\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

We can set up the following equation to find \(x\):
\[ 90 = x + 75 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 90 - 75 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 22 \]"
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum these durations.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, calculate the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the Combined Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him.

Adam's mother gave him $6.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we add the amounts given by his mother and father:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on new trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"To find Wilfred's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the average age of the group:**
   The total age of the children is 20. Since there are 4 children, the average age is:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Express Helene's age in terms of the average age:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. Therefore, Helene's age is:
   \[
   \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total age of the children:**
   The total age of the children is the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, and we have Helene's age. Let Wilfred's age be \( W \). The equation for the total age is:
   \[
   3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20
   \]

4. **Solve for Wilfred's age:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   17 + W = 20

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

The total amount collected from these sources is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. Walter's friend will contribute $200.

Now, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. According to the problem, Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund is $2000, and Walter's friend will contribute $200. The total amount collected from everyone else (neighbors and online fund) is:
\[ 2000 - 200 = 1800 \]

The lawyer will donate three times this amount:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer will contribute:
\[ \boxed{5400} \]"
"To determine how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies.
2. Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.
3. Calculate the number of people in the church next door based on the number of cookies given.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.**

There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies were given to the church next door.**

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door.
\[
\text{Cookies given to the church} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church next door.**

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.
\[
\text{Number of people in the church} = \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people}
\]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the proportion of the watermelon that each adult and each child receives, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Let the volume of each child's slice be \( x \). Then, the volume of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume of the watermelon \( V \) is equal to \( 8x \). Therefore, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( V \):
\[ x = \frac{V}{8} \]

Now, we calculate the volume of each adult's slice:
\[ 2x = 2 \left( \frac{V}{8} \right) = \frac{2V}{8} = \frac{V}{4} \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\frac{V}{4}}{V} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Thus, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on each activity:

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours.
2. Time spent on rounds: 20 minutes per inpatient, and there are 9 inpatients.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} \times 9 \text{ inpatients} = 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment, and there are 10 appointments.
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes/appointment} \times 10 \text{ appointments} = 300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Next, we sum up the time spent on all activities:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, along with the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( p \):
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ p = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( m \):
\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, we need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total population will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the number of gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

We know that 1 cubic foot is approximately equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48 \]

\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48 \]

\[ G = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = G \times 0.10 \]

\[ C = 10472 \times 0.10 \]

\[ C = 1047.20 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. According to the problem, there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To determine the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine how many gallons of water are remaining in the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
- Tank capacity = 18000 gallons.
- Wanda's contribution on the first day: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
- Ms. B's contribution on the first day: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the first day: \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Wanda's contribution on the second day: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- Ms. B's contribution on the second day: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped on the second day: \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped: \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

**Remaining Water in the Tank:**
- Tank capacity: 18000 gallons.
- Remaining water: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Calculating \( 0.91^5 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.652 \]
So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours. This means that after an additional 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.652 \times 0.93^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]
So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is approximately:
\[ C \times 0.652 \times 0.817 \approx C \times 0.531 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ C \times 0.531 = 0.28 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.531} \approx 0.528 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.528 \) or 52.8%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is 20% of $10000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Janet to save $2000 at a rate of $1000 per week. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet will need to work to save the down payment is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's sum up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits, he will have:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. Since she bought a box containing 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs of sweets for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

This means the number of pieces of sweets that Anne gave to her friends is:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P(t) \) is the price after \( t \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars.
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal).
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P(3) \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.
2. **Albums**: She divided these pictures into 8 albums.
3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 albums were for selfies only.
   - 2 albums were for portraits only.
   - The remaining albums were for other categories.

First, calculate the number of albums that were not for selfies or portraits:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pictures were in the selfies albums and the portraits albums. Since the problem does not specify the distribution of the remaining 3 albums, we assume they are distributed among selfies and portraits.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of selfies.
- \( P \) as the number of portraits.

From the problem, we know:
\[ S + P = 72 \]

We also know:
\[ S = 3 \text{ (since 3 albums are for selfies)} \]
\[ P = 2 \text{ (since 2 albums are for portraits)} \]

However, since the total number of pictures is 72 and we have 5 albums (3 for selfies and 2 for portraits), the remaining 3 albums must be distributed among selfies and portraits. Let's denote the number of pictures in the remaining 3 albums as \( x \).

Thus:
\[ S + P + x = 72 \]
\[ 3 + 2 + x = 72 \]
\[ 5 + x = 72 \]
\[ x = 67 \]

So, the number of selfies and portraits are:
\[ S = 3 \]
\[ P = 2 \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ S + P = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early. This reduces the number of guests by 24.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

3. **Guests who checked out late:**
   15 guests checked out late. This further reduces the number of guests by 15.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current total:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]

5. **Additional guests who checked in after dinner:**
   7 more guests checked in after dinner was served. Adding these 7 guests:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Thus, the current number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is given as $4. Since large stuffed animals are sold at three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, the total revenue from the sales can be expressed as:

\[ 12L + 4S = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the revenue equation, we get:

\[ 12L + 4(2L) = 120 \]
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we can find the number of small stuffed animals sold:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Adding these together:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Thus, the family eats a total of 77 sandwiches in one week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{77} \]"
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a day.
3. Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month.

**Step 1: Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe.**

A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine twice as much as with an iron pickaxe, and 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds per day, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 \times 2 + 12 \times 0.5 = 24 + 6 = 30 \text{ pounds per day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a day.**

If one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 30 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves can mine:
\[ 40 \times 30 = 1200 \text{ pounds per day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month.**

Since there are 30 days in the month, the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month is:
\[ 1200 \times 30 = 36000 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36000} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. This means that the cost of the sandwiches is directly proportional to the number of sandwiches in the package.

First, let's find the cost per sandwich for each package size:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we need to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches. Using the cost per sandwich:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. 

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons.

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 8 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (blue added)} = 35 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of convincing the teacher to give a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario:
     - If no extension is given: 60% (0.60)
     - If an extension is given, Marcus can still convince the teacher: 20% (0.20)
     - Total probability of not having to turn in homework in this scenario: 60% (0.60) + 20% (0.20) = 80% (0.80)
     - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 20% (0.20)

Now, we combine the probabilities from both scenarios:

- Probability of having to turn in homework if a substitute teacher is present: 50% (0.50)
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present: 20% (0.20)

Total probability of having to turn in homework:
\[ 50\% + 20\% = 70\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's determine her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is:

\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time required to place the candy in each bottle.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and place the candy, and there are 7 intervals between the 8 bottles, the total time is:
\[
7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in college, we need to calculate the total amount of money he borrowed and the total income he lost.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed:
- Jim took 4 years to finish college.
- He borrowed $50,000 per year.
- Therefore, the total amount borrowed is:
  \[
  4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim lost while in college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 annual income.
- After college, his income tripled, so his new income is:
  \[
  3 \times \$25,000 = \$75,000 \text{ per year}
  \]
- The income he lost per year is:
  \[
  \$75,000 - \$25,000 = \$50,000 \text{ per year}
  \]
- Over 4 years, the total income lost is:
  \[
  4 \text{ years} \times \$50,000 \text{ per year} = \$200,000
  \]

Now, we add the total amount borrowed and the total income lost:
\[
\$200,000 \text{ (borrowed)} + \$200,000 \text{ (lost)} = \$400,000
\]

Finally, we need to determine how long it would take Jim to earn $400,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year:
\[
\frac{\$400,000}{\$75,000 \text{ per year}} = \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 5.33 years to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income lost while in school.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5.33}

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, calculate the dimensions of one piece of fabric:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[
\text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[
\text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
\]

Thus, the total number of square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.**

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.

First, calculate one-fifth of the Monday's delivery:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
\]

Then, add 17 to this amount:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]

So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]

Then, add 5 to this amount:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]

So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.**

Add the number of letters delivered on each day:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{736}

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- Number of people who want chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50

\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people who want pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad: $6

\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for both salads to find the total amount Molly will pay:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 65 + 36 = 101
\]

Thus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:

\[
\boxed{101}

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 in the first race, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to this, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars. Therefore, he did not lose any money in the second race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, we sum up the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost = $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \approx 7.17
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

"To determine the total population in South America, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cities in South America.
2. Multiply the total number of cities by the population of each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population in South America is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, we need to convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. Let's use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters.
3. Find the total number of hours worked by each painter.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all painters is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/hour} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ hours} \div 4 = \frac{63}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{63}{32} \text{ hours} \]

Converting \(\frac{63}{32}\) to a decimal gives:
\[ \frac{63}{32} = 1.96875 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours each painter put in is:
\[ \boxed{1.96875} \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year from 2007 to 2010.

The initial price of the car in 2007 is $20,000. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

Let's calculate the price of the car at the end of each year from 2007 to 2010.

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18

"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, we calculate the increased monthly cost. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. Since the cost increased by 60%, we need to find 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increased cost per month} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $72. Adding this to the normal monthly cost gives us the total monthly cost after the accident:

\[ \text{Total monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the total monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ twin beds}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of loads needed for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
  \[
  \frac{1 \text{ king bed}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
  \]

Now, we sum the loads for the twin beds and the king size bed:
\[
2 \text{ loads (twin beds)} + 1 \text{ load (king bed)} = 3 \text{ loads}
\]

Since Greg does this every week, we need to find out how many weeks are in a year:
\[
52 \text{ weeks in a year}

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all cats per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Silvia ate. The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

To find the total slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we sum the slices each of them ate:

\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we sum these amounts:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by the number of days in a 5-day work week.

First, we know that James gets 80 emails a day and 20% of these emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes visited as on Monday.
   \[
   2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ classes}
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes visited as on Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 32 = 96 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]
\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

Thus, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:
\[
\boxed{247}

"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:

\[
20 - 14 = 6
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas}
\]

The football team ate 80% of these pizzas.

\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
\]

So, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:

\[
40 - 32 = 8
\]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left.

\[
6 + 8 = 14
\]

Thus, the total number of pizzas left is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send.
2. Calculate the total cost for mailing the small coupons.
3. Calculate the total cost for mailing the big coupons.
4. Sum the costs from steps 2 and 3 to get the total cost.

First, we know Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to get the total cost:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many meatball sub sandwiches Mark ate. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of meatball sub sandwiches left after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 7 = 10 \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 10 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Number of Trucks**: Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.
2. **Fertiliser per Truck**: Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
3. **Total Fertiliser Initially**: 
   \[
   20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
   \]

4. **Mechanical Failures**: A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. 
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]

5. **Remaining Trucks**: 
   \[
   20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]

6. **Fertiliser Remaining**: 
   \[
   15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \).

Next, we need to account for the promotion:
- The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

To find out how many pounds Dennis needs to buy to get 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we can use the following logic:
- For every 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound.
- Therefore, for 6 pounds, he will pay for \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) pounds.

Now, we calculate the cost:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Dennis needs to pay for 3 pounds of butter.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 3 \text{ pounds} \times 4 \text{ dollars per pound} = 12 \text{ dollars} \).

Thus, the final cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 45\)

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who could not come:

- Guests who could not come: 4
- Guests who will attend: \(45 - 4 = 41\)

The base rental fee for the movie theater is $125, and there is an additional fee of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. Since 41 guests are attending, the number of additional guests is:

- Additional guests: \(41 - 20 = 21\)

The additional fee for these 21 guests is:

- Additional fee: \(21 \times 6 = 126\)

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party by adding the base rental fee and the additional fee:

- Total cost: \(125 + 126 = 251\)

Thus, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially. So, \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \).

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) dollars.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) dollars. Therefore, the amount of money Riza has left is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) dollars.

The total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is \( 45 + 40 = 85 \) dollars.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day and then find out how many bananas the third monkey eats.

1. Calculate the number of bananas the first monkey eats each day:
   \[
   \text{First monkey's daily consumption} = 10 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of bananas the second monkey eats each day:
   \[
   \text{Second monkey's daily consumption} = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption by first two monkeys} = 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

4. Determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the total consumption of the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas available for a week:
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for a week} = 315 \text{ bananas}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for a day} = \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third monkey's daily consumption} = 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas/day}
   \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens of roses Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen (12 roses), we can calculate the cost as follows:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{15}{12} \right\rceil = 2 \text{ dozens} \]
So, the cost for 2 dozens of roses is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she is short:
\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive in change. Since $5 is equivalent to 20 quarters, Jenny will receive 20 quarters in change.

The final numerical answer is:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the first train's stay time (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

The total time Paul will wait for his train is \(\boxed{85}\) minutes."
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

The blueprint requires 200 toothpicks in total. Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks, so the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one jellyfish is created.
   - Therefore, in one hour (which has 3600 seconds), one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.
   - In one minute (which has 60 seconds), one spring creates \(60\) jellyfish.
   - In one second, one spring creates \(1\) jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - One hour has 3600 seconds.
   - Therefore, 4 hours have \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.
   - In 14400 seconds, one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates \(14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - James walks halfway to the store.
   - The distance to the store is 4 miles.
   - Halfway is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - Time taken for the first segment: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - James realizes he forgot something and walks back home.
   - The distance back home is 2 miles.
   - He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

"First, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches.

The cost of each bunch is $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we find the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

"To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[
\text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the growth over 13 years at this rate. We multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour workday, we need to calculate the net change in the number of bales of hay over that period.

First, let's calculate the number of bales the farmer makes in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales made by the farmer} = 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of bales the truck picks up in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Bales picked up by the truck} = 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we find the net change in the number of bales of hay by subtracting the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ \text{Net change in bales} = 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Since the net change is positive, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:
\[ \text{Bales left} = 12 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each period is 40 minutes long.
   - Therefore, John spends \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes in class each day.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, he spends \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes in class each week.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100\) minutes on Saturday and Sunday each week.

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - Total time in class each week: 1600 minutes.
   - Extra learning time each week: 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time John spends learning each week is \(1600 + 100 = 1700\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time John spends learning each week in hours is \(\frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33\) hours.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from the third-floor balcony is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Therefore, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at a rate of $5 per bag, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of bags sold:**
   - Each bag contains 10 apples.
   - The total number of apples sold is 2000.
   - Therefore, the number of bags sold is:
     \[
     \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Each bag is sold for $5.
   - The number of bags sold is 200.
   - Therefore, the total earnings are:
     \[
     200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means that \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors scavenged.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is 270 kilograms. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony needs to paint. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 6 sodas (2 shaken and 4 unshaken).
   - We need to find the probability that the friend picks a shaken soda.

4. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The total number of sodas left is 6.
   - The number of shaken sodas left is 2.
   - The probability that the friend picks a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas left.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

5. **Converting the Probability to a Percentage:**

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33.33\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{33.33\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at a speed of half of 60 miles per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{270}

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people transported by the buses and the cars, and then sum these numbers.

First, we calculate the number of people transported by the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

\[
12 \times 35 = 12 \times (30 + 5) = (12 \times 30) + (12 \times 5) = 360 + 60 = 420
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people transported by the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people transported by the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

Now, we sum the number of people transported by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest slide: 60 feet/minute

The time \( t_1 \) to slide down the biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_1 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest slide: 80 feet/minute

The time \( t_2 \) to slide down the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
t_2 = \frac{\text{Length of the slide}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = t_1 - t_2 = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \).

Since 40% of the total number of students is equal to 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ N = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls in the school, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]

4. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, so we subtract this amount from his remaining total:
   \[
   27 - 19 = 8
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Out of this $14, she has already spent $4. Therefore, the amount spent on the books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount. Let's denote the cost of each book by \( x \). Therefore, the total cost for the 2 books is:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost Anna $5. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year after a 20% increase, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate 20% of the number of students enrolled last year.
2. Add this increase to the number of students enrolled last year.

First, calculate 20% of 50 students:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, add this increase to the number of students enrolled last year:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine how long it will take the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we first need to find out the rate of blinking. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's garden pond.

**Initial counts:**
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's account for the additional fish Tate buys.

**Additional fish:**
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase.

**Total counts after purchase:**
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we find the total number of male and female fish.

**Total number of male fish:**
\[ 6 \text{ (male guppies)} + 5 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 11 \]

**Total number of female fish:**
\[ 8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16 \]

Finally, we determine how many more female fish there are than male fish.

\[ 16 \text{ (female fish)} - 11 \text{ (male fish)} = 5 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time for Megan: \( 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Dior did laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Time for Dior: \( 4 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \) (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" implies more than 4 hours, we assume the minimum additional time is 4 hours, making it 8 hours).

Now, we sum the times for all three chores:
\[
4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{22}\) hours."
"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time:**
   John drives for 2 hours one way.

2. **Determine the speed:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance one way} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian.

Given:
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
\[
\text{Total distance Sofie walks in 7 days} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
\]

According to the problem, this total distance is twice the distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we have:
\[
70 \text{ miles} = 2B
\]

To find \( B \), solve for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(6 + 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(4 + 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since each of the four workers works for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in one shift is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in the shift, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for a 10-hour shift, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog weighs:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. So, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Therefore, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. Therefore, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it takes Alfie to fly that distance.

First, we calculate half of the circumference of the earth:
\[
\text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the faster car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Vince's current age based on the information given.

1. Liam's current age is 16 years.
2. Two years ago, Liam's age was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years.
3. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \(x\). Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   14 = 2x
   \]
4. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
   So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old.
5. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know from the problem that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each. Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box will weigh 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes together gives:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs he can make is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, John cuts each of these 16 logs into 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Valerie's brother's salary.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Determine their mother's salary.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother's salary is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach segment is 2 miles long. Since she walks at a certain speed on the beach, we can calculate her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk segment is 1 mile long. The time spent walking on the sidewalk can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent walking by summing the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks.

\[
4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[
60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jane needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take her to save $28.

\[
\frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

\[
7

"To find the total number of blue birds in all the trees, we need to sum the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the initial number of marbles Bob has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After this, he is able to drink the water, meaning the temperature of the water in his water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \). After pouring 1 ounce from the second mug, the temperature of the water in the second mug becomes \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce is 1/5 of the total volume of the second mug). The temperature of the water in the water bottle from the second mug is then \( \frac{T}{5} \).

The total temperature of the water in the water bottle after pouring is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from the two mugs. Since 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug are mixed, the total temperature \( T_{\text{total}} \) of the water in the water bottle is given by:

\[ T_{\text{total}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times \frac{T}{5}}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + \frac{T}{5}}{5} = \frac{660 + T}{25} \]

We know that this total temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{660 + T}{25} \geq 40 \]

To find the minimum temperature \( T \) of the second mug, we solve the inequality:

\[ 660 + T \geq 1000 \]
\[ T \geq 340 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 340 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{340} \]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then multiply by the number of days in three weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added per day:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added per day:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Now, let's determine the total number of days in three weeks:
- Three weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of cows added over three weeks:
- Total cows added = 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Then, we calculate the total number of chickens added over three weeks:
- Total chickens added = 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the total number of cows and chickens added:
- Initial number of cows = 50 cows.
- Initial number of chickens = 20 chickens.

Total number of cows after three weeks:
- Total cows = Initial cows + Total cows added = 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
- Total chickens = Initial chickens + Total chickens added = 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

Finally, we find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:
- Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens = 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The final numerical answer is:
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the discounted total cost is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell receives with the 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs contain:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total discounted cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We know that 1 less than 3 scoops is:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can calculate the number of potatoes needed for 2 scoops as follows:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we need to break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Eggs eaten in the first 30 days} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Eggs eaten in the next 30 days} = 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Adding the eggs consumed over the two periods gives the total number of eggs consumed in 60 days.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs).
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}

1. Identify the number of green jellybeans.
2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

First, we know that there are 17 green jellybeans. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34. \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans}) = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9. \]

Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of trees Tim grows:**
   Tim grows 5 trees.

2. **Determine the number of lemons collected per tree per year:**
   Each year, Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree.

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected per year:**
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years in a decade:**
   A decade is 10 years.

5. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade:**
   \[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers on the bus is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

Next, we need to determine how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight at the next stop:
- Initial number of women = 54
- Women who alight = 20
- Women remaining = \(54 - 20 = 34\)

Thus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to first find out how many sunflowers he sold per day and then multiply by 3.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. Faraday earns $56 from the bouquets per day. Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[
\frac{56}{8} = 7
\]
Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:
\[
7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales. Each sunflower costs $2 and Faraday earns $26 from the sunflowers per day. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the sunflowers sold from the individual sunflowers:
\[
84 + 13 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:
\[
97 \times 3 = 291
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{291}
\]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of rocks Adam sells:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 60\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$84
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of buying the rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times \$5 \text{ per rock} = \$100
   \]

5. **Determine the loss:**
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Cost} - \text{Revenue} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16
   \]

Thus, Adam loses \(\boxed{16}\) dollars."

     \]

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized picture scenes is:
     \[
     \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
     \]

Next, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first establish the probabilities of each ticket being a winner.

1. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket being a winner is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[
0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
\]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \), which simplifies to \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \), which simplifies to \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and on weekends separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- He eats 4 carrots each weekday.

\[
\text{Carrots eaten on weekdays} = 5 \text{ weekdays} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends:
- There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
- He eats 5 carrots each day on the weekend.

\[
\text{Carrots eaten on the weekend} = 2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots}
\]

Now, we sum the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on the weekend to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

\[
\text{Total carrots eaten in a week} = 20 \text{ carrots (weekdays)} + 10 \text{ carrots (weekend)} = 30 \text{ carrots}

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices bought.
3. Determine the total revenue from selling the mobile devices.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.**

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the mobile devices bought.**

Linus bought 2 mobile devices last Monday and 4 mobile devices last Tuesday.
\[ \text{Total cost} = (2 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling the mobile devices.**

Linus sold all the mobile devices he bought.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 40) = 80 + 160 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, we calculate the total number of bottles needed:
- Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
- Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \)).
- For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

Next, we determine how many more bottles are needed:
- Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
- The number of additional bottles needed is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \).

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of babies wearing bows and the number of babies wearing purple, and then find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (but since we can't have a fraction of a baby, we'll consider 1 baby for practical purposes)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is given by the ratio of the number of babies wearing bows and purple to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of babies wearing bows and purple}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( 66.67\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 66.67 \]"

"First, let's determine the total area of land Abraham initially owned. He owns 80 square meters of unused land.

Next, we calculate the area sold in the first transaction:
- Abraham sold half of his land, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
- He sold this land for $50.

Then, we calculate the area sold in the second transaction:
- Abraham sold \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his land, which is \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.
- He sold this land for $30.

Now, we determine the remaining area of land:
- The total area sold so far is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) square meters.
- The remaining area is \( 80 - 60 = 20 \) square meters.

Finally, we calculate the revenue from selling the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter:
- Revenue from the remaining land is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

To find the total money Abraham will earn, we sum the revenues from all transactions:
- Revenue from the first transaction: $50
- Revenue from the second transaction: $30
- Revenue from the remaining land: $60

     \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll determine how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope \( B \) is:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope \( R \) is:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) \]

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope \( Y \) is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is:

"Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as \( R_r \) and the amount given to Ronnie as \( R_n \). According to the problem, Ronnie was given $5, so \( R_n = 5 \). Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so \( R_r = 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]
So, we have:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]
This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]
Thus, the amount left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, the amount of white paint is also \( R \) and the amount of purple paint is also \( R \).

The amount of yellow paint is half the mural, so it is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

The total amount of paint used is the sum of the amounts of red, white, purple, and yellow paint:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find \( R \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[
\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[
\text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[
\text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet}
\]

The remaining area of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, we sum up all the areas to find the total area of the house:
\[
\text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area}
\]
\[
\text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[
\boxed{3160}

"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box of dishwasher pods, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods}
     \]
   - Add this to the original number of pods:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12.
   - The new box contains 120 pods.
   - Calculate the cost per pod:
     \[
     \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1:
     \[
     \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles}
     \]

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, we determine the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws from the bank. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. He then converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by each team in the entire match:
- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
\[6 + 10 = 16\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left and how many days he can continue using it at a rate of 20% per day before he has to recycle it.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of Monday. Therefore, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Usage Rate**: The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. Let's denote the remaining chalk length after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). Initially, \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
4. **Chalk Length After \( n \) Days**: The chalk length after \( n \) days can be calculated as:
   \[
   L_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n
   \]
   We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( L_n < 2 \) inches (since the teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches).
5. **Finding \( n \)**: We need to solve the inequality:
   \[
   2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2.75:
   \[
   (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \approx 0.7273
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln(0.7273)
   \]
   Using the property of logarithms \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \):
   \[
   n \ln(0.8) < \ln(0.7273)
   \]
   Since \( \ln(0.8) \) is negative, we divide both sides by \( \ln(0.8) \) and reverse the inequality:
   \[
   n > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.8)}
   \]
   Calculating the values:
   \[
   \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.3105 \quad \text{and} \quad \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   n > \frac{-0.3105}{-0.2231} \approx 1.39
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n = 2
   \]
   So, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys who are not on varsity.

The number of girls not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity}
\]

The number of boys not on varsity is:
\[
12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity}
\]

Finally, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity to find the total number of students not on varsity:
\[
8 + 9 = 17
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"First, let's determine how many face masks Mike bought. According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

Next, we need to calculate how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times (\text{Number of masks Mike bought}) + 2 \]

Substituting the number of masks Mike bought (5):

\[ \text{Number of masks Johnny bought} = 3 \times 5 + 2 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth drilled by the dentist.
2. Calculate the number of teeth capped by the dentist.
3. Find the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

Step 1: The number of teeth drilled is given as 4.

Step 2: The number of teeth capped is 7 more than the number of teeth drilled. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Step 4: To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and was returned.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books he can buy per $500:

\[
\text{Number of books per $500} = 100
\]

Next, we need to find out how many $500 units are in $27,000:

\[
\text{Number of $500 units in $27,000} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each $500 unit allows him to buy 100 books, the total number of books he can buy with $27,000 is:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Bob distributes the $27,000 among 3 schools. Therefore, the number of books he can buy per school is:

\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. One of these apples landed on Newton's head, leaving one apple on the ground.
3. Newton picked up the remaining apple, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
4. Now, there are 5 apples on the ground. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
5. Now, there are 6 apples on the ground. Newton picked up all of these 6 apples and went home to make a pie.

Let's count the apples Newton put in his pocket:
- From the first apple that fell on his head, he put 1 apple in his pocket.
- From the 5 apples that fell after he threw the first one, he put 4 apples in his pocket (since he kept 1 for himself).

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends and then figure out how many whole pizzas are required to meet this demand.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed is \(6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed is \(4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many whole cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese pizza slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizzas are required for the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni pizza slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas and both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 whole pizzas, the total number of pizzas she needs to buy is:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total miles are:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total miles are:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net rate of snowballs Jay can produce per hour is:
\[ 20 - 2 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he produces 12 snowballs per hour, the time \( t \) in hours required to produce 60 snowballs is:
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"If John is currently 28 years old and he is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

Given that John is 28 years old:

\[ 28 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age} \]

To find Jim's age, we divide John's age by 2:

\[ \text{Jim's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim is 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of apple slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother, we start by identifying the number of slices each person ate.

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Next, we sum the slices eaten by each person:
\[
1 \text{ (Doxa)} + 2 \text{ (sister)} + 3 \text{ (brother)} = 6
\]

Thus, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to, which means they had 3 extra bandages left.

Since the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and we calculated that they had 81 bandages after ordering and using the bandages, the discrepancy is due to the extra 3 bandages they had left. This means they started with \(78 - 3 = 75\) bandages on the first day.

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is:

\[ 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches} \]

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars per inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and the color is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 7.5 \times 1.5 = 11.25 \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Days per week} = 11.25 \times 6 = 67.5 \]

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April and Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the additional $10 for each of the 4 weeks:
\[ \text{Additional earnings for attendance} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate her total earnings for April:
\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks} + \text{Additional earnings for attendance} = 67.5 \times 4 + 40 = 270 + 40 = 310 \]

"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in after that.
   - Number of people who came in after 10:00 = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who entered in the evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry after 10:00: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Sum the number of red and black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as the red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost per bottle of cognac. The problem states that the cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on both scotch and cognac by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}
\]"
"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted over the two days is:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after each event and then divide by the number of people at the party.

1. **Initial amount of root beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons on the first day.

2. **After the children drank 4 gallons:**
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie spilled 7 gallons:**
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Ronnie drank 5 gallons:**
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party:**
   The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among 3 people.
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons per person}
   \]

Thus, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.**

There are 66 fish in total, and one-third of them have red stripes.
\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes.**

Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.
\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.**

Five-ninths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

**Step 4: Sum the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.**

Add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has:

- Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors. So, the total number of colors from the palettes is:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
  \]

- Amy has three makeup sets, each with six colors. So, the total number of colors from the makeup sets is:
  \[
  3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
  \]

- Adding the colors from the palettes and the makeup sets, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially has is:
  \[
  8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
  \]

Next, her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes. This reduces the total number of eyeshadow colors by the number of colors in one palette:
\[
4 \text{ colors}
\]
So, the number of colors left after the palette is stolen is:
\[
26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors}
\]

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
\]
So, the number of colors left after using up half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[
22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors}
\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's house and the height of the first floor.

Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times as high as he is:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors:
\[ \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the floor of the second floor} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Determine the number of shells remaining after team Alphas.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:
\[
\text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
\]

Next, we find out how many shells are left after team Alphas:
\[
\text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
\]

Then, we calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, who found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
\[
\text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
\]

Finally, we determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells:
\[
\text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168
\]

Thus, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:
\[
\boxed{168}

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk per day, we can use the information given about the average distance walked by all four dogs.

The total average distance walked by the four dogs per day is 3 miles. The distances walked by the first three dogs are 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles respectively. Let's denote the distance walked by the last dog as \( x \) miles.

The total distance walked by all four dogs is the sum of the distances walked by each dog:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 3 \text{ miles} \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 3 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 3 - 8 \]
\[ x = -5 \]

Since a negative distance doesn't make sense in this context, it indicates there might be an error in the problem's setup or interpretation. However, based on the given data and the average, the last dog needs to walk 5 miles per day to achieve the average of 3 miles per dog.

Thus, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{5}\) miles per day."
"First, we need to determine the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We need to calculate 60% of $100,000.

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

\[
\text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Thus, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:

\[
\boxed{40000}

First, let's find the total weight of the tunas:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the tunas. Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total cost is:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]

   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed over all settings:
\[
3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, we need to determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the problem, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:
\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we need to find the combined capacity of both schools. We add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's school:
\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is:
\[
\boxed{150}

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the cost of the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount Ali has to pay John is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece will be \( 4x \) feet. According to the problem, the total length of the board is 40 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \):

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of meat needed:**
   Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the amount of meat required as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning required is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Amount of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

Thus, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"First, we need to determine the total width of all the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, the total width is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 350 \]"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute.
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.2/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of the 36-minute call.
\[
\$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cupcakes Carly made. Let's break down the information given:

1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
2. There are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats.
3. Therefore, the total number of treats is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \(C\) and the number of brownies as \(B\). According to the problem, we have:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting \(B\) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \(C\):
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. To verify, we can calculate the number of brownies:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure.
2. Apply the 20% discount for getting both services.
3. Add the cost of nail art to the discounted total.

First, let's find the cost of both a manicure and a pedicure without any discounts:
- Cost of a manicure: $35
- Cost of a pedicure: $40
- Total cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75

Next, we apply the 20% discount:
- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Total cost after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Now, we need to add the cost of nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (assuming she has 10 fingers):
- Cost of nail art per finger: $3
- Total cost for nail art: 10 fingers * $3 per finger = $30

Finally, we add the cost of the discounted services to the cost of the nail art:
- Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

Thus, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of issues Susan receives from each magazine:

1. From the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. From the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. From the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since Susan receives 66 issues in total, and each issue corresponds to one magazine, the total number of magazines she gets every year is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation for the number of paintings Samantha has as:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To find \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we will calculate the price step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The initial price of the toy in November is $40.

2. **Price in December:**
   In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in December} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price in January:**
   In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease in January} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Thus, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both his standard lessons and his lessons for veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
- The total earnings from these lessons are:
  \[
  4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per hour} = \$320
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the lessons for veterans:
- Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 25% off his standard rate.
- The reduced rate is:
  \[
  \$80 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \text{ per hour}
  \]
- The total earnings from these lessons are:
  \[
  2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per hour} = \$120
  \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[
\$320 + \$120 = \$440
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Calculate the mean**: Divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sum all the scores**:
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130
   \]
   \[
   130 + 80 = 210
   \]
   \[
   210 + 60 = 270
   \]
   \[
   270 + 40 = 310
   \]
   \[
   310 + 90 = 400
   \]
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 70 = 570
   \]
   \[
   570 + 60 = 630
   \]

   So, the sum of all the scores is 630.

2. **Count the number of scores**: There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the mean**:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of the scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{630}{9} = 70
   \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve has 5 pomelos left.

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
15
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them. So, the number of apples he ate is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
\]
After eating 24 apples, the number of apples remaining is:
\[
60 - 24 = 36
\]
Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. So, the number of apples he gave to his sister is:
\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9
\]
After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples remaining is:
\[
36 - 9 = 27
\]
Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:
\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]
Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can represent the number of novels she has written this year as \( x \). According to the problem, 3 quarters of \( x \) is equal to 9 novels. This can be written as:

\[ \frac{3}{4} x = 9 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents.

First, we calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know the total number of hours he travels. Assuming he travels every day without stopping, we can calculate the distance traveled in one day and then multiply by 3.

The distance traveled in one day is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} = 1200 \text{ km/day} \]

So, the distance traveled in 3 days is:
\[ 1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage 3600 km is of the total distance between Alaska and Texas, which is 6000 km. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of grapes used at each step.

1. **Grapes eaten by Madeline:**
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother:**
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes used by her brother is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Grapes remaining after her brother:**
   The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = \text{Remaining grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes used to make pies:**
   Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

5. **Total grapes at the beginning:**
   Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = 48
   \]
   Solving for the total number of grapes at the beginning:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} = 48 + 36 = 84
   \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then extend that to a yearly cost.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\).

Adding these costs together gives the weekly cost:
\[
1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
\]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00.

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:
\[
10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

However, this percentage seems unreasonably high, so let's recheck the interpretation. The custodian works 8 hours a day, and they need 20 hours to clean all classrooms. This means they cannot complete the task in 5 days if they work 8 hours each day. The question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning, which is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \times 100 = 250\% \]

But since the task cannot be completed in 5 days, the question might be asking for the average percentage of their day spent cleaning if they were to work continuously. The correct interpretation is that they would need to work more than 8 hours a day to complete the task in 5 days. The percentage of their day spent cleaning is:

\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the capacity of each shelf and then the total capacity of the bookcases.

1. **Middle shelves:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves.
   - Total capacity of the middle shelves: \( 10 \text{ books/shelf} \times 2 \text{ shelves} = 20 \text{ books} \).

2. **Bottom shelf:**
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Capacity of the bottom shelf: \( 2 \times 10 \text{ books} = 20 \text{ books} \).

3. **Top shelf:**
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Capacity of the top shelf: \( 20 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 15 \text{ books} \).

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Total capacity of one bookcase: \( 20 \text{ books (middle)} + 20 \text{ books (bottom)} + 15 \text{ books (top)} = 55 \text{ books} \).

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - Number of bookcases required: \( \frac{110 \text{ books}}{55 \text{ books/bookcase}} = 2 \text{ bookcases} \).

Thus, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all 110 books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs}
\]

Rose plans to sell the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[
60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[
20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.

   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the original price of the bag of beef jerky. The original price is $18.00.

Since there is a $3.00 discount, the sale price of the bag is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

The bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the sale price of the bag by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick in dollars is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Thus, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. This can be written as:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96. The final numerical answer is:

     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes in.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

Thus, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights per room, and there are 8 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 2 \times 8 = 4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms, so 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, and 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - The total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Number of Candles and Flashlights:**
   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of the number of flashlights and the number of candles.
   - This is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to find out how many robots, helmets, and footballs are present in the changing room. We know from the problem statement that there are 20 helmets and that the number of robots is half the number of helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs.

First, let's find the number of robots. Since there are 20 helmets and the number of robots is half the number of helmets:
\[
\text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, let's find the number of footballs. Since the number of helmets is half the number of footballs:
\[
\text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"To determine the total time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the hop on land and the swim in water. The total distance is 200 yards, with half of the distance being on land and the other half in water. Therefore, each segment is 100 yards.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. The speed on land is 20 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{hop}} \) to hop 100 yards is given by:
\[
t_{\text{hop}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. The speed in water is 10 yards per minute. The time \( t_{\text{swim}} \) to swim 100 yards is given by:
\[
t_{\text{swim}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time \( t_{\text{total}} \) to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:
\[
t_{\text{total}} = t_{\text{hop}} + t_{\text{swim}} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, and Bob needs 7 boxes, so we multiply 7 by $2.00:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. Identify the cost of the main phone. According to the problem, the main phone costs $20.
2. Determine the cost of each additional phone. The problem states that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. Calculate the total cost of the additional phones. There are four additional phones, each costing $10. So, the total cost for the additional phones is $10 * 4 = $40.
4. Add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to find the total cost of the phone plan. The total cost is $20 (main phone) + $40 (additional phones) = $60.

Thus, the total cost of the whole phone plan is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the number of people present each day and then find the total for the week.

First, let's find the number of people on each day:
- On the first day, there were 50 people.
- On the second day, there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.
- On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

Let's denote the number of people on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people seen each day for the rest of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days) is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over these three days is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]
So, we have:
\[ x + x + x = 180 \]
\[ 3x = 180 \]
\[ x = 60 \]
This means there were 60 people on each of the fourth, fifth, and sixth days.

Now, we can find the total number of people seen over the entire week by summing the number of people from each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 400 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we need to break down the problem into the different time intervals and calculate the number of kernels that pop in each interval.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 2 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate of popping is three times the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 2 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = \(3 \times 2 = 6\) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(6\) kernels.

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The rate of popping is four times the initial rate.
   - Initial rate = 2 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = \(4 \times 2 = 8\) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(8\) kernels.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The rate of popping is half the rate of the previous 30 seconds.
   - Rate of the previous 30 seconds = 8 kernels per 30 seconds.
   - New rate = \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) kernels per 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels that pop = \(4\) kernels.

Next, we account for the kernels that pop from the residual heat after the pan is taken off the heat. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat.

- Kernels that pop from residual heat = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 4 = 1\) kernel.

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped during the cooking process and from the residual heat:

\[
2 \text{ (first 30 seconds)} + 6 \text{ (next 30 seconds)} + 8 \text{ (next 30 seconds)} + 4 \text{ (final 30 seconds)} + 1 \text{ (residual heat)} = 21

   Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. Therefore, he needs:
   \[
   4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon:**
   The extra gallon is twice as tart as the other gallons, so it will also require 1 cup of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Convert the total lemon juice needed into lemons:**
   Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 5 cups of juice is:
   \[
   5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:

"To determine the number of red blocks, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given.

Let:
- \( B \) be the number of blue blocks.
- \( Y \) be the number of yellow blocks.
- \( R \) be the number of red blocks.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of blue blocks \( B = 4 \).
- The number of yellow blocks \( Y = 2 \times B = 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can express the total number of blocks as:
\[ B + Y + R = 32 \]

Substituting the known values of \( B \) and \( Y \) into the equation:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Thus, the number of red blocks is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year, which is $6300.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year, which is $4410.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528

"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length (\( l \)) = 20 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (20 + 15)
\]

First, add the length and the width:

\[
20 + 15 = 35
\]

Next, multiply the sum by 2:

\[
P = 2 \times 35 = 70
\]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{70}

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, and Mia is younger than Emma, we can calculate Emma's age as follows:

\[ \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56 \]

Now that we know Emma is 56 years old, we can find the average of their ages. The average of two numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

So, the average of their ages is 48. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"

"To determine how much Avery will spend on the place settings, we need to calculate the cost of one complete 3-piece place setting and then multiply by the number of people (12).

A place setting consists of:
- 1 dinner plate
- 1 salad plate
- 1 bowl

The costs are:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

First, we calculate the cost of one place setting:
\[
\text{Cost of one place setting} = \text{Cost of dinner plate} + \text{Cost of salad plate} + \text{Cost of bowl}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of one place setting} = 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 12 place settings:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of one place setting} \times \text{Number of place settings}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00
\]

Thus, Avery will spend \(\boxed{180.00}\) on place settings."

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over that period.

First, let's find out how much feed one pig eats in a day:
- Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.
- Therefore, one pig eats \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of feed per day.

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption for all five pigs in one day:
- Since there are five pigs, the total feed consumption per day is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) pounds.

Now, we determine the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
- The total feed consumption in a week is \(40 \times 7 = 280\) pounds.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the total feed consumed in a week from the total feed ordered:
- The amount of feed left is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.
2. Determine the number of packs of hot dogs required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.**

John invited 20 guests, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of packs of hot dogs required.**

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the number of additional hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the packs of hot dogs.**

Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 6 packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$2/\text{cupcake} = \$40 \]

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$40 \]

So, the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
\[ \$40 + \$40 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies. Each tray costs $4:
\[ 5 \text{ trays} \times \$4/\text{tray} = \$20 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the trays from the total revenue to find out how much money Frances has left:
\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Frances has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the end of the third street, there are 30 children following the truck. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[25\]"
"To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she planned to distribute.

First, we calculate the total number of meals given out over the three days:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Adding these together:
\[ 64 + 30 + 48 \]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
\[ 64 + 30 = 94 \]
\[ 94 + 48 = 142 \]

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the number of meals given out from the total number of meals planned:
\[ 1360 - 142 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 1360 - 142 = 1218 \]

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is:
\[ \boxed{1218} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin into cents and then sum them up.

2. A nickel is worth 5 cents. Since James has two nickels, the total value of the nickels is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.
3. A dime is worth 10 cents. Since James has seven dimes, the total value of the dimes is \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, we add the values of the quarters, nickels, and dimes together:
\[25 + 10 + 70 = 105\]

So, the total amount of money James has is \(\boxed{105}\) cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to sum the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

1. The ages of the sisters are all 16 years old. Since there are 3 sisters, the total age of the sisters is:
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48
   \]

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old. The problem states that this age is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, the age of the older brother is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24
   \]

3. The total age of the brothers is:
   \[
   12 + 24 = 36
   \]

4. Adding the total ages of the sisters and the brothers together gives:
   \[
   48 + 36 = 84
   \]

Thus, the total age of all the siblings is:
\[
\boxed{84}

"To determine the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Meditation Time:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes every day.
   - She meditates twice a day (once when she wakes up and once before she goes to sleep).
   - Therefore, her daily meditation time is \(15 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
   - There are 5 days in a week when she practices yoga, so she meditates for 2 days a week (the other 3 days she practices yoga).
   - Thus, her weekly meditation time is \(30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ minutes/week}\).
   - Over 4 weeks, her total meditation time is \(60 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 240 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Yoga Time:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) every day she practices yoga.
   - She practices yoga 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, her weekly yoga time is \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week}\).
   - Over 4 weeks, her total yoga time is \(300 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Total Time Spent:**
   - Adding the total meditation time and the total yoga time gives us the total time spent on both activities.
   - Total time spent = \(240 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 1440 \text{ minutes}\).

Converting the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 1440 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24 \text{ hours}}\)."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum these values.

For the large t-shirts:
\[ 6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we sum the square footage from all the t-shirts:
\[ 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is:
\[ \boxed{101} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds in a small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower. We add the seeds from one small sunflower and one large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many pens Sarah has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pens Timothy has.
2. Use the number of pens Timothy has to find out how many pens Sarah has.

First, we know that George has 18 pens. According to the problem, Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pens George has} = 3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Next, we know that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pens Sarah has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
\]

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The store offers a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. This means that for every two T-shirts, Jake pays full price for one and only 50% of the price for the second T-shirt.

The cost for the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost for the second T-shirt is $8 \times 0.5 = $4.
So, the total cost for the two T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is $40 \times 0.40 = $16. Therefore, the sale price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we sum the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends:
$12 + $24 = $36.

Thus, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance from doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, his total allowance is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
\[ $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \times $44 = $440 \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \times $50 = $500 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ $500 - $440 = $60 \]

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.

"To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.

\[
\text{Total holes dug} = 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
\]

Next, let's determine the net change in the number of holes over time when Nate returns:
- Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day.
- The dog continues to dig 6 holes per night.

The net change in holes per day is:
\[
9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes:
\[
\text{Number of days to fill} = \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
\]

Finally, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
\]

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"First, we need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High School}
\]

Given that the enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we need to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
\]

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075. So, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chocolate chip cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Rainbow cookies} - \text{Oatmeal cookies} \]
\[ \text{Number of chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 2595 - 3075 \]

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

\[ 7995 - 2595 = 5400 \]
\[ 5400 - 3075 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each item Igor gathered:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than the requested number, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers.

Next, we calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + 7 \text{ (beakers)} = 31 \text{ items} \]

We know that Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of screws required for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start by identifying the number of eggs in each basket.

1. The first basket contains 10 eggs.
2. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total number of eggs:
\[
10 + 20 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[
\boxed{2180}

"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:
\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times \text{Time Aaron took} = A \times 16 \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute and he took 16 minutes, we have:
\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Given that Aaron's speed \( A \) is twice Vanessa's speed \( V \), we can express \( A \) as:
\[ A = 2V \]

Since Aaron ran \( D_A \) miles in 16 minutes, we can substitute \( A \) with \( 2V \):
\[ D_A = 2V \times 16 = 32V \]

Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so the distance Vanessa ran \( D_V \) is:
\[ D_V = 2 \times D_A = 2 \times 32V = 64V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so:
\[ D_V = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( D_V \):
\[ 64V = 4 \]
\[ V = \frac{4}{64} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Since Vanessa's speed is \( V = \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute, the time \( T_V \) it took her to run 4 miles is:
\[ T_V = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of line required based on the current length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- The current length of the dock is 200 feet.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed:
\[ \text{Total line needed} = 3 \times \text{Length of dock} = 3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we account for the line the caretaker already has:
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

To find out how much more line is needed, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:
\[ \text{Line to be bought} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Line already has} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of reservations per night:**
   Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.

2. **Determine the number of reservations per day:**
   Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

4. **Determine the cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   Multiply the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}

"First, we need to determine the total selling price of the 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25% on the cost price of $80.

To find the profit amount, we calculate 25% of $80:
\[
\text{Profit} = 0.25 \times 80 = 20
\]

Next, we add the profit to the original cost price to find the total selling price:
\[
\text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
\]

Now, we need to find the selling price per watermelon. Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons for $100, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[
\text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
\]

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's determine the current age of James. We know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, Dora's current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]
Since James is twice as old as Dora, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to determine John's current age. We know that John had a son James when he was 19, and James is currently 18. Therefore, John is currently:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his current age is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in one hour (60 minutes):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The installation takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the discounted radiator and the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \). We know from the problem that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ c + k = 20 \]

We also know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, and the total number of legs is 70. This gives us the second equation:

\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):

\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices each person can have if Henry and his 3 friends (which makes 4 people in total) share the pizzas equally. We divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
