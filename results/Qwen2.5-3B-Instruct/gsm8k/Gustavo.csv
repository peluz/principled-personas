"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and then multiply that by the price per egg.

First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has each day:
- The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs to make muffins.

The number of eggs remaining after breakfast and muffins is:
\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. Each egg sells for $2. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required for the robe. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Given that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts required:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after Josh's repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the increased value of the house is:

\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, Josh sells the house for its increased value of $200,000. He initially spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, totaling:

\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the selling price:

\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:

\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters he runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters he runs in one week for all sprints:**
   James runs 180 meters in one week for one sprint. Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi has a flock of 20 chickens and she feeds each chicken three cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock in a day is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed in the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass costs 60% of the price of a single glass.

First, let's determine the cost of a single glass and every second glass:
- The cost of a single glass is $5.
- The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:
- There are 8 pairs of glasses in 16 glasses.
- Each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.
- The cost for one pair is $5 + $3 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost for 8 pairs is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

So, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for 16 glasses."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep in each city and then sum them up.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep:**
   To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time taken for each part:
- Time for the first 40%: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update: 20 minutes

Total time = 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

The final numerical answer is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 0 mph × 2 hours = 0 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - Speed = 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance John has traveled:
- Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
315 miles"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{First month downloads} = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 70% of the downloads in the second month (since it reduced by 30%):
\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue - Annual cost
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to start earning money. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least equal to the initial cost of $90.

So, we set up the inequality:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take at least 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance, and then determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that this represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of hip-hop dance students} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the profit the merchant would make by choosing between the two purchase plans, we need to calculate the value of each item after the market increase and then find the difference between the two values.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[
\text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[
\text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we find the difference in value between the two options to determine the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Value of electronic gadgets} - \text{Value of jewelry} = 8096 - 5125 = 2971
\]

Therefore, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets over the jewelry is:

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Finally, we sum up her annual teaching and coaching earnings to get her total annual salary.

Let's do the math:

Annual teaching earnings = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Annual coaching earnings = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks and then convert that into dozens.

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire uses in one day:
- Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in one week:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, in one week, Claire uses \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \).

Now, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
- In 4 weeks, Claire uses \( 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \).

Finally, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
- There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
- So, \( 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7 dozens."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**
   - Time for first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time Marissa has:**
   - Total time = 3 hours
   - Time already spent = 2 hours
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance = 6 miles
   - Remaining time = 1 hour
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, we have 9 liters of orange drink left. The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

The total volume of the remaining mixture is:
\[ 9 + 15 - 1 = 23 \text{ liters} \]

To find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters, we use the proportion of water in the mixture:
\[ \text{Amount of water} = 23 \times \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{23} = 23 \times \frac{47}{69} = 23 \times \frac{47}{69} = \frac{1081}{69} = \frac{47}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{47}{3}} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Then we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered by dividing the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

First, we know the total distance of Henry's trip is 60 miles. His first stop was after he had traveled 20 miles. Therefore, the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance from the start to his second stop is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of friends to find the average:
\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. Therefore, the total time spent on one dog per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35 hours a week."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

jewels.

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

jewels.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 23 \]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, 25% more points is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]
Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 5 points.

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To solve this, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats over 30 days and then calculate the cost based on the sale price.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to get 60 yogurts, we divide 60 by 4:
\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money John has left after buying the video games. He started with $195 and spent $160.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

John has $5 left after his purchases, so the remaining money is:

\[
35 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

This confirms that the calculations are consistent. Since John sold all his lego sets and spent all the money on video games, he has no lego sets left.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs 3 days a week, with the first day being 3 hours and the other two days being half as much as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each.

So, the total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find his speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies into 8 pieces each, so there were 5 * 8 = 40 pieces of pie initially. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 26."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in one serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200 grams."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's find out how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).
3. After purchasing the package, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used \( x \) post-it notes from the package.
4. After placing the post-it notes on the coffee cups and using the initial 80 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163. 

\[
\boxed{163}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, and blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a day and then in a week.

Eggs produced per day: 252 eggs

Eggs produced per week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Now, let's convert the weekly egg production into dozens, since the price is given per dozen.

Eggs per dozen: 12 eggs

Dozens of eggs per week: 1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week

Finally, let's calculate how much Lloyd makes from selling the eggs at $2 per dozen.

Earnings per week: 147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM, which is a 3-hour trip in the opposite direction.

The formula for time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Since the distance is the same in both directions, we can use the speed of 6 mph for the return trip.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{6 \text{ mph}} \]

However, we don't have the exact distance, but we know that the distance is the same as the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM at 10 mph. Let's denote the distance as \(D\).

\[ D = 10 \text{ mph} \times \text{Time from 1 to 4 PM} \]

Since the time from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, using the distance \(D = 30 \text{ miles}\) and the speed of 6 mph for the return trip:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds.

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the days, we first need to calculate the revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

Now, we find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- Difference in revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

The final numerical answer is $40."
"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

First, we know that the adopted kittens are 7.

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens, the number of kittens from Patchy, and the number of kittens from Trixie:

\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, the number of bags she can fill is 28 / 2 = 14 bags. 

The final numerical answer is 14."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for one visit and then see how many such visits he can afford with his 42 dollars.

The cost for one visit includes:
- A movie ticket for $7
- Popcorn for $7

So, the total cost for one visit is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times he can go to the movies with 42 dollars. We do this by dividing the total amount of money he has by the cost of one visit:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his 42 dollars."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck, including the weight of the boxes, is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

First, we start with the original bill amount:
\[ \text{Original bill} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we add the 25% delivery fee to the original bill. To calculate the 25% fee:
\[ \text{25% of } \$40.00 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

Adding this fee to the original bill:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee} = \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00 \]

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ \text{Bill after delivery fee and delivery charge} = \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ \text{Final bill} = \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Now, we need to calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Insurance cost = 10% of $1300
Insurance cost = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Insurance cost
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to consider the two different rates of pension payment: the initial rate of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years, and the increased rate of 5% of the pension value after the 20th year.

1. **Calculate the pension value after 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.
   - The total pension value after 20 years is \(20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the pension value after the 20th year:**
   - Starting from the 21st year, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension after 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - The annual pension after the 20th year is \(1,000,000 \times 0.05 = 50,000\) dollars.

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the annual pension of $50,000 for the remaining 10 years.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be $50,000."

     140 \text{ dollars} \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \text{ dollars} \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]
   - There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     126 \text{ dollars/month} \times 6 \text{ months} = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Adding the costs for both halves of the year:
     \[
     840 \text{ dollars} + 756 \text{ dollars} = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how many gallons of gas are left in her tank after she has driven 100 miles. 

Given that she put in 4 gallons to refill her tank, and her tank holds 12 gallons, the amount of gas left in her tank after driving 100 miles is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we know that 4 gallons of gas allow her to drive 100 miles. Therefore, to find out how many miles she can drive on 8 gallons of gas, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{8 \text{ gallons}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \times 8}{4} = 200 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, Level 3 has \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: Level 2 has half the square footage of Level 3, so it has \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: Level 1 has half the square footage of Level 2, so it has \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level: 16, 8, 4, and 2.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum these values and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is 7.5."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days are left in the first year after the first 180 days. Since a year has 365 days:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to find the total amount of dog food needed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, and then find the difference between the two.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does as follows:
\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does as follows:
\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price and then compare it to the cost of buying the same number of flowers at the other price.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Vincent needs 18 flowers, and each package contains 2 flowers.
- Therefore, he needs \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) packages.
- Each package costs $1, so 9 packages cost \( 9 \times 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.
- The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.

Vincent saves \( 15 - 9 = 6 \) dollars by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

It's also given that they won 8 more games than they lost, so:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

"Gene is 34 years old now and he has been vacationing since he was 23. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Since he has one shirt from each vacation and each shirt is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks from his first vacation. For each subsequent vacation, he adds another quilt block. Since he goes on four vacations a year, the number of quilt blocks from each year forms a row in his quilt. Therefore, the number of quilt blocks in each row is equal to the number of vacations he has taken in that year. 

Since he has been vacationing for 11 years, he has 11 rows in his quilt, each containing 4 quilt blocks (one from each of his four vacations in that year). Thus, the total number of quilt blocks is 11 rows * 4 quilt blocks per row = 44 quilt blocks.

The final numerical answer is 44."
"Let's denote the number of rings the alarm made the first time it went off as \(R_1\), the second time as \(R_2\), and the third time as \(R_3\).

From the problem, we know:
- \(R_1 = 4\)
- \(R_2 = 3 \times R_1\)
- \(R_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times R_2\)

First, we calculate \(R_2\):
\[ R_2 = 3 \times R_1 = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate \(R_3\):
\[ R_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times R_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of rings:
\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 15."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Mary received 18 new potted plants from her nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. Therefore, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the 40 plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ 58 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 58 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can sum up all the doorbell rings:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\).

The final numerical answer is 175."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read in total, we first sum up the pages from all his textbooks:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has 4 days left to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:

Average pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
Average pages per day = 39 pages / 4 days
Average pages per day = 9.75 pages

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 9.75 pages per day."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks one glass of water with each meal:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner

He has three meals a day, so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day during weekdays.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of glasses of water he drinks during weekdays is:
\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks one glass of water with dinner, but instead of soda, he has a soda. So, he drinks 1 glass of water during the weekend.

There are 2 days in a weekend, so the total number of glasses of water he drinks during the weekend is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks during weekdays and weekends gives us the total for the week:
\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 17 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 17 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the total distance the fog bank needs to cover. The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Given that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate the total time required by dividing the total distance by the distance covered in 10 minutes and then multiplying by 10 minutes.

Here's the calculation:

1. Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments} \]

2. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, the total time required to cover the entire city is:
\[ 14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."

   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy places her pieces**: 
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom places her pieces**: 
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, then Cody eats \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is then:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 3 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 \text{ cubic inches} = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours:

1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours we've calculated is the number of hours he watched on Wednesday:

7 - 6 = 1 hour

Since he watched 1 hour on Wednesday, and each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), he watched:

1 / 0.5 = 2 episodes

So, Frankie watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more, we can verify the number of cookies he actually baked:
\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he has:
\[ 115 - 5 = 110 \]

This confirms that the number of cookies he intended to bake last year is indeed 50. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to calculate the total cost of the gas without the cashback, and then subtract the total cashback.

The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtracting the total cashback from the total cost of the gas gives:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The width of her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups.
- The length of her fruit roll-up is 24 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice has is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The width of his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups.
- The length of his fruit roll-up is 14 roll-ups.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell has is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups they both have together:
\[48 + 42 = 90\]

Since they both ate their entire amount, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
\[\frac{90}{2} = 45\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = \frac{64}{16} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} \text{ liters} = \frac{160}{10} \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"

"Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks as \( D \).

According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

The problem also states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 50D \]

Since we already know \( B = 300 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Here, \(x\) represents the number of teaspoons of sugar. Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary was $40000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his initial salary. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times 1.4 = 56000

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients.

First, let's calculate the revenue the hospital receives from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, each patient is seen for 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The hospital charges $200 per hour.
- So, the revenue from each patient is 0.4 * $200 = $80.

Next, let's calculate the cost the hospital incurs from each patient:
- Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, each patient is seen for 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
- The doctors charge $150 per hour.
- So, the cost from each patient is 0.4 * $150 = $60.

Now, we can calculate the profit from each patient:
- Revenue from each patient = $80.
- Cost from each patient = $60.
- Profit from each patient = $80 - $60 = $20.

Finally, we calculate the total profit from all patients:
- The hospital sees 500 patients a day.
- The profit from each patient is $20.
- Therefore, the total profit is 500 * $20 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles for Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Miles on Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can use this information to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. Let's denote the miles he walked on Wednesday as \( W \). The total mileage can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]
\[ 4 + 24 + W = 41 \]

Solving for \( W \):

\[ 28 + W = 41 \]
\[ W = 41 - 28 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we can multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. Therefore, the cost per month is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the year is:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$720 \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of Scottish unicorns} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. Therefore, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Thus, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies before the delivery fee and tip:

Cost of subs: 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
Cost of chips: 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
Cost of cookies: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00

Total cost before delivery fee and tip: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost before the delivery fee and tip:

Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost before the delivery fee and tip:

Total cost before tip: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, we add the tip:

Total cost including tip: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, Rory's delivery order will cost $29.00."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
- The first test had 75 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the first test is:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
- The second test had 100 questions.
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed on the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

The number of questions he left incomplete on the second test is:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ 35 \text{ questions} + 70 \text{ questions} = 105 \text{ questions} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, we have the relationship:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs:
\[ B = 12 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ 20\% \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan plays video games in one week.
2. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan would work in one week if he spent his video game time working.
3. Calculate the total earnings from working those hours.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he plays video games in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would work 14 hours in one week. He earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings for the week would be:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups.

The cost of nonfood items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of nonfood items before tax:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the tax on the nonfood items. The tax rate is 10%:
\[ \text{Tax} = 7 \times 0.10 = 0.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the tax to the cost of nonfood items:
\[ 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the total cost of food items and the total cost of nonfood items including tax:
\[ 8 + 7.70 = 15.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost including tax is:
\[ \boxed{15.70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach for one client is 2 * $2 = $4. The cost of one pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total cost for one client is $4 + $5 = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

So, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples harvested based on the number of harvests.

First, we know that John harvests his pineapples every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Next, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John harvests 1000 pineapples per harvest and he has 4 harvests in a year, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, so there were 0 bees. After 15 bees returned, there were 15 bees. After 60 bees left, there were 15 - 60 = -45 bees. Since the number of bees cannot be negative, this means all the bees that returned and some more left, resulting in a net loss of 45 bees. So, there were -45 bees, which means the hive is empty.

5. **Bee population at the end of the last 6 hours:** All the bees that left before this period return. Since there were -45 bees, all 45 bees that left before this period return, bringing the hive population back to 0 bees.

Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 45.

The final numerical answer is:
45"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the total amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:

"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Dorothy's number of friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. 

The final numerical answer is 4 minutes."

First, let's calculate the cost for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 people came with bicycles.
- Each tire costs 25 cents.
- Total cost for bicycle tires = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = $2.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles.
- Each tire costs 25 cents.
- Total cost for tricycle tires = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = $2.25.

Finally, let's calculate the cost for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle.
- Each tire costs 25 cents.
- Total cost for unicycle tire = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = $0.25.

"Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 - 9 = x - 20 \).
5. The raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 20) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon is \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) \).
6. The ants ate one final fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 20) = 6 \implies x - 20 = 18 \implies x = 38
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 38 \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the weekly hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours per week on these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both groups of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays + hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays
- Total weekly hours = 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Finally, we calculate the total hours for the entire semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- Total semester hours = total weekly hours \(\times\) number of weeks
- Total semester hours = 17 \(\times\) 16 = 272 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272 hours."
"First, let's convert all the lengths to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches for this problem.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is:
  \[
  300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is:
  \[
  120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is:
  \[
  2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ inches}
  \]
  Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is:
  \[
  60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}
  \]

Now, we add up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
\[
1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then compare the distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine the number of price increases that occur in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases is:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

The price of the bag of marbles after each increase can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the original price is the principal, the interest rate is 20% (or 0.20), and the number of periods is the number of increases.

The formula for the price after \( n \) increases is:
\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P_0 \) is the original price, \( r \) is the rate of increase, and \( n \) is the number of increases.

Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[ P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.42775639102064 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P \approx 20 \times 10.42775639102064 \]
\[ P \approx 208.5551278204128 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{208.56} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one red car. Given that one red car costs $4 and that a doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can find the cost of one action figure. If an action figure costs $5, then:

\[ 3 \text{ action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost of one action figure is $5.

Next, we can find the cost of the doll, which is equal to the cost of 3 action figures:

\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys:

- Red cars: 5 cars at $4 each = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
- Action figures: 3 figures at $5 each = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
- Doll: 1 doll at $15 = 15 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour for each hour she does not do freelance work. If we let \( h \) represent the number of hours she would have done freelance work, then the missed income from doing her taxes herself is \( 35h \).

The cost of hiring the accountant is a flat rate of $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the missed income to the cost of hiring the accountant. However, the problem does not specify the number of hours \( h \) she would have done freelance work. Without this information, we can only express the difference in terms of \( h \).

If Jackie hires the accountant, she will have \( 35h \) less income. If we assume she would have done \( h \) hours of freelance work, then the missed income is \( 35h \). The difference in income is:

\[ 35h - 90 \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( h \), we cannot calculate a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the expression of the difference in income, the answer would be:

\[ 35h - 90 \]

If we were to assume a specific value for \( h \), we could substitute it into the expression. For example, if \( h = 6 \) (meaning she would have done 6 hours of freelance work), then the missed income would be \( 35 \times 6 = 210 \) dollars, and the difference would be \( 210 - 90 = 120 \) dollars.

Since the problem does not specify \( h \), the final answer in the form of the expression is:

\[ \boxed{35h - 90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira's budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left = €1500 - €509 = €991

So, the final numerical answer is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required.

Each flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Thus, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to gather the required 45 eggs for making 15 flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

Given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age \( S \):
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance and the fact that he walks 10 miles on weekends.

- From Monday to Friday, he walks 20 miles each day. So, for 5 days, he walks \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.
- On Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for 2 days, he walks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Adding these together, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of each component of the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders with 8 legs each:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

2. **Insects with 6 legs each:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum up the total legs from all the groups:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, and then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Convert the time to peel one potato into seconds:
1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, add the time to peel and cut one potato:
90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to do this for 60 potatoes:
95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar for each gallon of lemonade and then determine how much they spent on lemons given their profit.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one gallon of lemonade:
- Cost of lemons: $3
- Cost of sugar: $2
- Total cost for one gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
- They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
- Each glass is sold for $0.50.
- Total revenue from one gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

Now, let's calculate the profit from one gallon:
- Profit per gallon = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

Given that their total profit is $25, we can determine how many gallons they sold:
- Total profit = Profit per gallon * Number of gallons
- $25 = $5 * Number of gallons
- Number of gallons = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

Finally, we calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:
- Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
- Total cost of lemons for 5 gallons = $3 * 5 = $15

So, the amount they spent on lemons is $15."

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4x \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5x = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( x \) using the equation \( 5x = 200 \):
\[
x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( x = 40 \), we can find the number of red roses:
\[
4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the winner and the margin of victory, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

For the first team, each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters. The second runner takes 3 seconds less, which is 57 seconds. The third runner takes 3 seconds less than the second runner, which is 54 seconds. The fourth runner takes 3 seconds less than the third runner, which is 51 seconds. The total time taken by the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two teams:

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability \(P(\text{number} > 3)\) is:

\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability \(P(\text{two even numbers in a row})\) is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the problem, we know:
- There are 3 cages of rats, each with \( r \) rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 6 \times 3r = 18r \).

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with 1 hamster, so the total number of hamsters is 10.
- Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \).

- There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is the sum of the pieces of straw given to the rats, the hamsters, and the rabbits. According to the problem, this total is 160 pieces of straw. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:

\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{106} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars.

The total cost for the trader is the sum of the buying cost and the transportation cost, which is \( 20n + 2n = 22n \) dollars.

The trader sells all the bags at a rate of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling the wheat is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the friends:

- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend will pay:
Each friend's share = Total cost / 3
Each friend's share = $102 / 3 = $34.

So, the final numerical answer is $34."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Tom has each year, taking into account the number of trees he plants and chops down, and the fact that 30% of the trees die after 10 years.

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50
2. **Trees planted per year**: 10
3. **Trees chopped down per year**: 2
4. **Net increase in trees per year**: 10 - 2 = 8
5. **Number of years**: 10

First, we calculate the number of trees after 10 years without considering the 30% death rate:

\[ \text{Number of trees after 10 years} = 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years. 30% of the trees die:

\[ \text{Number of trees that die} = 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:

\[ \text{Number of trees left} = 130 - 39 = 91 \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:

"To solve this, let's break down the events:

1. On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos were taken back, painted white, and put back out. One third of 18 is 6, so 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white. This means 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos remained on Sue's front yard.
3. On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning was 12 (remaining from Friday) + 18 (added on Sunday) = 30 pink flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, no white flamingos were added, so there were still 6 white flamingos from Saturday.

   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]
3. **Cards collected in the second month**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. **Cards collected in the third month**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the cards collected over the three months and add them to her initial number of cards:
\[
20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
\]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total payment from both publishers based on the number of sentences he edits and the rates paid by each publisher.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total payment Mark receives in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the total number of pails he gets in a day and then multiply that by the number of liters each pail contains.

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is:

\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Each pail contains 5 liters of water, so the total number of liters of water he gets every day is:

\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate the total salary increase for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- The total raise for the year is \( 100 \times 52 = 5200 \) dollars.

Now, we add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to the total raise:
- Total reward amount is \( 5000 + 5200 = 10200 \) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total salary for the year:
- John's weekly salary is $2000.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- The total salary for the year is \( 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \) dollars.

Adding the total reward to the total salary:
- Total amount made in the year is \( 104000 + 10200 = 114200 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
114200"

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches: \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets: \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

3. **Macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for the macaroni and cheese dish: \(8\).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[10 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 27\]

- Red pens: 12

Total number of pens:

\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98."
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93.
3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need to find the total sum of the six test scores that would give an average of 93. The formula for the average is:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we need to find the score required on the sixth test. Let's denote this score as \( x \). The sum of all six test scores should be 558:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]
\[ x = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First four weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in four weeks = 4 weeks * 5 rides/week * 25 km/ride.

**Next three weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers in three weeks = 3 weeks * 2 rides/week * 60 km/ride.

Let's calculate these:

For the first four weeks:
\[ 4 \times 5 \times 25 = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

For the next three weeks:
\[ 3 \times 2 \times 60 = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2600 \]"
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total after three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that on Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each cup. Let's break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of one plate is $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
     \[
     6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost of buying half a dozen plates:**
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.

3. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
     \[
     36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is:
     \[
     \frac{34800}{20} = 1740 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost of each cup:**
   - One dozen cups contains 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of each cup is:
     \[
     \frac{1740}{12} = 145 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:

\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Sara also earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn by \( x \). Her total earnings from mowing the lawn will be \( 4x \). Adding her initial savings of $10, her total money will be:

\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70, so we set up the inequality:

\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 4x \geq 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:

\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, we know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, we can calculate the number of white chickens and the total eggs collected:

\[ w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day. Since the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, and there were 100 customers on the first day, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]

2. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]

3. Simplify the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct setup:

Given:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B = 4S \]

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work, we first need to determine the total cost of her purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She pays $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 2040 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 2040 = 160 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, calculate their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Finally, calculate the average age of the three in three years:

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then use the total points to find Jojo's score.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's score is:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \( 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \( 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initial fire type: 30
- Initial grass type: 20
- Initial water type: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 new grass type cards:
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, the total number of cards is:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

The total number of cards is 30 + 34 + 32 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32. To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%."

Adding these together:
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Now, Chad adds an extra $3.00 for chips and a drink, so we add that to the total:
$11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Ready for harvest} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This means the number of watermelons remaining after the first harvest is:

\[ \text{Remaining} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. According to the problem, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Ready for harvest after two weeks} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after the two weeks, and the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \text{Not ready} = 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars:

\[ 20,000 \times 12 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the original cost of the cars:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we add the registration fees. Each car has a registration fee of $1,000, and Mark buys 12 cars:

\[ 1,000 \times 12 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the total cost of the cars including tax:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, Kylie collects 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

1. Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

2. Calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 36 = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

3. Now, subtract the number of penguins that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 12 = 12
   \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"To determine how many tomato vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he eats per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of tomatoes he eats in a week is:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes one vine can produce in a week. According to the problem, one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week by the number of tomatoes one vine can produce per week:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 tomato vines. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. John has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new ones. Ram starts with 25 pens and can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. This means that for every five empty pens, he can make one new pen.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. After this, he will have 20 pens left (25 - 5 = 20).
3. **Second Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 15 pens left (20 - 5 = 15).
4. **Third Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 10 pens left (15 - 5 = 10).
5. **Fourth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 5 pens left (10 - 5 = 5).
6. **Fifth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 0 pens left (5 - 5 = 0).

At this point, Ram has used all 25 pens to make new ones, and he has made 5 new pens in total. Therefore, the total number of pens he has is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made.

So, the total number of pens Ram has is:
\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, making his total $30. After investing this sum, it tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount of money he had after a year is:

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine the ages of each girl individually.

Given:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.

First, calculate Joan's age:
\[ \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, calculate Mary's age:
\[ \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[ \text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ \text{Students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

After students have left through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \text{Students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

After students have left through exit B, the remaining number of students is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280 \]

The rest of the students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[ \text{Students through exit C} = 280 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"Dolly has two books and reads them, so she reads 2 books. Additionally, Dolly reads Pandora's book, which is 1 book. Therefore, Dolly reads a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.

Pandora has one book and reads it, so she reads 1 book. Additionally, Pandora reads Dolly's books, which are 2 books. Therefore, Pandora reads a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.

In total, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 3 + 3 = 6 books.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike has left after stopping being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, so after stopping being pen pals with 2, he has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pages per week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ pages per week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages per week. He can write a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing per week is:

\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours per week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used this month and subtract that from his total plan allowance.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used for his daily calls with his boss. Since he makes a 15-minute call every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total number of minutes used for these calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he has used for other people this month:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of minutes used from the total plan allowance:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. At the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

Given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write the equation as:

\[ 32 - 4 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, we solve for \( F \):

\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium. 

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She requires 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours she works for the movie is:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Jean gets a 10% discount, so the discount amount is:

\[ 10\% \times \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean pays after the discount is:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \$27,000 \]"
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split the total cost evenly among her three parents, so we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. A pound of onions costs $1.50, so for 200 pounds, the cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this, let's first determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)

Sue's sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Each cookie has 200 calories, so the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister are:

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\)

Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\)

The difference in calories consumed is:

\(9200 - 3600 = 5600\)

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
   \[
   \text{Girls in third class} = 30 - 27 = 3
   \]

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   Each class has 20 students, and the total number of boys in the school is 30. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:

The number of boys in the third class is 17."
"To find out how many apps Travis has on his tablet now, we can follow these steps:

1. Travis started with 61 apps.
2. He deleted 9 apps, so we subtract 9 from 61: \(61 - 9 = 52\).
3. Then he downloaded 18 more apps, so we add 18 to 52: \(52 + 18 = 70\).

Therefore, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( w_1 \) be the number of wolves killed last night.
- Let \( c_1 \) be the number of cougars killed last night.
- Let \( w_2 \) be the number of wolves killed today.
- Let \( c_2 \) be the number of cougars killed today.

From the problem, we know:
- \( w_1 = 10 \)
- \( c_1 = 15 \)
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \( w_2 = 3c_2 \)
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night: \( c_2 = c_1 - 3 \)

Now, let's calculate \( c_2 \):
\[ c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate \( w_2 \):
\[ w_2 = 3c_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( w_1 = 10 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( w_2 = 36 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( c_1 = 15 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( c_2 = 12 \)

Total number of animals killed:
\[ \text{Total} = w_1 + w_2 + c_1 + c_2 = 10 + 36 + 15 + 12 = 73 \]

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply Anne's rides by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 240 cows are then divided equally into 20 stalls. Therefore, each stall will have:

\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ cows} \]

We are asked to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 12 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, the total cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee for having at least one book overdue, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ J_a + 8 = 52 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples. The problem also states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]

Substituting the value of \( J_a \):

\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

So, Jamal has 48 bananas. Now, we need to find out how many fruits Andrea has. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, and the same number of apples as Jamal. Therefore, Andrea has:

\[ \text{Apples Andrea has} = J_a = 44 \]
\[ \text{Bananas Andrea has} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 44 + 24 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 44 \text{ (Jamal's apples)} + 48 \text{ (Jamal's bananas)} + 44 \text{ (Andrea's apples)} + 24 \text{ (Andrea's bananas)} = 160 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cookies Carla is making. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \]

Next, we know that two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \times 66}{12} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the total pennies.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

"First, let's determine the number of trees each person has.

Chris has 6 trees.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so:
\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has individually.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000.

The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the selling price to find the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount paid for the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find out his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it then takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

40% of 20 minutes is \(0.4 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.

So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Finally, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the cooking time:

\(28 + 23 = 51\) minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is 51 minutes."

"To find the total number of windows in both houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Windows in bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in one house's bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is \(6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is 4.
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives us the total number of windows.
   - Total windows = windows in bedrooms + additional windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

1. **Stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Total stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Stitches for the body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

5. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the collar, rosette, and body of the sweater, we get the total stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 - 900 = 630
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   \[
   54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards remained after removing the ones with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D on them, are:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter D} = 9 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time for each type of hole separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:

"Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( C \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, so we have:

\[ M + C = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( C + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (C + 10) = M + C + 20 \]

Since we know that \( M + C = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + C + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote Ruby's current age as \( R \) and Sam's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of spots a mamba has.
2. Calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots.
5. Find half of the combined total number of spots.

Let's start with step 1. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:

\[ \text{Spots per mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, for step 2, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

For step 3, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. Since there are 60 mambas, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

For step 4, we find the combined total number of spots by adding the total spots for the cobras and the total spots for the mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, for step 5, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating pizza.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza serves 3 people.

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

So, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. The remaining length after accounting for the topaz gemstones is the length used by the sterling silver beads. This length is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of one bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Therefore, the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula for time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.

So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- There are 4 adults.

So, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Finally, we need to distribute these remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then convert that time into earnings based on her rate.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, we subtract that from the total time:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time into minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by $5:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial points for each player.
2. Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.
3. Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial points for each player.**

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

**Step 2: Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round.**

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

**Step 3: Sum the points after the extra points are distributed.**

- Mike's new points: \(21 + 1 = 22\)
- Jim's points remain: 18
- Tony's new points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

Now, we sum the points of all three players:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

The total points after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes. The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed by both sons is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will initially bought 15 oranges. After his sons wash 12 oranges, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on both days and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each activity Darren did on the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Next, we calculate the number of each activity he did on the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, we sum up the total number of each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we add up the totals for all activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the 5 members of the household.
2. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members, the total amount of rice consumed per meal is:
   \[
   0.2 \, \text{kg/meal/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal}
   \]

2. There are two meals per day (lunch and dinner), so the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
   \[
   1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

3. There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:
   \[
   2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}
   \]

4. Finally, to find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target.

First, let's list the days he sold bread and the number of crates sold each day:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he did not sell any bread on those days. Therefore, the total number of crates sold in the week is 65.

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-55} \]"
"To determine how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

Let's denote the initial bid as $200. The bids increase by $50 each time, and Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people. Therefore, the bids made by the other people are $200, $250, and $300. Carmen's bids will be $350, $400, and $450, since she bids after each of the other people.

Now, let's sum up all the bids:
- The first person's bid: $200
- The second person's bid: $250
- The third person's bid: $300
- Carmen's first bid: $350
- Carmen's second bid: $400
- Carmen's third bid: $450

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 450 \]

We can group and add them step by step:
\[ (200 + 450) + (250 + 400) + (300 + 350) = 650 + 650 + 650 = 1950 \]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen paid for the desk is:
\[ \boxed{1950} \]"
"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost per mile driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year. John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven in a year is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. The cost is $2 per mile, so:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30000 \text{ per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver in a year. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1800 \text{ per year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
\[ \$30000 + \$1800 = \$31800 \]

So, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:
\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each side. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can be used to print 2 pages.
2. Therefore, for 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) pieces of paper.

So, the number of pieces of paper needed is 16."
"First, let's calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks. She spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. After spending $25, she has:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

dollars left. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this amount from the remaining $25, we get:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[ 15 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books: 250
- Unsold books: 50
- Books sold: 250 - 50 = 200
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books sold in the first year: 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
65 books * $20/book = $1300

The final numerical answer is $1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's earnings from his hourly wage. He works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since April has 30 days, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April has 4 full weeks and 2 extra days. Therefore, Watson works for 4 full weeks and 2 days in April.

For the 4 full weeks, his earnings are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$500/\text{week} = \$2000 \]

For the 2 extra days, he works 2 days, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{5}\) of a week. His earnings for these 2 days are:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \text{ weeks} \times \$500/\text{week} = \$200 \]

So, his total earnings from his hourly wage for the month of April are:
\[ \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200 \]

Additionally, since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week for 4 weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$300/\text{week} = \$1200 \]

Adding his earnings from his hourly wage and the bonus, we get:
\[ \$2200 + \$1200 = \$3400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:
\[ \boxed{3400} \]"
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we can calculate the number of people he beats as follows:

\[ \text{Number of people John beats} = 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestles 20 people in total, the number of people he loses to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beats:

\[ \text{Number of people John loses to} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Since two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, we have:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, we find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:

\[
\text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined is:

\[
\text{Afternoon and evening sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight Sandy needs to lose in 4 weeks is 2 pounds. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we can use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 1 \text{ week} \]

So, it will take Sandy 1 week to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
- Savings on two tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is $M.
- Discounted price of one packet of milk: $M - $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $M - ($M - $0.5) = $0.5
- Savings on four packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

The final numerical answer is:
$6"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 3, which is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 5, which is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = number of extra arms + number of extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

The total amount Theo wishes to spend on the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend is:
Total amount - Amount to save = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, to find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners, we subtract the total costs from the amount he can spend:
Amount to spend on gifts = Total amount to spend - Total costs = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

So, the final numerical answer is $2050."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the daily consumption and then extend it to a week.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \times 7 = 91 \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age. We know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

So, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Set up the equation for the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Solving for \(P\), we get \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Also, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2, so we rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8. 

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 / 4 = 2\).

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store's existing marbles.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his marbles is:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles given by his father is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) to fill the pool is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \), the number of girls as \( G \), and the number of nongendered children as \( N \).

Given:
- \( B = 30 \)
- The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys: \( G = 3B \)
- The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys: \( N = \frac{1}{10}B \)

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[ G = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, add up all the children in the classroom:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and knowing that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the proportion:
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]

Thus:
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women left at the party after some people left.

First, let's calculate the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
- Men: 25
- Women: 15
- Total: 25 + 15 = 40 people

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left:
- Number of people who left: 40 * 1/4 = 10 people

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since 10 people in total left, the number of women who left is:
- Number of women who left: 10 - 22 = -12

Since the number of women who left cannot be negative, it means that all the women who left were among the 10 people who left, and there were no women who stayed. Therefore, the number of women who left is 10, and the number of women who stayed is:
- Number of women who stayed: 15 - 10 = 5

So, the number of women left at the party is 5."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in boxes. We know that Jam has 2 loose pencils and a total of 26 pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam has. Since the problem does not specify the number of pencils per box, we assume that each box contains the same number of pencils. However, the number of boxes Jam has is not directly asked, but rather the total number of boxes needed to store all their pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils, we need to consider the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

If we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils, we need to find the minimum number of boxes required to store 72 pencils. The number of boxes needed is the total number of pencils divided by the number of pencils per box. Since the number of pencils per box is not specified, we can only determine the total number of boxes needed if we assume the smallest possible number of pencils per box, which is 1 (i.e., each box holds 1 pencil).

Therefore, the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils is:

\[ 72 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 72 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of the cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not weaken the coffee, so it does not affect the milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is solely due to the cooling.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded comes from 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:
\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time required to charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total percentage increase needed to reach 100% from 60%:

\(100\% - 60\% = 40\%\)

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:

\(40 \times 3 = 120\) minutes to charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\(120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the $8 rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards.
   - Since the rewards used were $8, the coupon takes off $8 * 2 = $16.
   - After applying the $16 coupon, the cost becomes $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

"Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as \( x \). The number of students in the smallest group would then be \( x - 10 \). According to the problem, the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"Let's start by determining the weights of the other animals based on the information given:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, the yellow snake, the red bird, and the container:

\[
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after taking the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days) in June.

First, let's find out how much more Tyson should run each day. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than he currently runs. Since Tyson currently runs 5000 meters, the additional distance is:

\[ \text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson should run each day is:

\[ \text{Total distance per day} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance Tyson runs in June is:

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money the factory makes per day now compared to when they made tractors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from silos.
3. Find the difference in earnings.
4. Calculate the percentage increase.

First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Therefore, the daily earnings from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

Now, we find the difference in earnings:
- The difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

Finally, we calculate the percentage increase:
- The percentage increase = (Difference / Original Amount) * 100 = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The percentage more they are making per day now is 10%."
"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is given as $20.

The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine

\[ 400 \text{ cents per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2000 \text{ cents} \]

To convert the final amount from cents to dollars:
\[ 2000 \text{ cents} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2).

So, the total amount spent on gumballs is $2. This means the amount spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is $8 / $1.5 = 5.3333 pounds.

To find out how much change he has after buying the candy, we subtract the cost of the candy from the initial amount: $10 - $8 = $2.

He takes half of this change and spends it on gumballs, which is $2 / 2 = $1. Since each gumball costs $0.05, he can buy $1 / $0.05 = 20 gumballs, but the problem states he bought 40 gumballs, which means the calculation for the change and gumballs is consistent with the given information.

Therefore, the number of pounds of candy he bought is 5.3333 pounds, which we can round to 5.33 pounds if we need a more precise answer.

The final numerical answer is:
5.33"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \). According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance at which the train needs service, which is 18,000 miles.

So, the number of days between services is:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Since the question asks for the number of days, and 0.0375 days is a fraction of a day, we can leave the answer as it is, or convert it to a more understandable format. However, the question seems to be asking for the number of days, so the final numerical answer is:

0.0375"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for each type of dog bed and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

First, let's find the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing needed for a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know the stuffing requirements:
- A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"First, let's calculate the time it took John to drive to his friend's house. The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ \text{Total detour distance} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The speed during the detour is 70 mph, so the time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Detour distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time for detour} + \text{Time to home} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 and 3 to fractions with denominator 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So the total trip time is:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"First, let's find out how many fourth-grade boys there are at Small Tree School. Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boys were present on Friday. On Friday, 4 boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present is:

\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School who were present on Friday is 49. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 49 \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on her third test. The equation for the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is \( 4x - 5 \). Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers for shoplifting. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to first establish the current point totals and then work backwards.

1. Sara's current points: 8
2. Erin's current points: 14
3. Erin now has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin's current points are three times Sara's current points.

Let's verify this:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's current points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This confirms that Erin currently has 24 points, which is indeed three times Sara's 8 points.

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring} = \text{Erin's current points} - \text{points scored} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. To find the savings, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ \text{Savings} = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

Subtracting the savings from the original cost gives us the total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. 

The final numerical answer is:

1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is 5 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment after the faulty ones were returned.

First, let's calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, we can find the number of faulty pieces by calculating 40% of the total number of pieces. Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as \( N \). The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces of equipment is then \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000, and this cost is distributed among all the pieces of equipment. Therefore, the cost per piece of equipment is \( \frac{400000}{N} \).

The total cost of the functioning pieces of equipment is the cost per piece multiplied by the number of functioning pieces, which is \( 0.6N \times \frac{400000}{N} = 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \).

Thus, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep. So, she gets 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep. From the other half of her sheep, which is also 15 sheep, she gets 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk she collects every day is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

The final numerical answer is 45."

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months and then add that to the principal amount to get the total amount she will pay back. Finally, we divide this total by the number of months.

The formula for calculating the total amount to be paid back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Interest Rate = 10% or 0.10
- Time = 5 months

First, we calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

Then, we add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find out how much she has to pay per month:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 per month."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, so the profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours the lemonade stand is open to sell all 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the total land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The remaining land is given as 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is 26. On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of female members who can't make it is:

\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

This means that the number of female members who can make it to the performance is:

\[
26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets, we need to calculate the cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for David who buys a ride bracelet:
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.
- Therefore, David spends $30 for 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha who buys individual tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs $4.
- For 9 rides, Dasha would need 9 rides * $4 per ride = $36.

Now, we compare the total costs:
- David spends $30.
- Dasha spends $36.

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of individual tickets is:
\[ 36 - 30 = 6 \]

So, David saves $6."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. The total parts of the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
- Betty's popsicles: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
- Sam's popsicles: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the streaming services Tim will get:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% by bundling them. So, the savings per month for Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $10, which is $2. Therefore, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount is $10 - $2 = $8 each.

So, the total monthly cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $8 + $8 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix and Hulu/Disney Plus together to find the total monthly cost for the streaming services:

- Netflix: $10
- Hulu/Disney Plus: $16

Total monthly cost for streaming services: $10 + $16 = $26.

Tim's cable package costs $60 a month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable package and switching to the streaming services is:

$60 - $26 = $34.

The final numerical answer is $34."
"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. We'll use minutes for this calculation.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
- Time spent recording: half of the time spent writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Time spent editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = 240 (writing) + 120 (recording) + 90 (editing) = 450 minutes

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, which means it can hold a total of \(6 \times 6 = 36\) books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. Let's denote the number of books the shelving system can hold as \(N\). Here, \(N = 36\).

First, we calculate double the number of books the shelving system can hold:
\[2 \times N = 2 \times 36 = 72\]

Next, we add 20 to this value to find out how many books Wendy wants to place:
\[72 + 20 = 92\]

Therefore, the number of books Wendy will need to carry to complete her task is:
\[
\boxed{92}

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.
- Adding these together, Erica has \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She gave 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has left, we subtract the cards she passed out and received from the total number of cards she has:

\[ 50 - 24 - 5 + 17 = 42 \]

So, Erica now has 42 Valentine's cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, Jenny gives away a total of:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since the pizza originally had 12 slices, the number of slices left is:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we first need to calculate the difference between the cost of the bike and the money he currently has.

The cost of the bike is $300.
Mark currently has $50.

The amount of money Mark still needs is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to work to earn $250, we divide the amount he needs by his daily earnings:
\[ \frac{250}{10} = 25 \]

Therefore, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes. Nancy saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. Since she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ 168 \]"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth based on the information given.

2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is:
   \[
   35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
   \[

"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are required.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
- \( 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \)

Thus, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under two different scenarios: the original usage and the reduced usage. Then, we can find the difference in energy consumption over 30 days.

First, let's calculate the energy consumption of the air conditioner under the original usage:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
- It is used for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
  \[
  900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours/day}
  \]
- To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
  \[
  7200 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the energy consumption under the reduced usage:
- The air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).
- Therefore, the daily energy consumption is:
  \[
  900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours/day}
  \]
- Converting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:
  \[
  2700 \text{ watt-hours/day} \div 1000 = 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day}
  \]

Now, we calculate the energy saved per day:
\[
7.2 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} - 2.7 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} = 4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day}
\]

Finally, we find the total energy saved over 30 days:
\[
4.5 \text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kilowatt-hours}
\]

Thus, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[
\boxed{135}

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras, so we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average:
\[88 / 3 = 29.3333\ldots\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[29.3333\ldots\]"
"To solve this, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:

\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
\]
\[
5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[
5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00
\]
\[
5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[
\$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Since there are 40 cannolis:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he had 100 cannolis after buying more:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   Now we add the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is the difference between his goal and the steps he had left after the jog, which is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps. Since he had already taken 6,000 steps before the jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

The final numerical answer is 2,000."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ \text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we calculate how long it will take Toby to read the entire book:

\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to start reading 50 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

\[ \text{Time to start reading} = 60 - 10 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby starts reading 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he will be:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ minutes early} \]

   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets, so the cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add the cost of the taffy and the cost of the seashells and magnets to find the total amount spent:
$4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
$10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( c + d = 180 \)
2. The total number of humps: \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):

\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse they'd seen. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the pricing changes.

First, we calculate the cost for the first 6 months:
- The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost for the next 2 months is $12 per month.
- Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

Then, we calculate the cost for the remaining 8 months (months 9 to 16):
- The cost for the remaining 8 months is $14 per month.
- Total cost for the remaining 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

Finally, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 + $24 + $112 = $184.

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $184."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine the amount saved from each type of jeans. Let's denote the amount saved from the jogger jeans as \( S_j \) and the amount saved from the tattered jeans as \( S_t \). We know:

\[ S_j + S_t = 6 \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - S_j = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

Since the savings from the tattered jeans cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the distribution. The correct distribution should be:

\[ S_j = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

This indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the savings distribution:

\[ S_j = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct interpretation should be:

\[ S_j = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct distribution is:

\[ S_j = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, her bird feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day.

Since she has 6 bird feeders, the total number of birds she can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 * 30 = 180 birds. 

The final numerical answer is 180."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. To find 25% of $4, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel. Therefore, the soup costs:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we know the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we can find the total cost of the dinner by adding the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, which gives him \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.

He uses this $x to buy the ticket and has $50 left, which means the ticket costs \( x - 50 \) dollars.

Since the ticket costs $100, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 50 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of hotdogs prepared by the caterer. Initially, the caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them eating two hotdogs each. This means:

\[ \text{Number of guests eating two hotdogs} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So, the caterer prepared:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer needs to provide:

\[ 40 \text{ hotdogs} \]

Since the caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' sister's name. We know that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters, so the total is:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:

Discount amount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Final cost = $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]

2. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
     \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5. To find out how much he spent, we calculate 99% of $5:

\[ 0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \]

So, George spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars. We know the cost of a bag of chips is 40 cents, which is $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 3 bags of chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

This means the total cost of the chips and candy bars is $4.95, and the cost of the chips is $1.20. So, the cost of the candy bars is:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the total cost of the candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends. When these 20 lollipops are shared equally among four friends, each friend receives 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops. 

The final numerical answer is 5."
"Rory and her mom each have a piece, which means they have 2 pieces in total. The cake weighs 20 ounces, and Rory and her mom have 2 pieces, so the remaining cake weighs:

"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends, which makes a total of 8 people.

So, each person will get:

\[
\frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Everyone will get 7 oranges. 

\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, it takes Wayne four minutes to drive to the theater.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater is:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before the time Wayne leaves. If Wayne leaves at the start of the 4-minute drive, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before that, which is:
\[ 4 - 5 = -1 \text{ minute} \]

Since leaving 1 minute before Wayne's departure time would mean Bernadette leaves 1 minute before the start of Wayne's 4-minute drive, and she needs to be 5 minutes early, she should leave 1 minute before Wayne's departure time, which means she should leave 1 minute before the start of Wayne's 4-minute drive. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne leaves, which means she should leave 1 minute before the start of Wayne's 4-minute drive, making her 5 minutes early overall.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 1 minute before Wayne to get to the theater first. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's bedroom is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the final temperature of the house, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after the window is closed = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let the time for the run for James be \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

- She also has 2 loose eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass needs 5 eggs:

- The number of glasses that can be made is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Finally, since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we can calculate the number of trays that can be filled:

- The number of trays that can be filled is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores an additional 26 points.
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]
So, Joey's new score is 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores an additional 10 points.
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]
So, Marcy's new score is 235 points.

Now, we find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]
So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

These 31 sneakers were sold to the department store for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling all the sneakers:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from the two types of packets separately and then sum them up.

For the six packets with eight pieces each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 pieces of crayons."
"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. We can write this as:

\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 21 = 13 + P \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the original cost per balloon and then calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase. Finally, we will use the new cost per balloon to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons.

1. **Determine the original cost per balloon:**
   - Total cost for 20 balloons = $900
   - Original cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
   - Original cost per balloon = $900 / 20 = $45

2. **Calculate the new cost per balloon:**
   - New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + $20
   - New cost per balloon = $45 + $20 = $65

3. **Calculate the cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - Cost for 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
   - Cost for 170 balloons = $65 * 170 = $11050

The final numerical answer is $11050."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

For the first part of the trip:
- Speed = 60 mph
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed * Time = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second part of the trip:
- Speed = 30 mph
- Time = 1 hour
- Distance = Speed * Time = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3 of them, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of the rubies she received in the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \]

Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the value of the 2 rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then add those amounts together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for his raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for 160 bags is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards. 

To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to the original 15:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. After these 25 fairies joined the original 50, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75. Then, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies. 

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feeds to find the total weight of the feed:
\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Since 2250 pounds is exactly half of 4500 pounds, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts).

We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (allergic to both)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is given by:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| \]

"To determine how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to save is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child saves $2 daily. To find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we first need to calculate the total capacity of the trays and then subtract the number of eggs Jaime has.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. Therefore, the total capacity of the trays is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs that won't be placed on the tray is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, which costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the cost is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Applying the ""buy one get one free"" offer:**
   - With the offer, for every pack Heather buys, she gets another pack for free.
   - Since she buys 2 packs, she gets 2 packs for free.
   - Therefore, she only pays for 2 packs, which is still $8.00.

3. **Applying the $2.00 coupon:**
   - The total cost after applying the coupon is \(8.00 - 2.00 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Calculating the cost per razor:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs, and each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.
   - Cost per razor = \(\frac{6.00}{8} = 0.75\) dollars.

5. **Converting the cost per razor to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per razor in cents is \(0.75 \times 100 = 75\) cents.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 75 cents."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. 

The human pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on top of the 4, and 2 girls on top of the 3. The shortest girl is at the top, so she is the 10th girl, which is 60"" tall.

Let's calculate the total height:

- The 4 girls on the bottom are each 64"" tall, so their total height is \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches.
- The 3 girls on top of the 4 are each 64"" tall, so their total height is \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches.
- The 2 girls on top of the 3 are each 64"" tall, so their total height is \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches.
- The shortest girl at the top is 60"" tall.

Adding these together gives the total height of the human pyramid in inches:

\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches.

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she works. Since she works for 8 hours each day, the total minutes she walks each day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total minutes she walks is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the current ages of Brett and Angela.

Brett is currently 14 years old.

In four years, Brett's age will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Angela's current age:
\[ \text{Angela's age in 4 years} = 3 \times 14 \]

Let's calculate the right side of the equation:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 years from 42:
\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car, we need to consider the cost of his morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Over 14 days, the number of morning rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for morning rides is \(28 \times 6 = 168\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Over 14 days, the number of afternoon rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\).
- The total cost for afternoon rides is \(28 \times 2 = 56\).

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = $168 + $56 = $224

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $224."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the total number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie requires three oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests by \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 25n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 25:
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16."
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."

- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Next, Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise.

Adding the gifts for her friends and the additional gifts:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug's width is:

\[ \text{Rug's width} = \text{Chair's width} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Twice the rug's width} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Couch's length} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). We know that Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2. Let's denote the cost of the green apple gum as \( G \). According to the problem, she paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, so \( G = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total amount Suzie spent is $7. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget, considering the cost and quantity of each type of wood.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
- Cost of 1 2 x 4 = $4
- Number of 2 x 4 he can buy = $24 / $4 = 6 pieces

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
- Cost of 1 2 x 8 = $6
- Number of 2 x 8 he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces

Now, let's calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can make with each type of wood:
- From 6 pieces of 2 x 4: 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 sticks
- From 4 pieces of 2 x 8: 4 pieces * 400 sticks/piece = 1600 sticks

Since Frederick can buy more sticks from 2 x 8 pieces of wood, the most popsicle sticks he can make is from the 2 x 8 pieces.

The final numerical answer is:
1600"
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of legs Mario's dogs have. Since each dog has four legs and he has six dogs, the total number of legs (and thus the total number of snowshoes needed) is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Since each dog needs one pair of snowshoes, Mario will need 6 pairs of snowshoes. The total cost is then:

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so her total weekly cost without the bus pass is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

With the weekly bus pass costing $20, the savings per week is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and 15 sheep (since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep, but the problem states the farm has 15 sheep, which is consistent with the farm having half as many sheep as the zoo, which has 20 sheep).

The zoo has 20 cows and 20 sheep (since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, so the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows, but the problem states the zoo has 20 cows, which is consistent with the zoo having twice as many cows as the farm, which has 30 cows, and 20 sheep).

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and sheep from both the farm and the zoo:

Farm: 30 cows + 15 sheep = 45 animals
Zoo: 20 cows + 20 sheep = 40 animals

Combined: 45 animals (farm) + 40 animals (zoo) = 85 animals

The final numerical answer is 85."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following equations based on the relationship:

Let \( S_o \) be the number of onions Sophia bought, and \( S_p \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. We can break this down into months:

- December: 31 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 19 days

Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 221 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{221 \text{ days}} \approx 475.64 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 476 calories each day to reach his goal. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 476 \]"

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. 

The total amount of money from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The total amount of money from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:

Now, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, the number of batches Heather can make is:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device.

First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour.

Next, let's calculate her daily consumption after adding the new device:
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts per week.
- Weekly consumption after adding the new device: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts per week.

Next, let's calculate the cost of electricity for each scenario:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50.
- Cost before adding the new device: 84 kilowatts per week * $1.50 = $126.
- Cost after adding the new device: 98 kilowatts per week * $1.50 = $147.

Finally, let's find the difference between the two costs:
- Difference in weekly electric bill: $147 - $126 = $21.

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. Determine how much one person can paint in one day.
2. Calculate how much 5 people can paint in one day.
3. Determine how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.
4. Convert the number of days into hours.

First, if one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is a quarter of a house. So, one person paints \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a house in one day.

Next, if 5 people are working together, they can paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \) of a house in one day. This means that 5 people can paint \( \frac{5}{4} \) of a house in one day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to divide the whole house (which is 1) by the amount they can paint in one day (\( \frac{5}{4} \)):

\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ days} \]

Now, to convert the number of days into hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

\[ \text{Number of hours} = \frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which means \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has \( S_O + C_O = 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has \( S_J + C_J = 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these together, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 42 + 130 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{172}
\]"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could have bought with that amount of money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

With $4, Tom could have bought:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, the number of additional CDs Tom would have been able to buy is:

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the hours he worked out each week. We know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. For the remaining 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week and 6 hours in one of those weeks.

Let's calculate the total hours step by step:

1. For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off (which is 8) get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. On the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off (which is 21). So, the number of people who get on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 in 8 years, which means:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

So, Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is 22 years old now, and his cousin is 47 years old now. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of the two now is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- \( C = 1100 \)
- \( P = C - 400 \)
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells brought by each girl. Let's break down the information given:

- There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- The number of boys is equal to the number of girls, so there are 10 boys and 10 girls.
- Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
- Each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

First, calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:
\[ \text{Total seashells by boys} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Next, calculate the number of seashells each girl brought:
\[ \text{Seashells by each girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 300 \]"

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, Anne's age is:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, each boy starts with $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share.
   - His new share is \( 6 + 5 = 11 \) dollars.
   - The following day, he adds another $10.
   - His new share is \( 11 + 10 = 21 \) dollars.

3. **Spending:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total.
   - His remaining amount is \( 21 - 8 = 13 \) dollars.

4. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8.
   - His new amount is \( 13 \times 3 = 39 \) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, let's denote the number of days in April as 30. The second half of the month would then be 15 days (since 30/2 = 15).

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves in the second half of the month would be \( 2x \).

The total amount saved in April would be the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{3} = 375 \]

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. Since the amount he saves in the second half is twice the amount he saves in the first half, he saves:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 375 = 750 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $750 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $7.00."

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's determine the volume of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, and Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem asks for the reduction in terms of the daily recommended cups, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5R - 4}
\]"
"To find the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters to the number of guinea pigs.

There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is:
\[ 45 \]"
"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can calculate the average weight of the three friends:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

Initially, the angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house every hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle (32 degrees) plus the angle the sun has moved (50 degrees):

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 82 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine the ages of James' sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means he is 8 years old.

So, the total number of candles needed is 12 (for the older son) + 8 (for the younger son) = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night, she read for 7 nights. Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total reading time in the first week from minutes to pages. Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in the first week is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches. 

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten by both is \( 4 + 3 = 7 \). 

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is 5."
"To solve this, let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 10 \]

So, his nephew is 10 years old today.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy for each tooth she lost.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left $1.00 each.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy left half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each.

Let's calculate the total amount step by step:

- For the first tooth: $5.00
- For the next three teeth: $1.00 each, so $1.00 * 3 = $3.00
- For the last two teeth: $0.50 each, so $0.50 * 2 = $1.00

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]"
"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

First, we know that Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, we know that Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna as follows:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by adding the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's earnings.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, Mitchell's total earnings can be calculated as follows:
\[
21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[
84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Peter spends each day and then determine how many action figures he buys over the week.

First, let's calculate the total amount Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), we can divide his total money by 4:

\[ \text{Daily spending on wooden action figures} = \frac{70}{4} = 17.5 \]

Since the cost of each wooden action figure is $5, we can determine how many wooden action figures he buys:

\[ \text{Number of wooden action figures} = \frac{17.5}{5} = 3.5 \]

Since Peter can't buy half an action figure, we assume he buys 3 wooden action figures (as the problem implies he buys whole figures).

Next, we calculate the remaining money after buying the wooden action figures:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 70 - (3 \times 5) = 70 - 15 = 55 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. There are 4 days in this period, so we can calculate the number of plastic action figures he can buy:

\[ \text{Number of plastic action figures} = \frac{55}{2} = 27.5 \]

Again, since Peter can't buy half an action figure, we assume he buys 27 plastic action figures.

Now, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week:

\[ \text{Total number of action figures} = 3 + 27 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to add up all the expenses:

1. Cost of spaying the kitten: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of repairing 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 + $60 + $48 = $308

So, the total cost for Leah so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- 20 roses to the first shop
- 15 roses to the second shop
- 30 roses to the third shop

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from her account over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months. If she removes $100 each month, the total amount removed over 24 months is \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount:
\[3000 - 2400 = 600\]

So, the amount of money remaining in her account after 2 years is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[600\]"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 sandwiches:

- Cost of bread: $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, for 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread, which costs $3.00.
- Cost of cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:

- They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
- For 10 sandwiches, the total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

Now, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, the net profit is $37.00."
"First, we need to determine the total number of crayon pieces Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so the total number of crayon pieces is:

Next, we need to find out how many groups of 8 crayon pieces she can melt together to make one muffin. This is calculated by dividing the total number of crayon pieces by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \]

So, Kate can make 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = \$2592 + \$432 = \$3024 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is \$11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we need to first calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that total by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown of the number of birds seen each day:
- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we sum the total number of birds seen:
\[ 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
\[ \frac{330}{7} = 47.14285714285714 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is:
\[ 47.14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 47.14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. Let's denote this value as \( S \). So, \( S = 20 \).

2. **First Operation**: The first operation is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: The result of the first operation is then divided by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: The result of the second operation is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage by which the oven is off when set to 450 degrees. We can then use this percentage to determine the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

So, the oven is off by 4% when set to 450 degrees. We need to find the temperature setting \( T \) such that the actual temperature is 520 degrees. We can set up the equation based on the percentage error:

\[
\left( \frac{520 - T}{T} \right) \times 100 = 4
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
\frac{520 - T}{T} = 0.04
\]

\[
520 - T = 0.04T
\]

\[
520 = 1.04T
\]

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{500}

"To find out the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the duration of each movie together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies:
90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

So, the total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's price. Herb's house is valued at $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's price gives the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups, which is 20 more than what Judy bought. This confirms the number of cups Judy bought (40 - 20 = 20, but this is not relevant to the calculation).

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy bought, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes she brought is \(12 + 24 = 36\).

Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total number of cups and dishes her friend brought is \(40 + 44 = 84\).

The total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is \(36 + 84 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount:

Original price of one box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00

Discounted price of one box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be:

Total cost for 2 boxes = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

Total contacts = 2 * 90 = 180 contacts

Since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the total number of pairs of contacts is:

Total pairs = 180 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 90 pairs

Finally, the cost per pair of contacts is:

Cost per pair = Total cost for 2 boxes / Total pairs = $180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair

The final numerical answer is $2.00."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how many ml of water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{ml}}{1600 \, \text{calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \, \text{ml} \times 1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \, \text{ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]
\[ x = 800 \, \text{ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).

The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we first need to determine the three measurements. The initial speed is 47 WPM, the speed after the first increase is 52 WPM, and the speed after the second increase is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57. To find the average, we sum these values and then divide by 3.

The sum of the measurements is:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

The average is:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52. Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer:

"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we will calculate the number of attendees step by step.

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   Alex initially invites 100 people.

2. **Friends Invited by Initial Invited:**
   Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 friends. Therefore, the number of friends invited by the initial 100 people is:
   \[
   100 \times 2 = 200
   \]

3. **Additional Invitations:**
   Alex calls 10 of her friends to invite them. Out of these 10 friends, 8 say they will be bringing their spouses. Therefore, the number of additional attendees from these 10 friends is:
   \[
   8
   \]

4. **Total Attendees:**
   Adding all the attendees together:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial invited)} + 200 \text{ (friends invited by initial invited)} + 8 \text{ (additional from friends)} = 308
   \]

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{308}\) seats."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs \(2 \times 10 = 20\) pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\) pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs \(44 \times 5 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake:
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

The base cost for 2 implants is:
\[ 2 \times \$2000 = \$4000 \]

For one of the implants, the porcelain crown adds an extra $500:
\[ \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 260 \]"
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make in 12 hours. Since Ruiz works at a rate of 60 pounds per hour, in 12 hours he will make:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Similarly, since Marissa works at a rate of 45 pounds per hour, in 12 hours she will make:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the totals together, the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ \text{Total chocolate} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract that from his initial amount of $100.

On Monday, Howard spends $8.
On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Subtracting the total amount spent from his initial amount of $100 gives:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times \$0.50 = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times \$0.60 = \$12 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can find the total rotations per month as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations each tire can handle by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Months per tire} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many years the tires can last by dividing the number of months by 12:

\[ \text{Years per tire} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Since the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps, we can calculate the total number of washes per pump:

\[ \text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how much one pump costs. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, and since there are 2 pumps in the bottle, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12.00 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost of each pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt's original price is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts' original price is $35, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months are already accounted for, so the extended period is 50 - 5 = 45 months.
   - The funding for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.
   - Therefore, the funding per month for the extended period is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.
   - Total cost for the extended 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Summing the initial and extended funding: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000."

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Consumption During School Hours**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school hours (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).

3. **Gum Consumption on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Consumption After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving some to his sister.

   - After chewing 4 pieces during school, 1 piece on the way home, and 1 piece after dinner, Jim has chewed a total of 6 pieces.
   - Therefore, the remaining gum is 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.
   - Jim gives half of the remaining 14 pieces to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
   - After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

So, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."
"To find out how old Charmaine will be 4 years from now, we first need to determine her current age. If she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can subtract 12 from 16 to find her current age:

16 - 12 = 4

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old. To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we add 4 to her current age:

4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach. He bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach. He bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:

\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 85 \]"
"To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.
2. Determine the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.

First, calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, calculate the number of flowers that have bloomed. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed:
\[ \text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the internet speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we know that Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we can convert kb to Mb by dividing by 1000:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per second} = \frac{20 \text{ kb}}{1000 \text{ kb/Mb}} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb per hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/second} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb per hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is:

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on these four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

To ride the roller coaster, Adam needs to be 4 feet tall. The difference in height needed is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2 \times 6}{3 \times 1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Adam will need 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost the company paid is:

\[ \text{Cost paid by the company} = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the cost paid by the company:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{James's commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = 2000 \)
- \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \)
- \( S = G - 400 \)

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

\[
16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. The relative speed of Tom with respect to Bob is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour. This means Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Bob is initially 75 miles ahead of Tom. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the initial distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
2. Now, since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 11 fish, Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). The total cost for 10 classes is $60. Therefore, the cost per class is:
\[ x = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the condition that the cost per class exceeds $10.

Therefore, Manny can miss all 10 classes before they don't sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the weekly customers processed by both Julie and Jewel to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Jewel's weekly customers} + \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can find out how many miles Lynn ran by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's total distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we find the cost of one apple:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Next, we find the cost of one orange:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \(T\) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tim's annual salary after the raise and bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the raise amount.
2. Calculate the bonus amount.
3. Add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary.
4. Multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary.

Let's start with the raise:

- Original monthly salary: $20000
- Raise percentage: 5%
- Raise amount = 5% of $20000 = 0.05 * $20000 = $1000

Next, the bonus:

- Bonus amount = Half a month's salary = 0.5 * $20000 = $10000

Now, we add the raise and bonus to the original salary to get the new monthly salary:

- New monthly salary = Original salary + Raise amount + Bonus amount
- New monthly salary = $20000 + $1000 + $10000 = $31000

Finally, we calculate the annual salary:

- Annual salary = New monthly salary * 12 months
- Annual salary = $31000 * 12 = $372000

So, the final numerical answer is $372000."

"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the sales from green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from red hats} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total sales in the first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to find the sales in the second month. According to the problem, the sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month:

\[ \text{Sales in the second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we can calculate the total sales over the two months by adding the sales from the first month and the sales from the second month:

\[ \text{Total sales over two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since each deviled egg half is made from 2 whole eggs, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \times \frac{1 \text{ whole egg}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many dozens of eggs are required. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper, which means she has written \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) pages.

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\( 15 - 5 = 10 \) pages.

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write. The final numerical answer is 10."
"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

The total number of days required to read the book is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, we can find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the number of days he needs to read the book from the total deadline days:
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the initial cost of the plane and the monthly costs for renting a hanger and fuel, then sum these up for a full year.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   The cost for fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   The total monthly cost for renting the hanger and fuel is:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

5. **Annual Cost:**
   To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 months:
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane and the annual cost for renting and fueling the plane:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}
\]"
"Let's denote the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. It took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice to cook beans, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 + 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum up the cooking times for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animal legs is 70.
2. The total number of animal heads is 20.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can solve these equations step by step. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S \]

Next, substitute \( G \) in the first equation:

\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To verify, we can find the number of geese \( G \):

\[ G = 20 - S = 20 - 15 = 5 \]

Now, let's check the total number of legs:

\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The total number of heads is:

\[ S + G = 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \)."

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

The total amount spent is $20.00.

The cost of the 2 bag of chips is $2.00 each, so 2 bags cost $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

The cost of the bucket of fried chicken is $8.00.

The cost of the bottle of soda is $1.00.

So, the total cost of the items bought is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent gives us the cost of the apple pie:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, the calculation is as follows:

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered in a day - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209 = 203

So, James delivers 203 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class time and then figure out how many 1.5-hour segments fit into that total time.

First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends:
- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each class session lasts 2 hours.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

Total class hours = (Number of sessions per week) × (Hours per session) × (Number of weeks)
Total class hours = 4 × 2 × 6
Total class hours = 48

Next, we need to determine how many 1.5-hour segments fit into the total class hours:
Number of recipes = Total class hours / (Hours per recipe)
Number of recipes = 48 / 1.5
Number of recipes = 32

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 32."
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers and math teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount equally among the three of them, each person would get:

"To determine the total tablespoons of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total tablespoons of each ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

Total tablespoons of dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total tablespoons of dry ingredients = 8.25 * 16

Let's calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients for 16 muffins.
```python
# Calculation for 16 muffins
total_dry_ingredients_per_muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25
total_dry_ingredients_for_16_muffins = total_dry_ingredients_per_muffin * 16
total_dry_ingredients_for_16_muffins
```
```output
SyntaxError: cannot assign to operator

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to first establish the total number of good days and then subtract the number of good days that have already occurred.

Christina recorded her moods over 30 days. We know the following:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[ \text{Total days} - \text{Good days} - \text{Bad days} = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]
So, there were 10 neutral days.

Next, we verify the distribution of good days over the 30 days:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

This means the first 8 days had 8 good days, the next 8 days had 0 good days, and the last 8 days had 0 good days. Therefore, the total number of good days is:
\[ 8 \text{ (first 8 days)} + 0 \text{ (next 8 days)} + 0 \text{ (last 8 days)} = 8 \text{ good days} \]

However, we know from the problem statement that there are actually 12 good days. This discrepancy suggests that the distribution of good days over the 30 days is not as straightforward as initially thought. But we can still use the given information to find the number of good days left.

The next three days are described as good, neutral, and good. This means the next three days will add 2 more good days to the total count of good days. Since we already know there are 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ good days} \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books, so:
\[ J = 21 \]

Substituting the value of \( J \) into the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the current height of the bamboo is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. The difference in height needed is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 12 days."
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(4 + 8 = 12\).

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs one toy per dog.
   - He needs 12 toys to accommodate the 12 dogs.
   - After buying the toys, he has 12 toys.

3. **Second Purchase:**
   - James went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs means \(2 \times 12 = 24\) more dogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(12 + 24 = 36\).
   - James needs 36 toys to accommodate the 36 dogs.
   - After buying the toys, he has 36 toys.

4. **Third Purchase:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is \(36 - 3 = 33\).
   - James needs 33 toys to accommodate the 33 dogs.
   - After buying the toys, he has 33 toys.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is 33."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480

Therefore, 96 potatoes can make 192 hash browns."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they all have:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S \]
\[ \text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 298 \]

The total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation for the final length as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm. Let's confirm this by calculating the final length:
\[ 80 + 0.5 \times 80 + 20 = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \]

The calculations confirm that the original length of the dress was indeed 80 cm. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half of his lawn in turtle mode and the time it takes to mow the other half in rabbit mode, and then sum these times.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In turtle mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In rabbit mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode.

For turtle mode:
- Half of the lawn in turtle mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode.

For rabbit mode:
- Half of the lawn in rabbit mode would take half of the time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half of the lawn in rabbit mode.

Now, we sum the times for both halves of the lawn:
- Time in turtle mode: 30 minutes
- Time in rabbit mode: 20 minutes

Total time to mow the entire lawn:
\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:

"Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so she bakes \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies. Together, they bake \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies. After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left in the box is \(90 - 10 = 80\). Therefore, the final numerical answer is 80."
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

Also, we know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total time John needs to complete his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 3 hours equals 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time John has before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

Let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

This $1.20 is the cost of four candies. To find the cost of one candy, we divide $1.20 by 4:
\[ \$1.20 \div 4 = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Now we know that each lollipop costs $0.40 and each candy costs $0.30. We need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves per month and per year:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so Rong saves \(20 \times 12 = 240\) coins per year.

Next, we calculate how many coins Rong saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Rong saves \(240 \times 10 = 2400\) coins.

Now, let's determine how many coins Neil saves per month:
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. This means Neil saves \(20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

Next, we calculate how many coins Neil saves per year:
- Neil saves \(28 \times 12 = 336\) coins per year.

Now, we calculate how many coins Neil saves in ten years:
- In ten years, Neil saves \(336 \times 10 = 3360\) coins.

Finally, we add the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years:
- Total coins saved by Rong and Neil = \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

The final numerical answer is:
5760"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. Therefore, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the heartworm check. We know that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price for a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, so it is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The cost of 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.
- The cost of 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

\[5 + 6 + 21 = 32\]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to determine the number of each colored square and then calculate the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up the total number of squares:
- Total number of squares = Number of red squares + Number of blue squares + Number of green squares + Number of white squares
- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
- Total area = 68 square feet

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of chairs needed for the function. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people attending is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant is:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs required:

"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate how much she puts into her retirement account and how much she pays for her car, and then subtract these amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate how much she puts into her retirement account:
\[ \text{Retirement Contribution} = 50\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.50 \times \$2400.00 = \$1200.00 \]

Next, let's calculate how much she pays for her car:
\[ \text{Car Payment} = 20\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.20 \times \$2400.00 = \$480.00 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she contributes to her retirement and pays for her car from her total paycheck:
\[ \text{Money Left} = \$2400.00 - \$1200.00 - \$480.00 = \$720.00 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost James paid for picking the blueberries. The cost includes a fixed fee and a variable fee based on the weight of the blueberries he picked.

The fixed fee is $20, and the variable fee is $1.5 per pound. James picked 30 pounds of blueberries, so the variable fee is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5/\text{pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the fixed fee to the variable fee gives the total cost James paid:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5/\text{pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself, we subtract the cost he paid from the cost he would have paid at the store:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original price per computer is:
\[ \text{Original price per computer} = \frac{700}{500} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the new price after a 10% increase. A 10% increase means the new price is 110% of the original price. So, the new price per computer is:
\[ \text{New price per computer} = 1.40 \times 1.10 = 1.54 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:

Next, we need to find out how many of these interviewees receive a job offer. Since 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer, we calculate:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Finally, we need to find out how many of these job offer recipients accept the position. Since a third of the job offer recipients accept the position, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2."
"Goldy gave away a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which sums up to 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, the total amount of rice she gave away is 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 175."
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to calculate the total number of boxes she bought this week and subtract the number of boxes she bought last week.

This week, she bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, which totals to:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

Now, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the different rates at which she dances.

First, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

For 3 minutes (since she dances for a total of 5 minutes and her arms are raised for 2 minutes):
- Total taps = 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Combined, both feet tap at 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.

For 2 minutes (since her arms are raised for 2 minutes):
- Total taps = 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

Now, we add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:
- Total taps = 1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is:
\[
\boxed{2450}
\]"
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then compare it to the potential damage to his car.

1. **Cost of asphalt:**
   - Ron needs 3 buckets of asphalt.
   - Each bucket costs $25.
   - Total cost for asphalt = 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.

2. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance:**
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.

3. **Total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Total cost = Cost of asphalt + Fine for unauthorized road maintenance
   - Total cost = $75 + $120 = $195.

4. **Damage to the car:**
   - If the pothole is not fixed, it will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car.

5. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**
   - Money saved = Damage to the car - Total cost of fixing the pothole
   - Money saved = $450 - $195 = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:
- Normal chairs left: 150
- Baby chairs left: 10
- Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

The final numerical answer is 160."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices eaten and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

First, let's determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his 4 friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. Each of these 3 people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, each of these 3 people ate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the total number of slices eaten by these 3 people is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these 2 people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, each of these 2 people ate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the total number of slices eaten by these 2 people is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all 5 people, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. Therefore, we calculate the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages as follows:

\[
\text{Time for dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time taken by the cat and the dog, and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length of Topher's shoe as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed by Hannah for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:

\[ \text{Windows smashed by students} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed by Hannah for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows:

\[ \text{Windows smashed by teachers} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the windows smashed by students and teachers to find the total number of windows smashed by Hannah:

\[ \text{Total windows smashed} = 64 + 48 = 112 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 112 \]"
"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

First, we calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00). Since 2/5 of the people had voted by midday, we have:

\[ \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means that the number of people remaining by midday is:

\[ \text{Remaining people by midday} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00, we have:

\[ \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

This means that the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[ \text{People who had not voted by 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in that time.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

A pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he will need, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves of graham crackers, they will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
Substituting the father's age:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of her French book:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the weight of her English book:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the weight of her history book, which is twice the weight of her English book:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each person has after this exchange:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10 to Beck} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, let's sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, let's determine how much water Peter has left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water used = 30 ounces.
- Water left = 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
2 ounces"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

"To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students in each class.
2. Calculate the number of girls in each class.
3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

First, since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can find the number of students in each class by dividing 80 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Now, to find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24."

So, the family will be able to save 28 dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor:
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily cost from the new vendor:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor:
- The old vendor sold tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor sold 500 tomatoes a day.

Daily cost from the old vendor:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, we find the daily savings:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$350/\text{week} \]

Thus, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, given the relationships between the number of marbles they have.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:
\[
\text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. We need to divide these students into 12 groups of equal size. To find the number of students per group, we perform the division:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form, implying that the current number of groups (6) is insufficient for the activity to be divided into 12 groups.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the current number of groups from the required number of groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

- Weekend rental: 100 chairs per day

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays: \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs
- Total chairs rented during weekends: \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."
"To determine how many bananas Gunther found in the pile, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of bananas step by step.

1. **Initial number of bananas**: Gunther had 48 bananas.
2. **Arnold steals half**: Arnold stole half of the bananas, so the number of bananas left is:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas**: After adding 25 bananas, the number of bananas becomes:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas**: After Arnold steals 12 bananas, the number of bananas left is:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. **Gunther adds 6 bananas**: After adding 6 bananas, the number of bananas becomes:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43
   \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43. 

\[
\boxed{43}

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first need to calculate the total annual cost of the electricity bill and then divide that by the number of roommates.

The monthly cost of the electricity bill is $100. Therefore, the annual cost is:
\[ 100 \times 12 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 4 roommates, each roommate will pay:
\[ \frac{1200}{4} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
- He sent 4 dozen plates, which is 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Next, let's account for the items that were returned broken:

- 10 glasses were broken, so he has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left.
- 6 plates were broken, so he has 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

Now, let's add the remaining glasses and plates together:

- Total remaining items = 86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items.

So, the final numerical answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the trades step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, which is equivalent to 1 large button.
   - Therefore, 27 small buttons are worth 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - 10% of 30 small stickers = 0.1 * 30 = 3 small stickers.
   - These 3 small stickers remain with Lorraine.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers are worth 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - These 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Large Buttons:**
   - From trading small stickers: 27 large buttons.
   - From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons.
   - Total large buttons = 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons.

Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 47."

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we first need to calculate the total number of songs across all playlists and then multiply that by the length of each song.

1. Calculate the total number of songs in all playlists:
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist} \]
\[ \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \]

2. Calculate the total number of hours for all songs:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Length of each song} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

Given that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \text{ are Pomeranians} \]

Also, one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \text{ are Pomeranian girls} \]

We know that there are 6 Pomeranian girls, so:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's calculate how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's initial money: $70
Ava's allowance: $90
Half of Ava's allowance: $90 / 2 = $45

So, Jayden receives $45 from his sister. Adding this to his initial amount:

Jayden's total money after receiving from his sister: $70 + $45 = $115

The cost of the new camera is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

Amount needed: $200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $85."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour. Therefore, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read. 

Ahmed's books read in one hour = 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Next, we are told that Ezra decided to read 150 more books. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Now, we need to find out how many books Ahmed has read in total. Since Ahmed read 150 books in one hour, and there's no mention of him reading more books later, the total number of books Ahmed read is 150.

Finally, to find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add the books read by each:
Total books read = Ezra's books + Ahmed's books = 450 + 150 = 600 books.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching."

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

First, we calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance back is the same, the time taken to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \( 57 \times 4 = 228 \) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \( 73 \times 2 = 146 \) wheels.

Now, let's add the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
- Total wheels needed = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles
- Total wheels needed = 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:

1. **Movies in series:**
   - A third of the movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series = \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost for these movies = \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \)

2. **Remaining movies:**
   - Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies in series = \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)

3. **Older movies:**
   - 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies = \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \)
   - Cost for these movies = \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \)

4. **Normal movies:**
   - The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   - Number of normal movies = \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost for these movies = \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \)

5. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for series movies + Cost for older movies + Cost for normal movies

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of that speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:

"Let's denote Emma's score as \( E \) and Ava's score as \( A \).

Ava's score is calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times (E + 8) \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times (E + 3) \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times (60 - 4) = 30 \times 56 = 1680 \)

So, Ava's total score is:
\[ A = 10(E + 8) + 5(E + 3) + 1680 \]
\[ A = 10E + 80 + 5E + 15 + 1680 \]
\[ A = 15E + 1795 \]

Emma's score is calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points for berries: \( 5(E + 3) \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \)

So, Emma's total score is:
\[ E = 10E + 5(E + 3) + 1800 \]
\[ E = 10E + 5E + 15 + 1800 \]
\[ E = 15E + 1815 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ A - E = (15E + 1795) - (15E + 1815) \]
\[ A - E = 15E + 1795 - 15E - 1815 \]
\[ A - E = 1795 - 1815 \]
\[ A - E = -20 \]

The difference between their two scores is \(-20\), meaning Emma's score is 20 points higher than Ava's score. Therefore, the difference between their scores is:

\[
\boxed{-20}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each. The total cost of these two pizzas is:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:

\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify this equation:

\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( o - 2w = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( o \):

\[ 2o + 2w = 34 \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

Now, we add these two equations together:

\[ 2o + 2w + o - 2w = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3o = 39 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

Now that we have \( o = 13 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( w \):

\[ 13 + w = 17 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy drives from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.
   - The one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.
   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - Total distance driven in a week is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of gas consumed in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG.
   - Therefore, the amount of gas consumed in a week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ MPG}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3/gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of the gas consumed in a week is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times $3/\text{gallon} = $15\).

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, and she has 140 quarters, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, and she has 10 twenties, the total amount in twenties is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. So, the amount spent on twenties is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amount spent on quarters and the amount spent on twenties to find the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch:

\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

Total tomatoes = 22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

Total eggplants = 4 eggplants/plant * 8 plants = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants to find the total number of fruits:
Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

So, the final numerical answer is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total cost of the trip and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school has agreed to cover half of this cost, which means the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150. 

John has $50. Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is the total cost minus the amount he has, which is $300 - $50 = $250.

So, the final numerical answer is $250."
"First, we need to determine the temperature difference that needs to be addressed to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the night temperature is 12 degrees, we need to increase the temperature by:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate how many seashells were brought back.

First, we need to find the number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour for regular hours.

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours she worked, which is 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours. She is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate for these additional hours. Her regular hourly rate is $20, so her special hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 150\% \times \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Special pay} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her special pay to find her total pay for the day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on last Tuesday."

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are on sale for 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the jeans are now priced at:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the discounted price of the jeans from $50.00:

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees after three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage of his employment:

1. **Initial Hourly Wage:**
   - Billy's initial hourly wage was $10 per hour.

2. **After 2 months:**
   - Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New hourly wage: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **On his first anniversary:**
   - Billy received another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New hourly wage: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's total earnings for 20 hours of work at each of his hourly rates:

1. **Initial 20 hours:**
   - Hourly wage: $10 per hour.
   - Total earnings: $10 * 20 = $200.

2. **Next 20 hours:**
   - Hourly wage: $10.50 per hour.
   - Total earnings: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

3. **Final 20 hours:**
   - Hourly wage: $11.50 per hour.
   - Total earnings: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Summing up Billy's total earnings over the 60 hours:
\[ 200 + 210 + 230 = 640 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine Sally's hourly wage:

1. **Sally's starting hourly wage:**
   - Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial hourly wage.
   - Sally's hourly wage: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Sally's total earnings for 20 hours of work at her hourly wage:

1. **Sally's total earnings:**
   - Hourly wage: $10.50 per hour.
   - Total earnings: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally:

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Puppies: 3
- Koalas: 5
- Zebras: 2
- Frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying \( x \) goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of goats to be 30% of all stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the hours played in the last week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added:

Cost of diamond = $600
Cost of gold = $300

Total cost before premium = $600 + $300 = $900

Now, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium:

Premium = 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost including premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, the final numerical answer is $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 students passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 students passed.
- Fifth graders: 400 students passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 400 = 780 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students tested, which is \( \frac{780}{1000} = 0.78 \) or 78%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 78%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students have consumed the tea. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies (150 - 100 = 50). After ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. To find out how many more he needs to sell to have all his candies sold, we subtract the number of candies he already has from the total he ordered and received:

200 (total candies now) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."

   - Students who joined = 320 - 10 = 310

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. We know that he made $105 and that each branch costs $0.25.

First, we calculate the total number of branches he climbed:
\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. Assuming he worked every day of the week (7 days), we divide the total number of branches by 7:
\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{7} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she initially picks:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each of the 4 types, so she drops:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ flowers} \]

The total number of petals of the flowers she drops is:
\[ 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the total gives:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

The bag initially contains 35 marshmallows. After John and DeSean make their S'mores, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows lost is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, each kid can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, John and DeSean can each have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. His two friends who are worse than him can play for half as long as Jack, which is 120 minutes each. The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 360 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends:
- Jack: 240 minutes
- Friend 1 (worse): 120 minutes
- Friend 2 (worse): 120 minutes
- Friend 3 (better): 360 minutes

Total play time = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since each game lasts 20 minutes and costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \frac{840 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 42 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 42 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (twice as much salt as zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to multiply the number of each type of animal by its price and then add the totals together.

For the goats:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Now, we add the totals:
$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he should buy, we can subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

\[ 63 - (8 + 40) = 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has initially:
\[ \text{Joe's initial cars} = 2 \times \text{Robert's cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cars sold} = 20\% \times 40 = 0.2 \times 40 = 8 \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:
\[ \text{Cars left after selling} = 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:
\[ \text{Cars given to mother} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:
\[ \text{Cars left after giving to mother} = 32 - 16 = 16 \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide $125,000 by 20:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days in minutes.

First, let's determine the time Sandy spent walking on the first day. According to the problem, she walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we need to find out how much time she spent walking on the second day. The problem states that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time spent walking on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent walking on both days to find the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in the parking lot at the start of the lunch break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. **Cars Remaining During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate his daily earnings:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 tasks.
- Each task pays $1.20.

So, the earnings per cycle are:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Now, his daily earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00/\text{day} = \$1260.00/\text{week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1260.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game and the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now we can find the number of cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3

Let's calculate the total:

\[ 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \]

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The loss Milly will incur is the total shipping cost minus the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:
\[ 3.00 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = -21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the loss is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21.00. However, the question asks for the amount of money Milly will lose, which in this case is $0 (since she gains $21.00).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has before making any purchases:

- Initial amount: $40
- Amount given by her father: $100

Total amount before purchases = $40 + $100 = $140

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

- Two pairs of jeans at $30 each: 2 * $30 = $60
- A bag for $20

Total cost of purchases = $60 + $20 = $80

Finally, let's calculate how much money Mulan has left after the purchases:

Money left = Total amount before purchases - Total cost of purchases
Money left = $140 - $80 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Total production for the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

Therefore, the production in the fourth week is:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final numerical answer is 14,000 bars."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down the time spent on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the total time spent on TikTok videos is \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, 2 hours equal \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, the total time spent on makeup is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In a month with four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on TikTok-related activities:
\[ 288 \text{ minutes (videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{1128}{60} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks is:
\[ 18.8 \text{ hours} \]"
"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the base cost and the additional cost for the extra items.

First, let's calculate the base cost. The base cost includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

The cost for these items is $129.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors (6 - 4 = 2 additional mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (2 - 1 = 1 additional chandelier)
- 20 pictures (20 - 10 = 10 additional pictures)

The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

Let's calculate the cost for the additional items:
- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Now, we add the base cost and the cost for the additional items:
- Total cost = Base cost + Additional cost
- Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00

Let's sum these up:
- Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $224.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony's savings can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's savings:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{42.00} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of the individuals step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To calculate the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the time it takes them to cross the highway.

Let's denote the speed of each kangaroo as \( v \) and the distance across the highway as \( d \).

Given that it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can write the equation for the distance \( d \) as:
\[ d = 3v \times 18 \]
\[ d = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( d \). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Let \( t \) be the time it takes for the 4 turtles to travel the distance \( d \). The distance \( d \) can also be expressed as:
\[ d = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t \]
\[ d = 2v \times t \]

Since the distance \( d \) is the same in both scenarios, we can set the two expressions for \( d \) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2v \times t \]

We can solve for \( t \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 2v \):
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} \]
\[ t = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kora makes 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, to find the total number of clay dishes they all make together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[ \text{Total} = \text{Kora's dishes} + \text{Rory's dishes} + \text{Jada's dishes} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to buy the laptop is $350, and she has $230, so the amount in her purse must be $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices Adam gets from the apples is:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the current daily milk production and then find out how much additional milk is needed.

The current daily milk production from 3 cows is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}

"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jack has 60 dishes, so:
\[ D = 60 \]

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2S \) socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{D}{2} \) dishes. Since \( D = 60 \), Peter has:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ dishes} \]

Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so:
\[ D = 2S \]
Since \( D = 60 \), we can solve for \( S \):
\[ 60 = 2S \]
\[ S = 30 \]

So, Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time for one group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time available for the concert:
- Total concert duration: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Subtract the intermission time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform in the available time:
- Total time available: 110 minutes
- Time required per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups that can perform = Total time available / Time required per group = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( I \) is the interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) percent per year (since three-quarters of the original amount is 75%, and 75% of $300 is $225),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, we calculate the interest:
\[ I = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]
\[ I = 300 \times 675 \]
\[ I = 202500 \] dollars.

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ A = P + I \]
\[ A = 300 + 202500 \]
\[ A = 202800 \] dollars.

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

Next, let's determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons.

- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars.

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

The difference is:

30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts without collars. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. Since there are 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]

In a separate line:

"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats left in Farm X after selling 10 goats.
2. Calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y after selling twice as many goats as were sold from Farm X.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total.

Let's start with Farm X:
- Initially, there are 55 goats in Farm X.
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

Next, let's calculate for Farm Y:
- Initially, there are 45 goats in Farm Y.
- Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Now, we add the remaining goats from both farms:
- Goats left in Farm X: 45
- Goats left in Farm Y: 25
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\).

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount he spends on shoes each year by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (12 months), he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year, so the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \frac{2640}{24} = 110 \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- Therefore, the total cost for the green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the discount per basket is $2.
- Therefore, the total discount for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.
- The total cost for the red food after applying the discount is \( 3 \times 18 - 6 = 54 - 6 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, we add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food to find the overall total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
- Total cost = 75 + 48 = 123

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned: \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms: \( 45 \times 20 \) minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: \( \frac{45 \times 20}{60} \) hours.

Let's do the math:

- Total time in minutes: \( 45 \times 20 = 900 \) minutes.
- Total time in hours: \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

First, we know that in the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

Next, in the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]
So, the number of homes built in the third year is:
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Let's denote my age as \( x \). Then, my brother's age is \( x + 3 \) and my sister's age is \( x - 2 \). My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To verify, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks left over. Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river over the three days.

1. **First Day**: The initial amount of water is 4000 gallons.
2. **Second Day**: The amount of water doubles from the first day. Therefore, the amount of water on the second day is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **Third Day**: The amount of water increases by 6000 gallons from the second day. Therefore, the amount of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days is the sum of the amounts from each day:
\[
4000 \text{ gallons} + 8000 \text{ gallons} + 14000 \text{ gallons} = 26000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people each day, starting with the initial number of infected people and considering the daily infection rate.

1. **Initial number of infected people:** 10
2. **Number of people infected on the first day:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Number of people infected on the second day:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Number of people infected on the third day:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). Therefore, the total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta received, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract it from Rafaela's total:

\[ \text{10% of Rafaela's total tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we add the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the combined total:

\[ \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

The final numerical answer is 3 oranges."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges Claire earns in a year. Since Claire earns 1 badge every month, in a year (12 months), she earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Amber to earn a badge. According to the problem, it takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire takes 1 month to earn a badge, Amber takes:
\[ 2 \text{ months} \]
to earn a badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we know that Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges, so the difference is:
\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \]

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige baked:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours:
- Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour.
- Therefore, in 5 hours, she baked \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) banana bread loaves.

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from the 10 loaves:
- Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the total number of slices is \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) slices.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 80 slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \) dollars.

So, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( S + 30 \).

We are given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ S + 30 = 70 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

The total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed.
3. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered:

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 12 red cars.
- There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
- There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Adding these up gives us the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The rink has a total of 75 cars. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation. First, we express \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we get \( A \).
- From \( S = A + 25 \), we substitute \( A = F - 12 \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's verify this:
- If Fawn has 28 books, then Anne has \( 28 - 12 = 16 \) books.
- Sofie has \( 16 + 25 = 41 \) books.
- The total number of books is \( 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \), which matches the given total.

Therefore, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of small jello cups Greg wants to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required to make 120 jello cups. We know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month.

Given that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 per month, we can calculate her monthly payment as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, so the number of pieces remaining after the second day is:

\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

So, after the third day, the number of pieces remaining is:

\[
26 - 14 = 12 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far by adding the pieces he ate on the first, second, and third days:

\[
24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
48

"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah sold. We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses of lemonade, and Julie sold 14 glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together is:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the 18 glasses equally between them:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hairdo is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of the hairdo, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of the hairdo, manicure, and pedicure:
\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter.

\[
\text{Total cost of the rope} = 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to know how much money she will have after selling the original rope.

Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total revenue from selling the rope is $40. Therefore, she will have $40 to spend on the new rope.

Now, we need to determine how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40:

\[
\text{Number of meters of the new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{3} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope.

Next, we calculate the cost of 26 meters of the new rope:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters of the new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, to find out how much money she will have left over after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Money left over} = 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

We need to find the number of years, \( x \), from now when Melanie's age will be 24. This can be expressed as:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item Kelly has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bacon} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10, a pack of chicken costs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost of chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost of apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 120 + 12 + 14 = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 196 = -131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the items. She is short by:
\[
131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. After giving away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

"To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made each day and then sum them up.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones are left after 20% of them are not able to fit in pairs. 

First, calculate 20% of the total microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, the number of pairs is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- There are 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
- There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we can add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

Total number of birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

So, the final numerical answer is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, leaving her with 55 - 5 = 50 cookies. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, each jar contained 50 / 5 = 10 cookies.

"To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals}\).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \(40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals}\).

So, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final numerical answer is:

15"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is 25%."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob is:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"Let's break down the costs:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for her daily diet is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so the total hours worked in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week. So, $12 per hour * 40 hours = $480.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week."
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 3x \) lawns for Kamala.

From the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed \( 5x \) lawns for Alba.

The total number of lawns mowed for Joe, Kamala, and Alba is \( x + 3x + 5x = 9x \).

Given that Joe paid her $6 for mowing his lawn, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns as \( 6 \times 9x = 54x \).

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, the earnings from mowing lawns alone is $54x, and the earnings from lemonade sales is \( 80 - 54x \).

To find the value of \( x \), we need to recognize that \( x \) must be a whole number and \( 54x \) must be a whole number. Since $80 is the total earnings and $54x$ is the earnings from mowing lawns, \( 80 - 54x \) must be a whole number. The only value of \( x \) that satisfies this condition is \( x = 1 \) because \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) and \( 80 - 54 = 26 \).

Thus, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

The final numerical answer is:
26"
"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets paid $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. To do this, we subtract his monthly car payment from the total amount he earns from renting his car:

\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

So, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ \$250/\text{month} \]

In a separate line, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to first understand the capacity of the pot in terms of adult and child bowls.

The pot can fill:
- 4 adult's bowls
- 8 child's bowls

Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will eat one bowl of soup as well. This means that 2 adult bowls are already used. The pot can fill 4 adult's bowls, so there are 2 adult bowls left.

Now, we need to determine how many child's bowls can be filled with the remaining 2 adult bowls. Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child's bowls, 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child's bowls. Therefore, the 2 remaining adult bowls can be converted into 4 child's bowls.

Calvin and his wife have 2 children, and each child will get one bowl of soup. So, the 4 child's bowls can be distributed among the 2 children, meaning each child can have 2 bowls of soup.

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, let's denote Duncan's age eight years ago as \(D_{-8}\) and Adam's age four years ago as \(A_{-4}\).

Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we can express his age eight years ago as:
\[D_{-8} = 60 - 8 = 52\]

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[D_{-8} = 2 \cdot A_{-4}\]
\[52 = 2 \cdot A_{-4}\]
\[A_{-4} = \frac{52}{2} = 26\]

Now, we need to find Adam's current age. Since Adam's age four years ago was 26, his current age is:
\[A_{-4} + 4 = 26 + 4 = 30\]

Finally, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

"First, let's calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres. 

Adding 100 acres to this, we get \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres. 

\[
\boxed{700}

"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. 

So, the number of packages he completes per hour is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in an eight-hour workday he completes:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. Therefore, his total earnings for the day are:
\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"First, let's determine the time John spends on an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour. Therefore, in 180 minutes, he drinks:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles of water} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that \( R = 20 \) and the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total pieces of bologna thrown can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to isolate \( 3Y \):
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( Y \):
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups needed by dividing the total distance by 1000:

\[ \text{Number of tune-ups} = \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} = 3 \, \text{tune-ups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 3."
"To find the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we need to calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

1. **Tuesday**: Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. **Wednesday**: Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. **Thursday**: Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's break down the expenses and the money they spent:

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost of 12 balloons is \(12 \times 0.25 = $3\).
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is \(2 \times 7 = $14\).

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[11 + 3 + 14 = 28\]

This means Julia and Nadine spent a total of $28. Since they combined their allowances, each of them received half of the total amount. Therefore, each of them received:
\[28 \div 2 = 14\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14. The final numerical answer is:
\[14\]"
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit. If Lola ate 2 pieces, then the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

"To find the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students playing each sport and then sum them up.

First, we know that there are 6 students playing tennis. 

Next, we are told that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis. Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

We are also given that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Therefore, the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Now, we sum the number of students playing each sport to find the total number of students:
\[ 6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \]

So, the total number of students is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats.

2. **Number of Dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Number of Rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Number of Fish:**
   Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Number of Gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Therefore, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets:
\[
3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so he can eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day. Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day. Given that there are 24 slices in the loaf of bread, the loaf will last \(24 \div 6 = 4\) days. 

The final numerical answer is 4."
"Martha collects shells every month starting from when she was 5 years old until she turns 10 years old. 

To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in age and then convert that into months. 

Martha was 5 years old and will be 10 years old, so she has been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since there are 12 months in a year, she has been collecting shells for \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells. 

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, let's determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row. Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that in each row, there are 9 cups of tea (since 27 cups divided by 3 rows equals 9 cups per row). Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea.

Now, we need to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row. Since each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time spent on each trip:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in that time.

The time spent on each trip is 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the number of trips he can make is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many berries he can pick up per trip. Since he needs to collect 24 berries in total and he makes 2 trips, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on popcorn and candy:
- He bought 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8, so the total cost for popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He bought 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2, so the total cost for candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from the total amount of money he has:
- Colby has $150 initially.
- After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, he has \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars left.

Now, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $126. Since he is on a Friday, the ticket price is $10. We need to find out how many $10 tickets he can buy with $126:
- The number of movies he can see is \( \frac{126}{10} = 12.6 \).

Since he can only see a whole number of movies, we take the integer part of the division, which is 12.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
12"
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- So, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- So, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

The final numerical answer is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299. To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance it travels is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance it travels is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys Sophie already has from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of other toys Sophie has is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
\[ P + Q + J = 100 \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Q = J + 10 \]

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
\[ P = Q + J \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \) years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

They also have 10 boxes of their own stuff, so the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes of stuff. Therefore, the number of tables needed to fit all the boxes is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

Therefore, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 12-hour and the 24-hour options, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The base cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 24 hours, which is exactly 24 hours, so there are no additional hours to pay for.

The cost for the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour option plus the additional hours:
- The base cost for a 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 24 hours, which means he has 12 additional hours.
- The cost for the additional 12 hours is 12 * 70 pesos = 840 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1000 pesos + 840 pesos = 1840 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The cost for the 24-hour option is 1600 pesos.
- The cost for the 12-hour option plus the additional hours is 1840 pesos.
- The savings is 1840 pesos - 1600 pesos = 240 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 240 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week:

John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since labor is charged for part of an hour as well, we round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Adding these together, the total charge is $40 + $105 + $60 = $205.

So, Patty charged $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the discounted price is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for them:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money James was out is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.50 per yam = $9.00

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2.00 per sweet potato = $20.00

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5.00

Now, we add up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   Add the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17 \text{ hours}}
\]"
"First, let's calculate seven times the number of loaves of bread Sam had last Friday:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, we know the bakery has 40 less than this amount:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers. Then she receives 5 more stickers, so she has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers at the end. 

The final numerical answer is 13."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission for each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Number of copies sold: 6
- Cost per copy: $5
- Commission rate: 10%

The commission per New York Times copy is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission for 6 copies of the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Number of copies sold: 10
- Cost per copy: $15
- Commission rate: 8%

The commission per Wall Street Journal copy is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission for 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ 15.00 \]"
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\).

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, if Marcus is 21, then Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the fact that each page is printed on both sides of the paper.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each page is printed on both sides of the paper.
- The stack of paper is 100 pages per inch.

First, we calculate the total number of pages in the stack that corresponds to the thickness of the book:
\[ \text{Total number of pages in the stack} = \text{Thickness of the book} \times \text{Pages per inch} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pages in the stack} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pages in the stack} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

Since each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages in the book is half the number of pages in the stack:
\[ \text{Total number of pages in the book} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages in the stack}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pages in the book} = \frac{150}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pages in the book} = 75 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate the total number of reports he stapled.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time she was not sleeping on her bed that day is 23 minutes. To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we subtract the sleepwalking time from her total sleep time:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 457 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ 457 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 24 cups.

The number of measuring spoons Jonathan has is:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has after giving 6 to Pedro is:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Total number of utensils} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means Robyn sends six emails to her family each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after sending emails to her family. The number of emails that are not work, not family, and not sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

According to the problem, one-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends one email to her boyfriend each day. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney. Courtney reported 48 people, and Kelly said this was an overstatement by 20%.

First, we calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

Next, we subtract this value from the number reported by Courtney to find the actual number of attendees:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and typically in such contexts we would round to the nearest whole number, we can conclude that the actual number of people who attended the concert is 38.4, but since we are dealing with a count of people, we would typically round to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in two holes.
3. Calculate the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day.
4. Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but then they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\).

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after the pirates filled in 2 holes:
\[29 - 2 = 27\]

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so four times this number is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 27 = 13\]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number Amora and Lainey received, we can write:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of corn chips by summing the chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To find the cost of the travel tickets, we first need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. Let's verify the solution:

- Adelwolfe caught \( A = 40 \) Pokemon.
- Stan caught \( S = 147 \) Pokemon.
- Alex caught \( X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152 \) Pokemon.

Summing these up:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes and \( E = \frac{M}{2} \).

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( E \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes in total. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - 1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies.

6. **Brownies left over:**
   - Total brownies received: 63
   - Brownies eaten: 18
   - Brownies left over = 63 - 18 = 45 brownies.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is \(0.75 \times 8 = 6\) years.

Now, we sum up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington had initially:

12 boxes

She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away:

2 + 2 = 4 boxes

This means she kept:

12 - 4 = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the remaining 3/4 of the oranges were sold. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she had initially is:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

The number of oranges she kept is:

8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is:

240 oranges - 160 oranges = 80 oranges

So, the final numerical answer is 80 oranges."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

Given that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, we can calculate the number of states in India as follows:

Half the number of states in the USA = 50 / 2 = 25
India has 4 more than this number = 25 + 4 = 29 states

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA:

Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in USA
Total number of states = 29 + 50 = 79

The final numerical answer is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to earn is:

Remaining amount = Total cost - Amount saved
Remaining amount = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Remaining amount / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's start by determining how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = \text{Total cherries} - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{More cherries Robert has than Jerry} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total gingerbread sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie sold:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 6 + 15 = 21 boxes

Now, we calculate the total earnings from the gingerbread and apple pie.

**Earnings from gingerbread:**
- Price per box: $6
- Total gingerbread sold: 25 boxes
- Total earnings: 25 * $6 = $150

**Earnings from apple pie:**
- Price per box: $15
- Total apple pie sold: 21 boxes
- Total earnings: 21 * $15 = $315

Finally, we sum up the total earnings from both days.

**Total earnings:**
- Gingerbread earnings: $150
- Apple pie earnings: $315
- Total: $150 + $315 = $465

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{465}

"To find the cost of the red car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:
\[ 60 + 100 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's dad's current age as \(D\) and his brother's current age as \(B\).

When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 + 5 = 29\) years old. This gives us the equation:
\[29 = \frac{D + 5}{2}\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[58 = D + 5\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[D = 53\]
So, Emil's dad is currently 53 years old.

At that same time, Emil will be 24 years old, and he will be twice as old as his brother. So, his brother will be \(24 / 2 = 12\) years old. This gives us the equation:
\[12 = B + 5\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[B = 7\]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[53 + 7 = 60\]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{60}\)."

- From her mother: 20 beads
- From her sister: 20 beads + 10 beads = 30 beads
- From her friend: 2 * 20 beads = 40 beads

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total number of beads Adrianne has:

Total beads = beads from mother + beads from sister + beads from friend
Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40

Now, let's calculate the sum:

Total beads = 90

So, the final numerical answer is 90 beads."
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:

- Total crawfish = Thursday's catch + Friday's catch + Saturday's catch
- Total crawfish = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

Given that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can now calculate the number of servings:

- Number of servings = Total crawfish / Crawfish per serving
- Number of servings = 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.2 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the remaining number of students is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players and the cheerleaders/band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25 in size. 

To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Each plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between every plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:

\[ 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ new plants} \]

Each new plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 162 \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels his brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

\[ \text{Pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 3 \text{ petunias/basket} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{sweet potato vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total amount Katherine will spend:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used = soil for sunflowers + soil for carnations
- Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil is:
- Remaining soil = total soil - soil used
- Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
- Number of roses = remaining soil
- Number of roses = 3.

The final numerical answer is 3."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year} = \frac{\text{Total yearly savings}}{\text{Cost per pair of shoes}} \]

To find the total yearly savings, we multiply her monthly savings by 12 (months in a year).

\[ \text{Total yearly savings} = \$500.00 \times 12 = \$6,000.00 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. Since she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
- For 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on high for 4 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
- For 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was off for 2 hours:
- The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
- For 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Cooling on low: -6 degrees
- Cooling on high: -12 degrees
- Warming up: +4 degrees

The net temperature change is:
\[
-6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
- Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Next, we need to determine the age difference between Bill's first and second sightings of the comet:
- The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

Now, we calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:
- Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
- The time difference between the first and second sightings is 75 years.
- Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year = \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\).

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the duration of each wolf's howl and then sum them up.

1. **Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 \) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous's howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined howl duration:**
   - Sum the durations of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Therefore, the combined duration in minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total amount he needed minus the money given by his parents, which is $30 - $18 = $12.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old, so \(A = 3\).
3. Alessandro is 4 years old, so \(B = 4\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[A + B + H + W = 20\]
Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
This simplifies to:
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
So:
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]
According to the problem, Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]
Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
So:
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

So, the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's friend will contribute. Walter's friend will contribute $200. Therefore, the total amount collected overall is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer will donate three times the amount collected overall. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice. Let's denote the total number of slices as \( S \). If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, then we can say that each adult gets \( 2 \) slices and each kid gets \( 1 \) slice. 

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices distributed is \( 2 \times 2 + 4 \times 1 = 4 + 4 = 8 \) slices. This means the watermelon is divided into 8 slices.

Since the watermelon is divided into 8 slices and there are 2 adults, each adult gets \( \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage, we convert \( \frac{1}{4} \) to a percentage by multiplying by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we convert this time into minutes:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many minutes Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time he works:

\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining minutes back into hours:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \( 8 \)."

- Number of weeks in a month: 4
- Total cost per month: $40 * 3 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's find the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To calculate the cost to fill the swimming pool, we first need to find the volume of the pool in cubic feet, then convert that volume to gallons, and finally calculate the cost based on the given rate.

The volume \( V \) of the pool can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. There are approximately 7.48052 gallons in a cubic foot. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = V \times 7.48052 \]

\[ G = 1400 \times 7.48052 \]

\[ G = 10472.728 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = G \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 10472.728 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.2728 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost to fill the pool is approximately $1047.27."
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Given that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875

The total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract that from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
- The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons on the first day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda, so she pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons on the first day.

Next, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons on the second day.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days:

- Total water pumped by Wanda: \( 4500 + 3000 = 7500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped by Ms. B: \( 3375 + 1125 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Total water pumped into the tank: \( 7500 + 4500 = 12000 \) gallons.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped into the tank from the tank's total capacity to find out how many gallons are remaining:

- Remaining gallons: \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is 6000 gallons."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ x \times 0.658 \times 0.817 \approx 0.28 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.658 \times 0.817} \]
\[ x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.536} \]
\[ x \approx 0.522 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.2%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10000.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$10000 = 0.20 \times 10000 = \$2000 \]

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, and she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = 25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\)
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these up gives the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[3\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has:

\[ \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 15 \times 60 = 900 \]

Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ \text{Packs given to friends} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} = 15 - 2 = 13 \]

She gave these 13 packs equally to her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend received:

\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Packs given to friends} \times \text{Pieces per pack}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{13 \times 60}{10} = \frac{780}{10} = 78 \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating the price increase over time. The formula is:

"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
\text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times 3.3333 = 60 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate accordingly.

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over a 30-day month.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. According to the problem, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 0.5 \times 12 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes. If one dwarf can mine 18 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves can mine:
\[ 40 \times 18 \text{ pounds/day} = 720 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over a 30-day month. If 40 dwarves can mine 720 pounds of ore per day, then in 30 days they can mine:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month is:

   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Initially, there were 25 red balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of them to burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released. Initially, there were 12 yellow balloons. Sally accidentally released half of them:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

The probability of not having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is the sum of the probabilities of not getting an extension and not convincing the teacher:
\[ 0.60 + 0.80 = 0.40 \]

Thus, the probability of having to turn in the homework in the normal teacher scenario is:
\[ 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 \]

Now, we combine the probabilities of both scenarios:
\[ \text{Probability of having to turn in homework} = (0.50 \times 0.50) + (0.50 \times 0.60) \]
\[ = 0.25 + 0.30 \]
\[ = 0.55 \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to first determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This is the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center minus the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

So, the number of tickets to be distributed is:
\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Now, these 4750 tickets are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, each graduate would receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans he can eat, we need to determine how many sets of 3 small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.
   - Since 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, 150 medium-sized beans are equivalent to:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate her total expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total number of hours she spent on jury duty:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books and pencils.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is 66 dollars."
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we first need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place along the driveway.

The width of the driveway is 24 feet, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. Therefore, the number of bottles is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \]

Richard will need to go from one bottle to the next to drop the candy in each bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the next 8 times, the total time required is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this, first, we need to find out the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, the total number of apples is:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples each can be made from the total of 80 apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Amor buys 2 pounds, so the cost is:
\[ 11 \times 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound. Amor buys 3 pounds, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
\[ 22 + 18 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. After spending $40 on the cheese, the amount of money she will have left is:
\[ 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine his income during college. Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job. During college, his income tripled, so his income became:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

However, he did not work during his 4 years of college, so the income lost is the difference between his pre-college income and his income during college:

\[ 75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time, including the time spent in college. His total income over the 4 years of college would be the sum of his pre-college income and the income during college:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 + 75,000 \times 4 = 100,000 + 300,000 = 400,000 \]

The total amount of money he borrowed is $200,000, and the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time is $400,000. The money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school is the difference between these two amounts:

\[ 400,000 - 200,000 = 200,000 \]

To find out how long it would take to earn this amount of money at his pre-college income of $25,000 per year, we divide the total amount by his pre-college income:

\[ \frac{200,000}{25,000} = 8 \]

So, it would take him 8 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Each piece of fabric is an 8 feet by 10 feet rectangle. To find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply its length by its width:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday based on the information given, and then sum the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

First, let's determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday. The number of letters delivered on Monday is 425.

Calculate one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[
\frac{425}{5} = 85
\]
Then, add 17 to this amount to find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
85 + 17 = 102
\]
So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

Next, we need to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that the number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. We already know that 102 letters were delivered on Tuesday.

Calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 102 = 204
\]
Then, add 5 to this amount to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday:
\[
204 + 5 = 209
\]
So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[
425 \text{ (Monday)} + 102 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 209 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 736
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{736}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average loss: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.1667 \]"
"To find the total population in South America, we can multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Number of people per city

Total population = 130000

Therefore, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"First, let's convert all heights to the same unit for easier comparison. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. He grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each day they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Therefore, the total number of days worked by each painter is:
\[ 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ days/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \]

To convert this into hours, we know that 1 day is 24 hours. So, the total hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours} = \frac{1512}{8} \text{ hours} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 189 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = \$20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), would be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), would be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^2 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), would be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, substituting the initial price \( P_0 = \$20000 \) into the equation for \( P_3 \):
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.627441 \]

Therefore:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.627441 = 12548.82 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \$12548.82 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12548.82 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English, we have:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of German books. Since 10% of the books are written in German, we have:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate how far she has already traveled. She drove 325 kilometers over 4 days. 

Now, we subtract the distance she has already traveled from the total distance to New York City:

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance already traveled: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance already traveled
Distance remaining = 1955 - 325
Distance remaining = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days, and then convert that to gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:

   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 120
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140

"To calculate the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to determine how many tiles are required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet. Given that the kitchen floor has an area of 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find 60% of $120, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads required for the twin beds and the king size bed separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:
- Greg has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the twin beds is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads per week.

Next, let's calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:
- Greg has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- Therefore, the number of loads for the king size bed is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load per week.

Now, let's find the total number of loads per week:
- Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
- Total loads per week = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of loads per year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- Total loads per year = Loads per week * Weeks per year
- Total loads per year = 3 * 52 = 156 loads.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to first calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all the cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams per cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
So, Jake ate 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long. The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's determine how many emails James doesn't respond to in a day. Since 20% of the 80 emails don't require any response, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

This means that the number of emails James responds to in a day is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to in a day by 5:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes
5. **Friday**: 25 classes

Now, we sum these numbers:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Let's add them step by step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

First, we sum up all the scores:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 4:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left from both groups:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas left} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional three is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers. 

First, we determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had issues, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser:
\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost Dennis will incur to buy the butter he needs for 6 dozen croissants, considering the promotion.

First, calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) pounds of butter.

Next, consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
- Under the promotion, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays for 1 pound and gets the second pound at half price.

Let's break down the cost:
- For the first 2 pounds, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.
- For the next 2 pounds, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.
- For the last 2 pounds, he pays full price for 1 pound and half price for the second pound.

Calculate the cost for each 2-pound segment:
- Cost for the first 2 pounds: \( 1 \times 4.00 + 0.5 \times 4.00 = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \)
- Cost for the next 2 pounds: \( 1 \times 4.00 + 0.5 \times 4.00 = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \)
- Cost for the last 2 pounds: \( 1 \times 4.00 + 0.5 \times 4.00 = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \)

Summing up the costs for all 6 pounds:
- Total cost = \( 6.00 + 6.00 + 6.00 = 18.00 \)

Therefore, the total cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{18.00}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 41 guests are attending, we need to calculate the additional cost for the extra guests:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.
- Additional cost = 21 * $6 = $126.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the party:

- Total cost = Rent fee for 20 guests + Additional cost for extra guests = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{4}M \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{3}R \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R \]

Since both Maggie and Riza initially had $60, we can substitute \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \) into the expressions for the money they have left:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

The total amount of money they have left together is:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's add the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He also finished the second 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed another 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 750."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the dozen roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, and Jenny bought 15 roses, she bought 1.25 dozen roses (since 15 roses is 1.25 dozen). Therefore, the cost for the dozen roses is:

\[ 1.25 \times 15 = 18.75 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining cost for the extra 0.25 dozen roses is:

\[ 30 - 18.75 = 11.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After paying for the roses, the change she should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters Jenny will receive is:

\[ \frac{6.25}{0.25} = 25 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from each item Terry sells:

The final numerical answer is $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after 30 minutes = 60 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (65 minutes).
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives (65 minutes).
   - Departure time: 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes = 85 minutes).
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train (20 minutes).
   - Departure time: 85 + 20 = 105 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 85 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 85 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has saved so far. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. She has already saved 120 toothpicks, so she still needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for, expressed as a percentage of the original price.
\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Discount Percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second.

First, let's calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour. Therefore, one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour.

Next, we calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours. Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, it will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs will create in 4 hours. Since each spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given:

Frankie's score = 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Given that Binkie's score is 90, we can calculate Frankie's score as follows:

Frankie's score = 2 * Binkie's score + 15
Frankie's score = 2 * 90 + 15
Frankie's score = 180 + 15
Frankie's score = 195

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"Let's break down the journey:

2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. The total distance he walks is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.
4. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took him to reach the store, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, the amount of money Jenny saved is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet, so we can also write:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of bike sold and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * ($500 / 2) = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from MTB bikes = 65 * $500 = $32,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $32,500 = $111,250

The final numerical answer is $111,250."

"To solve this, let's break down the time John spends on classes and learning each week.

First, let's calculate the total number of periods John has to attend each day:
- A normal student has 6 periods.
- John has 2 extra classes, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in class each day is:
\[ 8 \text{ periods} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

John goes to class 5 days a week, so the total time spent in class each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. So, the time spent on extra learning time each week is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, let's add the time spent in class and the extra learning time to find the total time spent learning each week:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{170}{6} \text{ hours/week} = \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \]"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball reaches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce, so the height on the second bounce is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. 

The final numerical answer is 1000."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means the remaining meat after the velociraptors was 270 kilograms. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of each is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

First, let's determine the speed of each train:
- The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- The first train travels \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- The second train travels \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then determine how many people he helps.

First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days:
- Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Days he works = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he helps:
- People per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is 240."
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars, and then sum these two numbers.

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. Therefore, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00
3. Cost of the frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
4. Cost of the set of towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
5. Total cost of the frying pan and the set of towels: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
6. New balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.

We know that the number of jellyfish that change color is 6, which is equal to \( \frac{T}{15} \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and the percentage of her salary she plans to live on in retirement.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
- Lauren's current salary is $100,000.
- She saves 20% of her salary each year.
- Therefore, her annual savings are \( 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much she will need to save for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement:
- Her retirement salary will be \( 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \) dollars per year.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save for 20 years of retirement:
- The total amount needed for 20 years of retirement is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

Finally, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000, given that she saves $20,000 each year:
- The number of years needed to save $800,000 is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school by \( N \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = N - 240 = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Then, we determine the number of heels:
- Total number of heels: \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Finally, we calculate the average height of the heels:
- Average height: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we first need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike in June and then the number of miles she plans to hike in June.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She intends to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of days in June:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

Now, we determine the total number of miles she plans to hike in June:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since she needs to hike 9,300 miles and plans to hike 7,500 miles, the number of additional miles she needs to hike per day is:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person wants and then subtract that from the total amount of apples.

First, let's find out how much Pierre wants. Since Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Next, let's find out how much Paul wants. Paul wants one-third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want:
\[ \text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount wanted by Pierre and Paul from the original 12 kg to find out how many kilograms James will have left:

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) hours.

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) hours.
   - Let's assume Dior took 12 hours for laundry (a reasonable assumption given the problem's phrasing).

Now, we sum up the total time they all took to do their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker needs to produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys short of the order.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up the difference. The fifth worker needs to produce \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys needed by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received 9 stickers more than he kept, so \( \frac{S}{4} = 9 + 7 \).

Solving for \( S \):
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to first determine the speed of the second fastest car and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given:
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
- The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.

First, calculate the speed of the second fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the average car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, calculate the speed of the fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We know that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \), we get:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of each box (which includes both the crayons and the box itself) is:

\[ \text{Total weight of each box} = 8 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 8 \text{ ounces (box)} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to find the total weight of all the boxes. Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 16 \text{ ounces/box} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]

Let's confirm this with a Python code snippet.
```python
# Given values
total_crayons = 200
crayons_per_group = 8
weight_per_crayon = 1  # in ounces
weight_per_box = 8  # in ounces
ounces_per_pound = 16

# Calculate number of groups
number_of_groups = total_crayons // crayons_per_group

# Calculate weight of each box (crayons + box)
weight_per_box_total = crayons_per_group * weight_per_crayon + weight_per_box

# Calculate total weight in ounces
total_weight_ounces = number_of_groups * weight_per_box_total

# Convert total weight to pounds
total_weight_pounds = total_weight_ounces / ounces_per_pound

total_weight_pounds
```
```output
Done
```
The total weight of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound, is \(\boxed{25}\) pounds."
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to determine how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, if he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, we can solve for her brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

So, Valerie's brother earns $10000 per month.

Next, we calculate their mother's salary. The mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles per minute, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can break down the problem into parts and sum them up:

- 3 trees each had 7 blue birds: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 different trees each had 4 blue birds: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree had 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Adding these together gives the total number of blue birds:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water in his bottle from the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. After pouring, the temperature of the water in his bottle from the second mug is \( \frac{T}{5} \) degrees (since 1 ounce is poured from the 5-ounce mug).

The final temperature of the water in Donny's bottle is the weighted average of the temperatures of the water from both mugs. Since he poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, the final temperature \( F \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ F = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + T}{5} \]

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need to find the minimum temperature \( T \) such that the final temperature \( F \) is at least 40 degrees:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5 gives:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives:

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, given the initial number of animals and the daily additions.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added over three weeks:
- There are 20 cows added per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Therefore, the total number of cows added is \(20 \times 21 = 420\).

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added over three weeks:
- There are 10 chickens added per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Therefore, the total number of chickens added is \(10 \times 21 = 210\).

Now, let's find the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Cows added: 420
- Total cows: \(50 + 420 = 470\)

- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Chickens added: 210
- Total chickens: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total cows and total chickens:
- Total animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

The final numerical answer is:
700"
"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is the total cost after the discount divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

It is given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 3 less than 6 is 3, it means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we need to determine how many potatoes are equivalent to 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 3 potatoes, we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ scoops}}{3 \text{ potatoes}} = \frac{18 \text{ scoops}}{x \text{ potatoes}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{18 \times 3}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can now calculate the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - 17 - 34 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects from all his trees over a period of 10 years.

First, we know that Tim grows 5 trees and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. Therefore, the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year is 6.

Next, we calculate the number of lemons collected from all 5 trees in one year:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade (10 years):
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84, so we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold per day and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. So, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. If Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold per day as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:

\[
\text{Sunflowers from bouquets per day} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Next, we need to find out how many sunflowers were sold per day from the sunflower sales. Each sunflower costs $2, and Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:

\[
\text{Sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the sunflowers sold individually:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 84 + 13 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold per day by 3:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{291}

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue if Adam sells all 20 rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$140
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue if Adam only sells 60% of his inventory:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$84
   \]

4. **Calculate the loss:**
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = \$140 - \$84 = \$56
   \]

Therefore, Adam loses $56."
"To determine the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
  \]

Finally, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized picture scenes is:
  \[
  \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
  \]

To find the total number of days required to complete all the picture scenes, we sum the days for each type:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:

"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the probabilities for each ticket:
- The probability that the first ticket is a winner is \( P_1 = 0.20 \).
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket is a winner is \( P_2 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12. \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%. \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's start by determining how many seashells each person collected.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. Therefore, we can calculate the number of seashells Carlos collected as follows:
\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can calculate the number of seashells Carrey collected as follows:
\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:
\[ \text{Total seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are three people, each person gets:
\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, each person gets 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number he eats on weekends.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + (0.60 \times 5) \]

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

First, the selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price:
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
The total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Since he sold each of the 6 devices for $40, the total revenue is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus was able to earn is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how long Carl's cane is, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know Isabel's height and the relationships between the heights of Isabel, Ned, and Carl.

1. Isabel's height is 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed. Each bottle can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we know that Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \]

So, the number of additional bottles Hortex would have to produce is 7300. Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ \boxed{7300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to 1 for practical purposes)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is calculated by dividing the number of purple-wearers wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports - (Reports on Monday and Tuesday + Reports on Thursday and Friday)

Let's calculate it:

Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
Reports received on Wednesday = 5168 - 4043
Reports received on Wednesday = 1125

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of land Abraham initially owned.
2. Determine the area sold in the first transaction.
3. Determine the area sold in the second transaction.
4. Calculate the remaining area of land.
5. Determine the revenue from selling the remaining land.
6. Sum up the total revenue from all transactions.

Let's start with the initial area of land Abraham owned:
\[ \text{Initial area} = 80 \text{ square meters} \]

In the first transaction, Abraham sold half of his land:
\[ \text{Area sold in the first transaction} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]
\[ \text{Revenue from the first transaction} = 40 \times 50 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the first transaction, the remaining area of land is:
\[ \text{Remaining area after the first transaction} = 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

In the second transaction, Abraham sold 1/4 of the remaining land:
\[ \text{Area sold in the second transaction} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]
\[ \text{Revenue from the second transaction} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

After the second transaction, the remaining area of land is:
\[ \text{Remaining area after the second transaction} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

In the third transaction, Abraham sold the remaining land at $3 per square meter:
\[ \text{Revenue from the third transaction} = 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum up the total revenue from all transactions:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 2000 + 300 + 90 = 2390 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[ \boxed{2390} \]"
"To find Geb's age, we first need to calculate half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day. Since he changes his mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ masks/time} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days. Since he uses 6 masks in one day, in 2 days he will use:
\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate how many eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is \(200 + 200 = 400\).

Next, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex, which is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes:
- The combined total of the first two complexes is 400 apartments.
- 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, we find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
- The total number of apartments is \(400 + 640 = 1040\).

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment in each of the three complexes. Therefore, the total number of garbage collections per week is:
- \(1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per apartment} = 3120 \text{ collections}\).

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Thus, his total weekly earnings are:
- \(3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per collection} = 1248 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the blue rope is \( y - 7 \) centimeters. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4(y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ y = 12 \]

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ 4(y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, so:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Ronnie received $5, so the total amount of money Rissa had initially was $15.

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

So, we have:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister, so:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the total area of the house is the sum of the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house. The remaining area is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

Starting with Monday:
- Monday: 3 puffs

Tuesday:
- Double the number of puffs from Monday: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) puffs

Wednesday:
- Double the number of puffs from Tuesday: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) puffs

Thursday:
- Double the number of puffs from Wednesday: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) puffs

Friday:
- Double the number of puffs from Thursday: \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) puffs

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 12 puffs
- Thursday: 24 puffs
- Friday: 48 puffs

Total: \( 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \)

Let's add these numbers:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} \times 20\% = 100 \text{ pods} \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box also costs $12, so the cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cycles we can run with $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $0.10, $1 can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, with $1, we can run 10 cycles with the new box. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has $1200. Now, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final numerical answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's determine how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, and he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

There are 12 boys in the class. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of students not on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students} \]

The number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ 24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students} = 17 \text{ students} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we first need to determine how many face masks Mike bought, which is given as 5. Then we calculate how many face masks Johnny bought, which is 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as \( M \) and the number of face masks Johnny bought as \( J \).

Given:
\[ M = 5 \]

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, so:
\[ J = 3M + 2 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):
\[ J = 3(5) + 2 \]
\[ J = 15 + 2 \]
\[ J = 17 \]

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James has 30 teeth in total.

The dentist drills 4 teeth.
The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
50

"To determine the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased.
2. Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiry.
3. Calculate the refund amount based on the returned milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased.**

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of milk returned due to expiry.**

Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the refund amount.**

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the refund amount is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \)
2. \( C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \) and \( \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \)

Both equations are satisfied, so Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we can find out how many books each school gets by dividing the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ 1800 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1800 \]"

2. One of them landed on Newton's head. Now, Newton has 1 apple.
3. Newton picked up the 1 apple on his head and the other apple that fell out, making a total of 2 apples. He put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 5 apples.
4. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree. This caused 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 6 apples.
5. Newton picked up all of the remaining 6 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 6 apples. 

The final numerical answer is: 6"
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the cheese pizza = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from the pepperoni pizza = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Next, we determine how many whole pizzas are needed for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = Total slices eaten / Slices per pizza = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = Total slices eaten / Slices per pizza = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Since Kate needs to buy whole pizzas, and both the cheese and pepperoni pizzas require 3 pizzas, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 snowballs melt every hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay can make in an hour is:

\[ 20 - 2 = 18 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 18 \times \text{hours} = 60 \]

Solving for hours:

\[ \text{hours} = \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

So, it will take Jay approximately 3.33 hours to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3.33 \]"
"If John is 28 years old now, and when Digimon came out, he was twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's age at that time:

Let \( J_d \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out. Then John's age at that time was \( 2J_d \). Given that John is 28 now, we can say that the difference in their ages is constant over time. So, if John is 28 now, he was \( 28 - J_d \) years older than Jim when Digimon came out. This difference is equal to \( 2J_d - J_d = J_d \).

Therefore, \( 28 - J_d = J_d \), which simplifies to \( 28 = 2J_d \), and solving for \( J_d \) gives \( J_d = 14 \).

So, Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out. Since 20 years have passed since Digimon came out, Jim is now \( 14 + 20 = 34 \) years old.

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which means she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices. 

The total number of slices they all ate is 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - At the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 97\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means there is a discrepancy. Let's recheck the calculations:

- At the end of the second day, they had 22 bandages.
- They ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\) bandages.
- But the problem states they had 78 bandages left, which means there is an inconsistency. Let's assume the problem's statement is correct and re-evaluate the initial bandages.

Given that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can work backwards:

- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages.
- Before using 25 bandages, they had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages.
- Before ordering 100 bandages, they had \(103 - 100 = 3\) bandages.
- At the end of the second day, they had 22 bandages, so before using 28 bandages, they had \(22 + 28 = 50\) bandages.
- At the end of the first day, they had 50 bandages, so before ordering 50 bandages, they had \(50 - 50 = 0\) bandages.

Therefore, they started with 0 bandages on the first day.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the haircut was 2 inches long. The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost for the haircut is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30 \text{ per inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the hair color, which is $40. Therefore, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$100 \]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for the month. Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Therefore, her weekly hours are:

\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total hours for the month are:

\[ 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her regular pay for the month is:

\[ 180 \, \text{hours} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences for the month, she receives the additional $10 attendance bonus. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for each task, and then sum these amounts.

For doing laundry:
- Jason did laundry once, and he earns $3.00 for each laundry.
- So, he earned $3.00.

For cleaning his room:
- Jason cleaned his room once, and he earns $1.50 for each cleaning.
- So, he earned $1.50.

For taking the trash out:
- Jason took the trash out twice, and he earns $0.75 for each trip.
- So, he earned $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.

For emptying the dishwasher:
- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and he earns $0.50 for each time.
- So, he earned $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
- $3.00 (from laundry) + $1.50 (from cleaning his room) + $1.50 (from taking the trash) + $3.00 (from emptying the dishwasher) = $9.00.

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two week period."
"First, let's determine the amount of blood in a single shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum all these numbers to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"Let's denote the cost per bottle of scotch as \( x \) dollars. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so we can write the equation:

\[ 10x = 600 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \]

So, each bottle of scotch costs $60. Now, let's consider the bottles of cognac. John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) bottles of cognac. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]

Now, we can find the total amount John spends on everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To find out how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer that was left after all the losses and spills.

Starting with 24 gallons:

- On the first day, 4 gallons were drunk by Fred's children, so we subtract 4 gallons: \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons.
- On the second day, 7 gallons were accidentally spilled by Barbie, so we subtract 7 gallons: \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons.
- On the third day, 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so we subtract 5 gallons: \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and the remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among them. Therefore, each person would get:

\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
\]

To express this as a decimal, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Total number of fish = 66.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22\).

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish:**
   - Total number of fish = 66.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22.
   - Remaining fish = \(66 - 22 = 44\).

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Remaining fish = 44.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \(\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20\).

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = 20.

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. Therefore, Amy loses four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up three colors. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of shells found by each team.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the average distance walked per day by all dogs.

The total distance walked by the first three dogs is:
1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles

The average distance walked per day by all four dogs is 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance walked by all four dogs is:
4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:
12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day. Over 3 days, it removes \(1 \times 3 = 3\) liters.
- On the medium setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day. Over 3 days, it removes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) liters.
- On the high setting, the dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day. Over 5 days, it removes \(4 \times 5 = 20\) liters.

Now, we sum up the total amount of water removed over the entire period:

\[3 \text{ liters (low setting)} + 6 \text{ liters (medium setting)} + 20 \text{ liters (high setting)} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is 29 liters."

So, the total amount of medicine in one dose is:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest, and then determine how much he will pay each month and the remaining amount for the twelfth month.

1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen will owe:**
   - Stephen borrowed $300.
   - He promised to return it with an additional 2% interest.
   - The interest amount is \( 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total amount Stephen will owe is \( 300 + 6 = 306 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total amount Stephen will pay over 11 months:**
   - Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months.
   - The total amount paid over 11 months is \( 25 \times 11 = 275 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:**
   - The total amount Stephen owes is $306.
   - The total amount he will have paid by the end of the eleventh month is $275.

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diaper changes required per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:

\[ 5 \text{ (diaper changes per child)} \times 2 \text{ (children)} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

This means that the remaining half of the diaper changes are made by Jordan. Therefore, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

"To solve this, we need to calculate the volume of the jar, the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar, and then determine how many of those are red.

First, calculate the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar considering the packing efficiency:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume of the jar}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} \times \text{Efficiency} = \frac{540}{0.15} \times 0.8 = 3600 \times 0.8 = 2880 \]

Now, calculate the number of red jelly beans:
\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.3 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. Therefore, the difference between the estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number is:

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into steps.

First, calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it has increased by 150%. The increase in cost is calculated as follows:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \]
So, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for the first 5 years. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years, she makes:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits} \]
The total cost for these 15 visits is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

Then, calculate the total cost for the next 3 years. In these 3 years, she makes:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]
The total cost for these 9 visits is:
\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \]

Finally, add the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years to find the total amount spent:
\[ 75 + 45 = 120 \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece will be \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), which is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]
(There are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is 10.)

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify this:
If \( C = 3 \), then \( B = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \).
The total number of treats is \( 3 + 7 = 10 \), which matches the problem statement.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these two costs together to find the total cost of both services without any discounts or additional charges:

\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, the salon offers a 20% discount if both services are purchased together. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the discounted price for both services:

\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art service costs $3:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price of the toy in November was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

\[ \text{Increase in December} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

In January, the price decreased by 50% from the December price. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

\[ \text{Decrease in January} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 50 \times 24 \times 3 \, \text{km} \]

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 \]

1. **Grapes Madeline ate**: 6 grapes.
2. **Grapes used by her brother**: 5 times the number of grapes Madeline ate. Therefore, her brother used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. **Grapes remaining after her brother**: The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is \(x - 36\), where \(x\) is the total number of grapes at the beginning.
4. **Grapes used for pies**: The remaining grapes were used to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used for pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. **Setting up the equation**: The number of grapes remaining after her brother used his grapes is equal to the number of grapes used for the pies. So, we have:
   \[
   x - 36 = 48
   \]
6. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = 48 + 36 = 84
   \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate this:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9 = 79 + 9 = 88

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, we add these costs together to find the total weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the annual cost is:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{520} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours since the workday is measured in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage is not realistic in the context of a workday, as it exceeds 100%. This result indicates that the custodian spends more than one full workday cleaning the school, which is not possible within the given constraints. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 250\% \]"
"Let's break down the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \text{Total capacity of one bookcase} = 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \text{Number of bookcases needed} = \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. 

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal 60 eggs.

Now, let's determine how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. 

To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:

60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since each set is sold for $1, the total earnings from selling all the eggs will be:

Total earnings = 20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost
Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit is $8.00."
"To find out how many white hats Skyler has, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Skyler has a total of 100 hats. Half of these hats are red, so the number of red hats is:
\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

After accounting for the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:
\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Next, we are told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:
\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:
\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since the bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey got 60% of them correct. We calculate the number of correct answers on the first test as follows:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to correctly answer:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions in total to pass.

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the first equation to find \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year for four years. Therefore, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, since her score for every game is 21 points, the total number of points she has scored is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ \boxed{3360} \]"
"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. After searching, he found 3 marbles, so he had 3 marbles plus the 5 he didn't lose, making a total of 3 + 5 = 8 marbles. However, one of the marbles he found was actually a bead, so he discarded that. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the requirement).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs \( 8 \times 25 = 200 \) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is:
200"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for the people) + 16 (for the rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.
- Therefore, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:
- Total number of flashlights and candles = 20 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 56.

The final numerical answer is 56."

If Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, then there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to convert Tim's daily work hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls Tim can handle in a day. Given that it takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by the number of days in the week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish."
"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left. Crista has 20 plants in total, and we've accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. So, the remaining number of plants is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends hopping and swimming.

Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards. Half of this distance is on land, and the other half is in water. Therefore, he will hop 100 yards and swim 100 yards.

The time taken to hop 100 yards at a speed of 20 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time hopping} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

The time taken to swim 100 yards at a speed of 10 yards per minute is:
\[ \text{Time swimming} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time taken for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time spent hopping and the time spent swimming:

"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Now, we multiply the number of doughnuts made per day by the number of days in June:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the number of people Conor saw on the first day:
\[ \text{First day} = 50 \]

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day:
\[ \text{Second day} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day:
\[ \text{Third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people seen each day over the week is 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week is:
\[ 5 \times 60 = 300 \]

The total number of people seen over the week can also be expressed as the sum of the people seen on each day:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 300 \]
\[ 260 + 3x = 300 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 300 - 260 \]
\[ 3x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \]

However, since the number of people must be a whole number, we can conclude that the value of \( x \) is indeed 13.33, but for the purpose of calculating the total number of people seen, we use the sum directly:
\[ 260 + 3 \times 13.33 = 260 + 40 = 300 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the previous rate, so \(60 \times 4 = 240\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves the previous rate, so \(240 \div 2 = 120\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat. The number of kernels that pop due to residual heat is:
\[120 \div 4 = 30\]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[440 + 30 = 470\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[470\]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade:

Next, determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart:
\[ 1 \text{ cup} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon to the lemon juice needed for the other 3 gallons:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the total number of lemons needed is:
\[ 6 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to find out how much food the German Shepherds and Bulldogs consume daily, and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

For the German Shepherds:
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- So, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- So, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds:
- Total daily consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day \(\times\) 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

The farm has 10 animals with 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

The farm also has 15 animals with 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs on the farm:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then determine the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciates 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

Pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
Pink candies = 232 - 189
Pink candies = 43

The final numerical answer is 43."
"To calculate the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel stay is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus travels:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- The cost of one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the hotel and bus travels:
- Total cost for the hotel stay: $240
- Total cost for the bus travels: $56
- Therefore, the total cost for the trip is \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

The cost of the popcorns is:
2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:
Total cost = Cost of adult tickets + Cost of child ticket + Cost of popcorns
Total cost = $24 + $8 + $6 = $38

So, the family pays a total of $38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds. Adding these together gives the total weight:

\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over a week and then subtract that from the initial amount of feed he ordered.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Dexter has five pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds per pig per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over a week (7 days), the total feed consumption is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the end of the third street, there are 30 children following the truck. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group, so the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final number of children following the truck is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the total number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she planned to distribute.

First, let's calculate the total number of meals given out:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's add these numbers:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the time spent each day and then multiply by the number of days in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation in the morning: 15 minutes
- Meditation before sleep: 15 minutes
- Total meditation time per day: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each day:
- Yoga practice: 1 hour (60 minutes)

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga each day:
- Total daily practice time: 30 (meditation) + 60 (yoga) = 90 minutes

Since Charisma practices 5 days a week, we calculate the weekly practice time:
- Weekly practice time: 90 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 450 minutes/week

Finally, we calculate the total practice time over 4 weeks:
- Total practice time over 4 weeks: 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Total practice time over 4 weeks in hours: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
11 small t-shirts * 3 square feet per small t-shirt = 33 square feet

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the 36 seeds of the small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

Next, we calculate the total revenue. The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is \(70000 \times 2 = 140000\).

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys two T-shirts and the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt is at full price and the second T-shirt is at half price.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.

So, the price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
Total amount = $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one jar is:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
$50 * 10 = $500

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
$500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time and then determine how long it takes to fill them all.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug by the dog = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day at night. The net change in the number of holes per day is:
- Net change per day = 6 holes dug - 9 holes filled = -3 holes.

This means that every day, the number of holes decreases by 3. We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes.

Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes. The total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is:
\[ 9d \]

We set this equal to the total number of holes dug:
\[ 9d = 84 \]
\[ d = \frac{84}{9} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \text{ days} \]

Since the dog continues to dig holes at a rate of 6 holes per day during this period, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug during these 9.33 days:
\[ 6 \times 9.33 \approx 56 \text{ holes} \]

The number of holes left to be filled after 9.33 days is:
\[ 84 - 56 = 28 \text{ holes} \]

Now, we need to calculate how many more days it takes to fill the remaining 28 holes at a rate of 9 holes per day:
\[ \text{Additional days} = \frac{28}{9} \approx 3.11 \text{ days} \]

Adding the initial 9.33 days to the additional 3.11 days gives us the total time in days:
\[ 9.33 + 3.11 \approx 12.44 \text{ days} \]

To convert this into weeks, we divide by 7:
\[ \frac{12.44}{7} \approx 1.78 \text{ weeks} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, it takes approximately 2 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given:

First, calculate Butler High School's average enrollment:
\[
\text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \text{ students}
\]

Next, find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:
\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \text{ students}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: Half as many as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Petri dishes: Two more than the number requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- Beakers: The correct number, which is 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

The total number of items gathered is:
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Let's calculate the total:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times \text{Time Aaron took} = A \times 16 \]

Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \). Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute and he took 16 minutes, we have:

\[ D_A = A \times 16 \]

Since Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, the total distance they ran together is the sum of the distances each ran. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \) and the distance Vanessa ran as \( D_V \). We know that:

\[ D_A + D_V = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we have:

\[ D_V = 4 \]

So,

\[ D_A + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Since \( D_A = A \times 16 \), we can substitute \( D_A \) in the equation:

\[ A \times 16 + 4 = \text{Total distance of the race} \]

Now, we need to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race. Since Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute and she ran 4 miles, the time she took to complete her part of the race is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{D_V}{V} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We know that \( A = 2V \), so \( V = \frac{A}{2} \). Substituting \( V \) in the time equation:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{\frac{A}{2}} = \frac{4 \times 2}{A} = \frac{8}{A} \]

Since \( A = 2V \), we can substitute \( A \) back:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{8}{2V} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We need to find the value of \( V \). Since \( A = 2V \) and \( D_A = A \times 16 = 2V \times 16 = 32V \), the total distance of the race is:

\[ D_A + D_V = 32V + 4 \]

Since \( D_A = 32V \) and \( D_V = 4 \), the total distance is:

\[ 32V + 4 = 32V + 4 \]

This confirms the distances. Now, we need to find the time Vanessa took. Since \( V = \frac{A}{2} \) and \( A = 2V \), we can use the fact that the total time for the race is the sum of the times taken by Aaron and Vanessa. Let's denote the total time for the race as \( T \). Since Aaron took 16 minutes and the total distance is \( 32V + 4 \), we can find \( V \) by noting that the total time \( T \) is the sum of the times taken by Aaron and Vanessa. Since the total distance is \( 32V + 4 \) and the total time is the sum of the times taken by Aaron and Vanessa, we can find that Vanessa's time is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{V} = \frac{4}{\frac{A}{2}} = \frac{8}{A} = \frac{8}{2V} = \frac{4}{V} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 4 minutes to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the current dock length.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There is currently 200 feet of dock.

First, we calculate the total line needed for the current dock length:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the 6 feet of new line that the caretaker already has:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line needed} - 6 \text{ feet of line already have} = 594 \text{ feet of line to buy} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total revenue per night and then multiply by the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost per night:
- 2 meals at $5 each: 2 * $5 = $10
- 1 bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per night: $10 + $5 = $15

Now, we know that the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, but the cost per night is $15, so we need to find out how much they make per reservation:
- $15 / 6 reservations = $2.50 per reservation

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we can calculate the weekly revenue:
- $2.50 per reservation * 6 reservations per night * 2 nights per week = $30 per week

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $30."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine James's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 9 years old.
   - James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

2. **Determine the current age of John:**
   - John had James when he was 19, so John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

3. **Determine the current age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and Ana spends 3 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in one hour. Since Jane spends 4 minutes peeling each orange, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
\[ 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. 

The discount amount is 80% of $400, which is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. The cost for the mechanic's labor is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of the mechanic's labor:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. Let's confirm this by checking the total number of legs:
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- The total number of legs is \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given information.

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
