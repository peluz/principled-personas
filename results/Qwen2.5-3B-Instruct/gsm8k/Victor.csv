"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells. We start by noting the total number of eggs laid per day and subtract the number of eggs she eats and uses for baking.

1. Total eggs laid per day: 16
2. Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
3. Eggs used for baking: 4

First, we calculate the number of eggs remaining after Janet's consumption and use for baking:
\[ 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 \]

These 9 eggs are the ones she sells at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the total amount she makes every day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the amount of white fiber required for the robe. Since the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, and we know that it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, we can calculate the white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we add the blue and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts required:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
Total bolts = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required is 3."
"First, let's calculate the increased value of the house after Josh's repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $80,000:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value of the house gives us the new value:

\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the house is now worth $200,000. Josh spent a total of $80,000 (original price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000 to buy and repair the house. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:

\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total meters James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for one sprint:**
   James runs 3 sprints each week, so the total meters for one sprint in a week is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 180 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total meters James runs in one week for all sprints:**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each week, the total meters he runs in a week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed she gives her flock in the morning and afternoon.

Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens. She gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total feed in morning} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]
\[
\text{Total feed in afternoon} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Adding the morning and afternoon feed together:

\[
\text{Total feed in morning and afternoon} = 60 \text{ cups} + 60 \text{ cups} = 120 \text{ cups}
\]

Wendi feeds her chickens a total of 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. Therefore, the amount of feed given in the final meal of the day is:

\[
\text{Total feed} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

Since the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 120 cups, the remaining amount of feed for the final meal is:

\[
\text{Feed for final meal} = 120 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 80 \text{ cups}
\]

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break down the cost for 16 glasses:

- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs $3.
- And so on...

This pattern continues for 16 glasses. We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost is 8 pairs times $8 per pair.

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of sheep in each city based on the given relationships and the number of sheep in Seattle.

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is:
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[
160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

Thus, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time taken for each part of the download.

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update installation:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The remaining 60% of the file is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Time for the first 40% + Time for the update + Time for the restart = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 0 mph (due to traffic)
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time: 3.5 hours
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance: \(3.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 280 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum up the distances from each segment to find the total distance traveled:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 280 \text{ miles} = 475 \text{ miles}\]

Since John started 180 miles from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[475 \text{ miles} - 180 \text{ miles} = 295 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[295\]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

For the overtime hours, she works 5 hours over the 40-hour limit. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]
So, her earnings for the 5 overtime hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Adding the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours gives us her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{First month downloads} = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of downloads in the second month, which is three times the number of downloads in the first month:
\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Then, we calculate the number of downloads in the third month, which is 70% of the downloads in the second month (since it reduced by 30%):
\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

Now, we sum the downloads from all three months to find the total number of downloads:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen costs $68.
- Therefore, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen costs $80.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen costs $55.
- Therefore, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
- The total cost is \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost is 694 dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which this profit becomes positive.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
- Each year, the lemon tree produces 7 lemons.
- Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
- Therefore, the annual revenue from lemons is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree:
- The cost to water and feed the tree is $3 per year.

Now, we can determine the net profit each year:
- Net profit per year = Annual revenue from lemons - Annual cost of maintenance
- Net profit per year = \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Since the initial cost to plant the tree is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost.

Let \(n\) be the number of years it takes to earn back the initial cost. The total net profit after \(n\) years is \(7.5n\). We need this to be at least $90:
\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):
\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree. The final numerical answer is:

12"
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

First, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

Next, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.

According to the problem, after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3:

\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"To solve this, let's break down the numbers:

1. **Contemporary Dance Enrollment:**
   - 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. **Remaining Students After Contemporary Dance:**
   - 20 - 4 = 16 students

3. **Jazz Dance Enrollment:**
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. **Remaining Students After Jazz Dance:**
   - 16 - 4 = 12 students

5. **Hip-Hop Dance Enrollment:**
   - The rest enrolled in hip-hop dance, which is 12 students.

6. **Percentage of Students Enrolled in Hip-Hop Dance:**
   - To find the percentage of the entire class, we use the formula: (Number of students in hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100
   - (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine the merchant's profit, we need to calculate the value of the jewelry and the electronic gadgets after the respective market increases, and then compare the two.

First, let's calculate the value of the jewelry after a 2.5% increase:
\[
\text{Value of jewelry after increase} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
\]

Next, let's calculate the value of the electronic gadgets after a 1.2% increase:
\[
\text{Value of electronic gadgets after increase} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096
\]

Now, we compare the two values to determine which purchase would maximize profit:
- If the merchant buys the jewelry, the value after the increase is $5125.
- If the merchant buys the electronic gadgets, the value after the increase is $8096.

The difference in value between the electronic gadgets and the jewelry is:
\[
8096 - 5125 = 2971
\]

Therefore, the merchant would maximize profit by choosing to buy the electronic gadgets, and the profit would be:
\[
\boxed{2971}
\]"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction.

First, the distance traveled westward is 80 miles.
Second, the distance traveled northward is 150 miles.

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Finally, we sum up her annual teaching and coaching earnings to get her total annual salary.

Let's do the math:

Annual teaching earnings = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Annual coaching earnings = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To solve this problem, I'll first determine how many eggs Claire uses in a week, and then multiply that by 4 to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks. Finally, I'll convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

In 4 weeks, she will use 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks is 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we need to determine the total time she should take to cover the entire distance.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over the 12-mile trail, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, which totals 2 hours. Therefore, the remaining time she needs to cover the remaining distance is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Thus, the required speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

For the orange drink:
- It is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

For the pineapple drink:
- It is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

After adding the orange drink and the pineapple drink, we have a total of 24 liters of mixture. However, we spill one liter of the orange drink, so we only have 9 liters of orange drink left.

The total amount of water in the mixture is the sum of the water from the orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Water from the orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters.
- Water from the pineapple drink: 9 liters.

Adding these together gives:
\[ \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \] liters of water.

Since we have 24 liters of the mixture, the fraction of water in the mixture is:
\[ \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{24} = \frac{47}{72} \] of the total mixture.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{47}{72} = \frac{24 \times 47}{72} = \frac{47}{3} = 15.6667 \approx 15.67 \] liters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15.67} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Raymond's age when he had his son and then calculate how many years ago that was.

First, we know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Since Samantha is now 31, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago (23 - 25 = -2, but we take the absolute value since we're looking for the time elapsed).

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. 

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by customer group:

- The last 3 customers do not buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 7."
"The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. Given that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length over 4 hours would be:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information given. If the book was bought for $19.50 with a 25% discount, then $19.50 represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \). Then we have:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( P \).
```python
# Calculation
original_price = 19.50 / 0.75
original_price
```
```output
RuntimeError
```
It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let me perform the calculation manually:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \$26.00 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.

The cost of 5 packs of milk is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

The cost of 4 apples is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \]

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50. If we subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total amount paid, we can find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum them up.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50 per pair = $59.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42 per pair = $126.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
$59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent $253.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she will consume and then determine the cost based on the number of cartons she will need to buy.

First, we calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days:
\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points on his trip.

Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles. His first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means his second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

The distance traveled between his first and second stops is the difference between the distance of his second stop and the distance of his first stop. Therefore, the distance traveled is 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

The final numerical answer is 25."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

Next, we need to find Allen's age 10 years from now. Adding 10 years to Allen's current age, we get:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

\[\boxed{109}\]"
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. Therefore, the total time spent on one dog per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on all dogs in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 35 hours a week."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. Let's denote the number of jewels Raymond has as \( R \). So, \( R = 40 \).

Next, we know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Let's denote the number of jewels Aaron has as \( A \). Therefore, we can write the relationship as:
\[ A = \frac{R}{2} + 5 \]
Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ A = \frac{40}{2} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]
So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as \( S \). Therefore, we can write the relationship as:
\[ S = A - 2 \]
Substituting the value of \( A \):
\[ S = 25 - 2 = 23 \]
So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, 25% more points is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]
Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 5 points.

Adding the points from both periods, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

The total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the cost of one yogurt. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, one yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he will eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

The total cost for 60 yogurts is 60 * $1.25 = $75.00.

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we know that after buying the video games, John has $5 left. Therefore, we can find out how much money he spent on the video games and the lego sets combined by subtracting the remaining $5 from the total amount of money he made from selling the lego sets.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 190 \text{ dollars}
\]

We already know that he spent $160 on the video games. So, we can find out how much he spent on the lego sets by subtracting the cost of the video games from the total amount spent.

\[
190 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since he sold all 13 lego sets and made $195, and he spent $160 on video games, he has $30 left from the lego sales. This means he has 13 lego sets initially and has not sold any of them yet.

Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and divide it by the total time he spends running.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days, with the first day being 3 hours and the other two days being half as much, which is 1.5 hours each.

So, the total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Dana can travel in six hours given her running, walking, and skipping speeds, and the time she spends on each activity.

First, let's find Dana's walking speed. We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and this speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, the time spent running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance Dana can travel by running and walking. The distance she can run in 2 hours at 6 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
The distance she can walk in 4 hours at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 16 \text{ miles} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To find the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Given:
- Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
- With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

Therefore, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones cut a total of 5 pies into 8 pieces each, so the total number of pieces was:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

The final numerical answer is 26."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the number of calories in a single serving of the bag of chips. Given that a 300g bag has 5 servings, we can calculate the calories per serving as follows:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calories are left for the day. Since the daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips can be consumed with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips that can be consumed is:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total cost of making the candles and the total revenue from selling them, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of making the candles. Charlie needs 20 candles, and each candle requires 1/10 of a pound of beeswax (since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles). Therefore, for 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00 \]

Additionally, the cost of the wicks is \$10.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the candles. If Charlie sells each candle for \$2.00 and he makes 20 candles, the total revenue is:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$30.00 = \$10.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write each article.

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).
3. After purchasing the package, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used \( x \) post-it notes from the package.
4. After placing the post-it notes on the coffee cups and using the initial 80 post-it notes, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x - 140 = 23 \]

Adding 140 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. Given that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the total length of the wire in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we first need to calculate the total number of units in the building.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units in the building is:
\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to determine how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how many eggs Lloyd's chickens produce in a day and then in a week.

Eggs produced per day: 252 eggs

Eggs produced per week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs this is. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen:

Dozens of eggs per week: 1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week

Now, we calculate how much Lloyd makes from selling these eggs at $2 per dozen:

Earnings per week: 147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back from his destination. We know that he travels back at a rate of 6 mph. However, we do not know the distance he traveled to get to his destination. Let's denote the distance to his destination as \(D\) miles.

The time it takes to travel a distance \(D\) at a speed of 10 mph is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

The time it takes to travel the same distance \(D\) at a speed of 6 mph is given by:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

Since the distance \(D\) is the same in both scenarios, we can equate the two expressions for time. However, we are not given the distance \(D\), so we cannot directly calculate the time for the return trip without it. 

But if we assume that the distance \(D\) is the same for both the outbound and return trips, and we are only asked for the time it takes to return, we can use the speed of 6 mph directly.

So, the time it takes to get back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{6} \]

Since the distance \(D\) is not specified, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume that the distance \(D\) is known or can be calculated, the time to return would be \(\frac{D}{6}\) hours.

If we were to assume a specific distance, for example, if the distance \(D\) was 12 miles (which is a common example in such problems), then the time to return would be:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not specify the distance, the general answer in terms of \(D\) is:
\[ \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

If we assume \(D = 12\) miles, the answer would be:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not specify the distance, I will provide the general answer:
\[ \boxed{\frac{D}{6}} \]

If we assume \(D = 12\) miles, the specific answer would be:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 of them.

\[ \text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds in comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight to be removed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds.

\[ \text{Number of toys to be removed} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the difference in revenue between the days, I will first calculate the total revenue for Thursday and then for Friday, and finally find the difference.

For Thursday:
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each costing $60, so the revenue from truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tires is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- The total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

For Friday:
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each costing $40, so the revenue from car tires is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is $0.
- The total revenue for Friday is \(0 + 480 = 480\) dollars.

Now, to find the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday:
- The difference is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

The day with higher revenue is Thursday, and the difference in revenue is 40 dollars. Thus, the final numerical answer is:

40"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has.

First, we know that the two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. According to the information given, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens from the local animal shelter are 7, we can calculate the number of kittens Patchy has had as follows:

\[ \text{Number of kittens Patchy has had} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens Patchy has had:

\[ \text{Total number of kittens from adopted cats} = 7 + 21 = 28 \]

Then, we add the number of kittens Trixie has had:

\[ \text{Total number of kittens} = 28 + 12 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. If she packages 2 lollipops in one bag, the number of bags she can fill is 28 / 2 = 14 bags.

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one visit. 

The cost of a movie ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one visit is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one visit:
\[ \frac{42}{14} = 3 \]

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum additional weight that can be added to the truck is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be added, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Since 83 is a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{83} \]"
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the delivery fee and the tip added to the original bill.

The original bill was $40.00. The delivery vendor added a 25% fee to the original total, and then charged an additional $3.00 in delivery fees. Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.

First, calculate the 25% delivery fee on the original bill:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

Next, add the delivery fee and the tip to the original bill:
\[ 40.00 + 10.00 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after including the delivery fee and the tip, is:

"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of raspberries scattered across the bush.

There are 6 clusters, each with 20 raspberries, so the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Additionally, there are 67 raspberries scattered across the bush.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

"To solve this, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- One orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Next, we know there are 2 sour oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges are either bad, unripe, or sour:
\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \]

Since the total number of oranges is 25, the number of oranges that are good is:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the brooch before insurance:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, the final numerical answer is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service, we need to break down the calculation into two parts: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives a pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Total pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000.

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - 5% of $1,000,000 = 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is $50,000 per year.

3. **Total pension for 30 years:**
   - The total pension for the first 20 years is $1,000,000.
   - The total pension for the next 10 years is $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000.
   - Total pension for 30 years = $1,000,000 + $500,000 = $1,500,000.

4. **Annual pension for the last 10 years:**
   - Since she quits after 30 years, her annual pension for the last 10 years is the same as the pension she would have received if she had continued working, which is $50,000 per year.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year. Since there are 6 months in a half-year, and the service charges $140 per month, the cost for the first half of the year is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The service charges 10% less than the initial amount for the second half of the year. Therefore, the monthly charge for the second half is:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]
So, the cost for the second half of the year is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs of the two halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine how much gas she has left in her tank after her 100-mile trip. 

Given that her tank holds 12 gallons and she has used 4 gallons, she has \(12 - 4 = 8\) gallons left in her tank.

Since she has already driven 100 miles on 4 gallons, we can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) her car gets. 

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons, we multiply the number of gallons by the miles per gallon:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 12 \text{ gallons} \times 25 \text{ mpg} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's determine how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in one session.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, in one session, Jim spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jim repeats this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

We need to find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks. Therefore, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the players and coaches from both the girls' and boys' teams.

Each school has:
- 5 players on the girls' team
- 5 players on the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school sends:
\[ 5 \text{ (girls' players)} + 5 \text{ (boys' players)} + 1 \text{ (girls' coach)} + 1 \text{ (boys' coach)} = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are four schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \text{ (schools)} \times 12 \text{ (people per school)} = 48 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \]"

"Let's denote the number of girls as \( G \) and the number of boys as \( B \). According to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls, so we can write:

\[ B = 2G \]

Given that there are 60 girls, we substitute \( G \) with 60:

\[ B = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

So, there are 120 boys at the school. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:

\[ \text{Total students} = B + G = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

The problem states that there are 5 students to every teacher. Therefore, the number of teachers \( T \) can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by 5:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Total students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Thus, the number of teachers is 36."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we first need to calculate how much she received in her weekly allowance over the 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so her total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes her initial amount of money plus the $40 she received in allowances. Let's denote her initial amount of money as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- Judy teaches 5 classes every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
  \[
  5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}
  \]
- Judy also teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
  \[
  25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students.
  \[
  33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy makes in a week:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
  \[
  495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, Tommy raises $221 in total."
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to first determine the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that by 3.

The cost of one cell phone is $150. Shiela bought five cell phones, so the total cost before interest is:
\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

Next, we calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and Shiela bought five units, so the total interest is:
\[ 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

Adding the interest to the total cost gives us the total amount Shiela will pay:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Since this total amount is to be paid over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"To calculate the total amount Artie will make, we first need to round each flower's price to the nearest dollar and then multiply by the number of pots sold.

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Now, we calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 per pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 per pot = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Finally, we add up the totals:

$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, Artie will make $88.00."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, Level 3 has \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet.
- Level 2: Level 2 has half the square footage of Level 3, so it has \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet.
- Level 1: Level 1 has half the square footage of Level 2, so it has \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level: 16, 8, 4, and 2.

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum these values and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is 7.5."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then for the rest of the puppy's life within the first year.

First, we calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
  \[
  180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how much dog food the puppy will consume in the remaining days of the first year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days remaining after the first 180 days is:
\[
365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days}
\]

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day:
\[
185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, we add the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:
\[
180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
\]

Finally, we determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Each bag contains 110 cups:
\[
\frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}
\]

Thus, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, and then find the difference between the two.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry David does as follows:
\[
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does as follows:
\[
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[
\boxed{100}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price and then compare it to the cost of buying the same number of flowers at the other price.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Since each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50, we need to find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers.
- Number of packages needed = 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- Total cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each:
- Since each package of 2 flowers costs $1, we need to find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers.
- Number of packages needed = 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- Total cost = 9 * $1 = $9.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each = $15.
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each = $9.

The better price is buying the flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each. Therefore, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is:
- $15 - $9 = $6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To calculate the cost after the discount, we first need to determine the amount of the discount. The original cost is $100, and the discount is 30%. 

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 30 \]

Subtracting the discount amount from the original cost gives us the final cost:
\[ \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = 70 \]

So, the cost after the discount is $70."

"Let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Also, the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

2. **Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed in the company for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for the 10% increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**: 
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**: 
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for Each Subsequent Year**: 
   - After the second year, the salary will again increase by 10% of the new salary.
   - After the third year, the salary will again increase by 10% of the new salary.

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, we can solve for Corey's age using the third relationship:
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now, using the second relationship, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Finally, using the first relationship, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ J = A - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Lee's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee runs it two seconds faster than Gerald's new time after his diet change. Given that Lee's new time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's new time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Lee's new time} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast Gerald was running before his diet change. Since his new time is 10% faster than his original time, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.9 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

To find Gerald's original time, we divide 40 by 0.9:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \frac{40}{0.9} = \frac{400}{9} \approx 44.44 \text{ seconds} \]

   - Original volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes.
   - To find out how many 16 ounce cans are needed to make 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume by the volume of one can.
   - Number of 16 ounce cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
   - Since each can contains three tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
   - Total number of tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, and 5 cars took an exit. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30.

So, the equation representing the situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 15 \)."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

She receives 18 more potted plants from her nursery, so the total number of potted plants she has now is:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. This means she will give away:
\[ 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

The final numerical answer is 58."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Let's denote the number of times the fourth friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_4 \). So, \( F_4 = 60 \).

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Let's denote the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_3 \). Therefore, \( F_3 = F_4 + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 \).

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. Let's denote the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell as \( F_1 \). So, \( F_1 = 20 \). The second friend pressed the doorbell \( F_2 = F_1 + \frac{1}{4}F_1 = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \).

Now, we can sum up all the doorbell presses:
- First friend: \( F_1 = 20 \)
- Second friend: \( F_2 = 25 \)
- Third friend: \( F_3 = 70 \)
- Fourth friend: \( F_4 = 60 \)

The total number of doorbell presses is:
\[ F_1 + F_2 + F_3 + F_4 = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

John drinks one glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he drinks:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ glass/day} = 5 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks one glass of water with dinner. There are 2 days in the weekend, so he drinks:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ glass/day} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water he drinks on weekdays and weekends, we get:
\[ 5 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 7 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ 7 \]"

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of pieces**: 1000 pieces.

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: A quarter of the total pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: A third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner volume of a single box and then multiply it by 3.

Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of each box are:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 * 1 inch = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

The inner volume of one box is therefore:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 such boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ cubic inches} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 108 \]"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the hours:
1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the difference between the total hours he watched and the hours we've calculated is the number of hours he watched on Wednesday:
7 - 6 = 1 hour

Since he watched 1 hour on Wednesday, and each episode is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), he must have watched:
1 / 0.5 = 2 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake as \( x \). According to the problem, he actually baked twice as many as he intended, plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We are told that after dropping 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies. Since he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more, we can verify:
\[ 2 \times 50 + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115 \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he has:
\[ 115 - 5 = 110 \]

This confirms that the number of cookies Henry baked last year is indeed 50. Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards, we first need to calculate the total cost before the cashback. The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Subtracting the total cashback from the total cost before cashback gives us the final cost:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is \$28.00."
"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total: \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups

Beatrice's fruit roll-ups:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total: \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups

Next, we add the total number of roll-ups they each had:
- Total roll-ups: \(42 + 48 = 90\)

Since they both ate their entire amount, the average number of roll-ups they ate is:
- Average: \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\)

Thus, the final numerical answer is 45."
"First, let's determine the speed at which Julia rows the boat. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 80}{10} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[ 16 \text{ liters} \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

"Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This gives us the equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

We are also told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 50D \]
Since we already know \( B = 300 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $10.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- Each board cost her $16.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total cost of the lumber Sasha bought is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $10.
- Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 of these boards.
- She sells each board for the same price as when she bought them, which is $16.
- Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
- Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we can set up a proportion based on the ratio:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Here, \(x\) represents the number of teaspoons of sugar. Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine Adrien's salary four years ago. According to the problem, Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \). Therefore, we can write the equation for Adrien's salary as:
\[ 40,000 = L \times 1.30 \]
Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]
So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% from his original salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
\[ 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary four years later is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \]

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's salaries:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we need to calculate the hours she slept each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. Therefore, she slept:
- 8 - 2 = 6 hours on Tuesday
- 6 - 2 = 4 hours on Wednesday

For Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, she slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, she slept:
- 6 + 1 = 7 hours on Thursday
- 4 + 1 = 5 hours on Friday
- 5 + 1 = 6 hours on Saturday

Now, we sum up the hours she slept each day:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours

"First, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. The remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two periods:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were already stamped when Jennie began her work.

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters, which means she stamps 20 letters (since 60 divided by 3 equals 20).

After stamping 20 letters, there are 40 letters still needing stamps. We are told that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is the difference between the 30 letters now stamped and the 20 letters she stamped herself.

Therefore, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is 30 - 20 = 10.

The final numerical answer is 10."
"Let's denote the number of spoons Julia originally bought as \( x \).

Julia used 3 spoons while making the stew, so she had \( x - 3 \) spoons left.

Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she then had \( x - 3 + 5 = x + 2 \) spoons.

When Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

"To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first determine the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost for the quantities he is buying.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Three times the cost of a pepper. Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. **Cost of an orange**: 5 dollars less than the cost of a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the fruits Dillon is buying:

- **Total cost for watermelons**: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- **Total cost for peppers**: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- **Total cost for oranges**: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

"To calculate the profit the hospital makes from these visits, we need to determine the revenue and the cost for each patient and then multiply by the number of patients seen in a day.

First, let's calculate the revenue the hospital receives from each patient. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. The hospital charges $200 per hour, so the revenue from each patient is:
\[ 0.4 \text{ hours} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost the hospital incurs for each patient. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the cost for each patient is:
\[ 0.4 \text{ hours} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

The profit from each patient is the revenue minus the cost:
\[ \$80 - \$60 = \$20 \]

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day, the total profit for the day is:
\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times \$20/\text{patient} = \$10,000 \]

Therefore, the hospital's profit from these visits is:
\[ \$10,000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them. This is a third of the initial number, so we calculate \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \).
3. Subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number to find out how many elves remain: \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).
4. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."

- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Pam are \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, let's calculate the tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the roller coaster are \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times.
- Each ride costs 6 tickets.
- Therefore, the tickets used for the luge are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- The total tickets used by Fred are \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Finally, the total tickets used by both Pam and Fred are:
- Pam's tickets: 24
- Fred's tickets: 36
- Total tickets used: \(24 + 36 = 60\)

Thus, the total number of tickets they used that day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the miles he walked on Tuesday. Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, we can calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as follows:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. We can use this information to find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday. Let's denote the miles walked on Wednesday as \( W \). The total mileage can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Monday} + \text{Miles walked on Tuesday} + \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4 + 24 + W = 41 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 28 + W = 41 \]

To find \( W \), we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:

\[ W = 41 - 28 \]
\[ W = 13 \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Tom in a year, we can multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the cost of each car wash and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. Therefore, the cost per month is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for a year would be:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$720 \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has after losing 5 of them. Initially, Brian has 20 video games, but he lost 5, so:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Now, we know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. Since Brian now has 15 video games, we calculate 3 times that number:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we first need to determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Given that one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6. 

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs:
2 subs * $7.50/sub = $15.00

Next, the cost of the chips:
2 bags * $1.50/bag = $3.00

Then, the cost of the cookies:
2 cookies * $1.00/cookie = $2.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the items before the delivery fee and tip:
$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

The delivery fee is 20% of the total cost of the items:
20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
$20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Finally, adding the tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

So, Rory's total delivery order cost is $29.00."
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed on each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions on each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete on the first test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed on the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we find out how many questions he left incomplete on the second test:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Finally, we sum the incomplete questions from both tests to get the total number of questions Mark left incomplete:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs (\( B = 12 \)), we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of pink gumballs (\( P \)):
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many of the cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is:

\[ 20\% \]

Let me now present the final numerical answer in a separate line:

\[ 20 \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write:
\[ W = 2B \]

Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write:
\[ B = 2Q \]

The total number of bees in the hive is 700, so we can write:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bee equation, we get:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \) in the equation:
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan plays video games in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan would work in a week if he spent his video game time working.
3. Calculate the total earnings from working those hours.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of hours he plays video games in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would work 14 hours a week. He earns $10 an hour, so his weekly earnings would be:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 140 \]"
"To calculate the total cost including tax, we first need to identify the nonfood items and their respective costs. The nonfood items are light bulbs and roach traps, with costs of 3 dollars and 4 dollars respectively. The food items are milk, eggs, and cups, with costs of 2 dollars, 3 dollars, and 3 dollars respectively.

The total cost of nonfood items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of 7 dollars:
\[ 0.10 \times 7 = 0.70 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the nonfood items including tax is:
\[ 7 + 0.70 = 7.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the food items to the cost of the nonfood items gives us the total cost:
\[ 8 + 7.70 = 15.70 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{15.70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so the total number of clients is 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach for one client is 2 * $2 = $4. The cost of one pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total cost for one client is $4 + $5 = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be 8 * $9 = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income: $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, the profit Lucas will make each week is $20."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one hectare in a year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare in a year by the total number of hectares John has.

First, since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, there are 4 harvest cycles in a year. Therefore, the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Next, since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of pieces in each lego set:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces Johnny has to pick up:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego pieces. 

The final numerical answer is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:** 30 bees.
2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:** Half of the 30 bees that left, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:** Twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. **Bee population at the end of the third 6-hour period:** Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, so the hive had 0 bees. After 15 bees returned, the hive had 15 bees. After 60 bees left, the hive had 15 - 60 = -45 bees. Since the hive cannot have a negative number of bees, this implies that the hive was empty before the 60 bees left, and thus the hive had 0 bees after the 60 bees left.

5. **Bee population at the end of the fourth 6-hour period:** All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours return to the hive. The bees that left in the first 6 hours were 30, and the bees that left in the next 6 hours were 60, so a total of 90 bees left. Since the hive had 0 bees at the end of the third 6-hour period, all 90 bees return to the hive.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, and then add the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
The cost of a child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. Therefore, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Thus, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To find out how many friends James has on Facebook, we first need to determine how many friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Dorothy's number of friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's number of friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can determine how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distance from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to travel the distance.

Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their times is:

40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

4 minutes"
"To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of tires inflated by the cost per tire and then sum these amounts.

First, for the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 bicycles came by.
- Each tire costs 25 cents.
- Total cost for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * $0.25/tire = $2.50.

Next, for the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 tricycles came by.
- Each tire costs 25 cents.
- Total cost for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * $0.25/tire = $2.25.

Finally, for the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came by on a unicycle.
- Each tire costs 25 cents.
- Total cost for the unicycle = 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * $0.25/tire = $0.25.

Now, summing these amounts:
- Total earnings = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

Dave ate 14 fries, so the number of fries left after he ate is \( x - 14 \).

The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the number of fries left after the seagull ate is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The number of fries left after the pigeons ate is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

A raccoon then ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries. The number of fries left after the raccoon ate is \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).

Ants then ate one final fry, leaving 5 fries. So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

Thus, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 48 \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours he spends each day and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on these days is:
\[ 2 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Adding the hours from both sets of days gives the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 272 \]"
"To find the total length of all the baked goods Bill bakes in a day, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total length of the rolls:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants every day.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's calculate the total length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes every day.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Therefore, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum up the total lengths of all the baked goods:
- The total length is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide the total length in inches by 12:
- The total length in feet is \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape per month and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Each monkey needs 200 bananas per month.
   - There are no specific numbers given for the number of monkeys, but we can assume there are enough to meet the requirement.
   - Total bananas needed for monkeys in 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\).

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Each gorilla needs 400 bananas per month.
   - There are no specific numbers given for the number of gorillas, but we can assume there are enough to meet the requirement.
   - Total bananas needed for gorillas in 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\).

3. **Baboons:**
   - Each baboon needs 100 bananas per month.
   - There are no specific numbers given for the number of baboons, but we can assume there are enough to meet the requirement.
   - Total bananas needed for baboons in 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\).

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes in 2 months:
\[ 400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then compare the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we first need to determine the depth of the water on Tuesday and then calculate the depth on Wednesday based on that.

On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the depth of the water is 7 feet more than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by each person and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Next, we calculate the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Finally, we sum up all the fish caught:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

First, let's determine the number of price increases that occur in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases is:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

The price of the bag of marbles after each increase can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the original price is the principal, and the rate of increase is 20% or 0.20. The formula for the price after \( n \) increases is:
\[ P_n = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P_0 \) is the original price, \( r \) is the rate of increase, and \( n \) is the number of increases.

Here, \( P_0 = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

Therefore, the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{209.76} \]"
"To solve this, we need to determine the value of each toy based on the given information.

First, we know that one red car costs $4. Since a doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and an action figure costs $5, then 3 action figures cost $5 * 3 = $15. Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, we can calculate the total value of all the toys:
- The value of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.
- The value of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.
- The value of the doll is $15.

Adding these values together, the total value of all the toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the missed income from doing her taxes herself and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses $35/hour in missed income for each hour she does not do freelance work. If we assume she would have worked for \( x \) hours, then the missed income would be \( 35x \) dollars. If she hires an accountant, she will not lose any income from freelance work, so the missed income is zero.

The cost of hiring the accountant is $90. Therefore, the additional income Jackie will have if she hires the accountant is the cost of the accountant's services, which is $90.

The final numerical answer is:
90"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the computer accessories Elvira has chosen:

- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Adding these together:

\[ 157 + 74 + 102 + 74 + 102 = 509 \]

Elvira's total budget for the computer and accessories is €1500. The cost of the computer and accessories is €509. Therefore, the remaining budget for a garment is:

\[ 1500 - 509 = 991 \]

So, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra has to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs needed to make 15 flans.
2. Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get that many eggs.

First, we know that each flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is $8 * 2 = $16. Jimmy has $2 more than this amount, so Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his daily walking distance, taking into account that he walks 10 miles on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

First, we calculate the miles he walks from Monday to Friday:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the miles he walks on the weekend:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from the weekdays and the weekend:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each component of the uniform:

- The cost of the hat is $25.
- The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so it is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
- The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so it is \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs from each group of creatures separately and then sum them up.

For the spiders:
- There are 80 spiders.
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the spiders is \(80 \times 8 = 640\).

For the insects:
- There are 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the insects is \(90 \times 6 = 540\).

For the rare mutant invertebrates:
- There are 3 invertebrates.
- Each invertebrate has 10 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the invertebrates is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, we sum the legs from all the groups:
- Legs from spiders: 640
- Legs from insects: 540
- Legs from invertebrates: 30

Total number of legs = \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\).

Thus, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's first establish the ages of the birds based on the information provided:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

The minimum monthly payments are:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payment and add it to the minimum monthly payment:
\[ 1000 \times 0.50 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \]

So, Jessica pays $1500 per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will take to peel and cut all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the time taken for each task and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time taken to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time taken to peel is \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time taken to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the time taken to cut is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds.

Now, we need to convert the cutting time into minutes to add it to the peeling time:
- 300 seconds is equal to \(300 / 60 = 5\) minutes.

Finally, we add the peeling time and the cutting time:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is 95 minutes."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total revenue and then subtract the cost to find the profit. We know the profit is $25, and the cost of ingredients per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which totals $5 per gallon.

The cost per gallon is $5, and they sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 each, so the revenue per gallon is $10. 

Let's denote the number of gallons they sold as \( x \). The total revenue is \( 10x \) and the total cost is \( 5x \). The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost, which is \( 10x - 5x = 5x \).

Given that the profit is $25, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5x = 25 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 5 \]

This means they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Since the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, the total cost of lemons is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is $15. Let's confirm this with the final numerical answer:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity.
   \[
   \text{Charity Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**

So, the final numerical answer is 350 dollars."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum them up.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as \( B \). Therefore, \( B = 40 \).

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Let's denote the number of crabs Monic has as \( M \). Therefore, \( M = B - 4 \). Substituting the value of \( B \):

\[ M = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's denote the number of crabs Rani has as \( R \). Therefore, \( R = M + 10 \). Substituting the value of \( M \):

\[ R = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together. We sum the crabs each person has:

\[ \text{Total} = R + M + B = 46 + 36 + 40 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he tutored each week by his hourly rate and then add the totals together.

For the first week:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner received. The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. Given that the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes cast is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total number of votes minus the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

From the problem, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).

We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations, so we can write the equation:
\[ 200 = 5w \]

Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of white carnations is 40, we can find the number of red roses:
\[ 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years less than half of Jan's age at that time.

First, let's determine Jan's age two years ago:
- Jan's current age is 30, so two years ago she was 28.

Next, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
- Half of Jan's age two years ago is 28 / 2 = 14.

According to the information given, two years ago Mark's age was 5 years less than this value:
- Mark's age two years ago was 14 - 5 = 9.

Now, we need to find Mark's current age:
- Since Mark was 9 two years ago, his current age is 9 + 2 = 11.

Finally, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age is 11 + 2 = 13.

Therefore, Jean is 13 years old."
"To determine the winning margin between the two teams, we first calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 1600 meters relay race.

For the first team, each member runs their leg in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (3 seconds faster than the first), the third runner takes 54 seconds (3 seconds faster than the second), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (3 seconds faster than the third). The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

The difference in time between the second team and the first team is:

Therefore, the faster team (the first team) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two separate events and then compare them.

First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers on a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability \(P(\text{number} > 3)\) is:

\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \(\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). Given that the first roll is even, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability \(P(\text{two even numbers in a row})\) is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:

\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To convert this difference to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of pieces of straw distributed:

\[ 3r \times 6 + 10 \times 5 + 20 = 160 \]

This equation accounts for the straw given to the rats (3 cages with \( r \) rats each, 6 pieces per rat), the straw given to the hamsters (10 cages with 5 pieces each), and the straw given to the rabbits (20 pieces).

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]
\[ 18r = 90 \]
\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and add it to the original amount owed.

The original amount owed is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%. Therefore, the interest for one month is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is compounded monthly, the interest for 3 months would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the interest to the original amount gives:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106 after 3 months. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{106} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat as \( n \).

The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the wheat is \( 20n \) dollars.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars.

The total cost incurred by the trader is the sum of the cost of buying the wheat and the cost of transporting it, which is \( 20n + 2n = 22n \) dollars.

The trader sells all the bags at a rate of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling the wheat is \( 30n \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, we can write the equation for profit as:

\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8n = 400 \]

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ n = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total amount spent by the three friends.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, we add up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend paid:
Each friend's share = Total cost / 3
Each friend's share = $102 / 3 = $34

So, the final numerical answer is $34."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to calculate the total number of peaches he can collect in 3 hours, given that he collects 2 peaches per minute.

First, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the total number of peaches John collects is:

\[ 360 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 360 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for all the ducks combined.

Given that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Insects per day for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, to find out how many pounds of insects the entire flock of ten ducks need per day, we multiply the amount of insects needed per day for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Insects per day for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net increase in the number of trees each year, and then apply the 30% mortality rate after 10 years.

First, let's determine the net increase in the number of trees each year. Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees after 10 years, assuming no trees die during this period. Starting with 50 trees, the number of trees after 10 years would be:
\[ 50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees} \]

However, 30% of these trees die after 10 years. So, we need to calculate 30% of 130 trees and subtract that from the total:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]
\[ 130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the events:

1. On Friday morning, Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos were taken back, painted white, and put back out. One third of 18 is 6, so 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white. This means 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos remained on Sue's front yard.
3. On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday morning was 12 + 18 = 30.
4. On Sunday morning, no white flamingos were added, so there were still 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink flamingos were out than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

30 (pink flamingos) - 6 (white flamingos) = 24

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"To determine how much change Violetta will get, we first need to calculate the total cost of the crayons she wants to buy. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of the crayons is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she prepared:

\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of change Violetta will get is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, so the combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means that a pen costs $1.50. Now, to find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 12.00 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, so the total amount distributed will be:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. Therefore, the amount of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)

Let's calculate the number of children:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of cards**: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First month collection**: She collected three times the number of cards she initially had. Therefore, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards in the first month. After the first month, she had \(20 + 60 = 80\) cards.

3. **Second month collection**: She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. Therefore, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards in the second month. After the second month, she had \(80 + 40 = 120\) cards.

4. **Third month collection**: She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). Therefore, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards in the third month. After the third month, she had \(120 + 200 = 320\) cards.

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 320."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate the total payment from both publishers based on the number of sentences he edits and the rates paid by each publisher.

First, we know that Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the payment from Publisher A is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence. Therefore, the rate from Publisher B is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
Thus, the payment from Publisher B is:
\[ \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total payment Mark receives in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails of water in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is:

\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Each pail contains 5 liters of water, so the total number of liters of water he gets every day is:

\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the salary increase.

First, let's calculate the salary increase:
- John's current weekly salary is $2000.
- The raise is 5% of his current salary.
- The raise amount is \( 2000 \times 0.05 = 100 \) dollars per week.

Next, we calculate his new weekly salary after the raise:
- New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100.

Now, we calculate his total earnings for the year:
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- His total earnings from the raise over the year = $2100 \times 52 = $109,200.

Additionally, he received a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:
- Total earnings = $109,200 (from the raise) + $5000 (from the award) = $114,200.

So, the final numerical answer is:
114200"
"First, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. Josie has 10 acres of grapevines, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many barrels of wine can be produced from these 50 tons of grapes. Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into parts and sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 5 days * 2 slices/day = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese used for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up the slices of cheese used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:
- Total slices of cheese = 10 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 27 slices.

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is 27."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. Therefore, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has now. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens we bought, we get:

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate the sum of her first five test scores and then determine the score required on the sixth test.

The scores of the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The sum of these scores is:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \). The average of the six test scores will be:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} \]

We want this average to be 93, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{440 + x}{6} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ 440 + x = 558 \]

Then, we subtract 440 from both sides:
\[ x = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 118 \]"
"To calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the total kilometers Micheal rode his bike is 860 kilometers."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we first need to determine the weight of each type of candy and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we sum the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of the bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2600 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, so the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups is equal to 240 cups, the cost of one cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{145} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:

\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn. She earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times, so she earns:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn by \( x \). Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so she earns:

\[ 4x \]

Adding her initial savings of $10, her total money after babysitting and mowing the lawn will be:

\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least equal to the cost of the jacket and shoes, which is $70. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:

\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Additionally, it is given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected each day can be expressed as:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected each day would be:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the second day. Since the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, and there were 100 customers on the first day, the number of customers on the second day is 100 + 50 = 150.
2. Calculate the total number of customers over the first two days. This is the sum of the customers on the first and second days, which is 100 + 150 = 250.
3. Given that the total number of customers over the three days is 500, we can find the number of customers on the third day by subtracting the total number of customers over the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days. This is 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 4 \times 4 = 2(S - 4 \times 4) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ B = 2S - 16 \]

Now, we know that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the equation \( B = 2S - 16 \):
\[ 4S = 2S - 16 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = -8 \]

Since the amount of water cannot be negative, we need to recheck the setup. The negative value indicates an error in the interpretation or setup. Let's recheck the equations and the context. The correct interpretation should be:

\[ B = 4S \]
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]

Substituting \( B = 4S \) into the second equation:
\[ 4S - 16 = 2(S - 16) \]
\[ 4S - 16 = 2S - 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = -32 + 16 \]
\[ 2S = -16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. Let's verify:
If the small pool has 8 gallons, then the big pool has \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) gallons. Four minutes ago, the small pool had \( 8 - 16 = 0 \) gallons and the big pool had \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) gallons, which is indeed twice as much as the small pool (0 gallons).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work, I'll first determine the total cost of her purchase and then divide that by her hourly wage.

The total cost of the shoes and the belt is:
$320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, I'll divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44.00

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She promised to return the principal amount plus 10% of the principal amount. The principal amount is $2000.

The additional amount she promised to return is:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months. She pays $165 per month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months. The remaining balance is the total amount she promised to return minus the total amount she will pay:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages.

Given:
- Harriet's current age is 21 years.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, calculate their ages in three years:
- Adrian's age in three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Harriet's age in three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Zack's age in three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

Finally, calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the points scored by Naomi and Yuri from the total points.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
5. The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's score is:
   \[
   \text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine used 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

\[ 90 \text{ liters} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider the time it takes for each leg of his trip.

First, we know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester, the travel time by car is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total travel time will be the sum of the travel times for each leg of the trip:
\[ 6 \text{ days (bus to Rochester)} + 3 \text{ days (car from Rochester)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the new number of water type cards after James loses 8 of them and then determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card.

Initially, James has 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

James then buys 14 more grass type cards, but this does not affect the number of water type cards. So, the total number of cards now is:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} + 20 \text{ (grass type)} = 82 \text{ total cards} \]

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \frac{32}{82} \times 100 \approx 39.18 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 39\% \]

"To calculate the total cost Chad owes, we first sum up the individual costs of the items he ordered:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, we add the extra $3.00 for chips and a drink:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, which he uses to reduce the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which is 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so the time it will take them to complete the puzzle is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons remaining. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. This leaves:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 21 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees. Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration fees.

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Mark then pays $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collects \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. Therefore, on Tuesday, Kylie collects \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"If there were 50 ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many penguins jump into the ocean and how many go into the cave.

One-third of the 36 penguins jump into the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third go into the cave:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go into the ocean and 12 penguins go into the cave. The total number of penguins that leave the snow to go into the ocean or the cave is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing in the snow is:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To determine how many tomato vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate how many tomatoes he consumes per week.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he eats:
\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as he does, so she eats:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{2} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Together, they eat:
\[ 42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 21 tomato vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend is to have 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to provide these 80 slices. Each pizza is sold sliced into 8 portions. Therefore, the number of pizzas needed is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new ones. Ram starts with 25 pens and can use the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. This means that for every five empty pens, he can make one new pen.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. After this, he will have 20 pens left (25 - 5 = 20).
3. **Second Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 15 pens left (20 - 5 = 15).
4. **Third Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 10 pens left (15 - 5 = 10).
5. **Fourth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 5 pens left (10 - 5 = 5).
6. **Fifth Round of Mixing**: He can use the ink from 5 more pens to make another 1 new pen. After this, he will have 0 pens left (5 - 5 = 0).

At this point, Ram has used all 25 pens to make new ones, and he has made 5 new pens in total. Therefore, the total number of pens he has is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made.

So, the total number of pens Ram has is:
\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we first need to determine the ages of each individual.

Given:
- Jessa is 20 years old.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.

First, calculate Joan's age:
\[
\text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, calculate Mary's age:
\[
\text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Now, sum the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa:
\[
\text{Sum of their ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20 = 68

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many candies Robert has. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ 54 = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} \]
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can determine how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 \]
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We already know John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

The final numerical answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many people Mike is still penpals with. Initially, he had 5 pen pals, and he stopped being penpals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is still penpals with:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ people} \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pages per week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals per week is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ pages per week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages per week. Each page takes him 6 minutes to write. Therefore, the total time spent writing per week is:
\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes per week} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours per week} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used this month and subtract that from his monthly plan limit.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used for his daily calls with his boss. Since he makes a 15-minute call every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes used for these calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he has used for other people this month, which is 300 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes used this month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan limit:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. At the end, Griffin had 27 fries. This means Ginger must have given Griffin \(27 - 7 = 20\) fries.

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for Jean during the movie:

- She requires makeup done 4 times a week.
- Each session takes 6 hours.
- The movie lasts for 5 weeks.

Total hours worked = 4 sessions/week * 6 hours/session * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

So, Jean paid $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the individual expenses:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split the total cost evenly among her three parents, so we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Therefore, each person paid $32."
"To find out how much the chef spent, we need to calculate the total weight of the onions and then multiply by the cost per pound.

First, calculate the total weight of the onions:
- Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
- The chef bought 4 bags.
- Therefore, the total weight is \( 4 \times 50 = 200 \) pounds.

Next, calculate the total cost:
- The cost of 1 pound of onions is $1.50.
- The total weight is 200 pounds.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 200 \times 1.50 = 300 \) dollars.

So, the chef spent $300."
"To solve this, let's first determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)

Sue's sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Each cookie has 200 calories, so we can calculate the total calories consumed by each.

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

The difference in calories consumed is:

\(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To solve this, we first need to determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

The first class has 20 students, and 15 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the first class is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys} \]

The second class has 20 students, and 12 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the second class is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys} \]

Now, we need to find the number of boys in the third class. Since the total number of boys in the school is 30, and we already know the number of boys in the first and second classes, we can calculate the number of boys in the third class as follows:
\[ 30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 17 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( w_1 \) be the number of wolves killed last night.
- Let \( c_1 \) be the number of cougars killed last night.
- Let \( w_2 \) be the number of wolves killed today.
- Let \( c_2 \) be the number of cougars killed today.

From the problem, we know:
- \( w_1 = 10 \)
- \( c_1 = 15 \)
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars: \( w_2 = 3c_2 \)
- Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night: \( c_2 = c_1 - 3 \)

Now, let's calculate \( c_2 \):
\[ c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate \( w_2 \):
\[ w_2 = 3c_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we can find the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( w_1 = 10 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( w_2 = 36 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( c_1 = 15 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( c_2 = 12 \)

Total number of animals killed:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne and Mitchel went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's rides} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:
\[ \text{Robert's rides} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to 10 * 20 = 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall gets 40 / 20 = 2 new cows. 

Therefore, each stall now has 20 (original cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows. 

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176.

"First, we need to determine the total length of the redwood tree in feet, which is given as 200 feet.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree before any damage. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}

Now, we need to account for the damage caused by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Therefore, we can write:

\[ J_a + 8 = 52 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

So, Jamal has 44 apples. The problem also states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write:

\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]

Substituting the value of \( J_a \):

\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

So, Jamal has 48 bananas. Now, we need to find out how many fruits Andrea has. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, and the same number of apples as Jamal. Therefore, Andrea has:

\[ \text{Apples Andrea has} = J_a = 44 \]
\[ \text{Bananas Andrea has} = \frac{J_b}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Adding the number of apples and bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Total fruits Andrea has} = 44 + 24 = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9300
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in the stack.

Since each penny is worth $0.01, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
6200 \times 0.01 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars."

\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

First, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
Brokerage fee = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee:
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
Transfer fee = $42,000

Now, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Finally, let's find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000
Difference = $9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total fees Mr. Tan paid. This includes the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

\[ \text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees from the selling price and then subtract the loan amount.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken.

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. The oil takes 20 minutes to heat to 300 degrees. It then takes 40% longer to heat to 400 degrees. 

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum up all the times:
- Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ \boxed{71} \]"
"To calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

The cost for the newspaper ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5 = 250 \]

The cost for the television ads is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad} \]
\[ \text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75 = 1125 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Cost of television ads} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we first need to determine the number of golf balls. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls and half of these are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
Number of golf balls = 16 / 2
Number of golf balls = 8

Now, we know that half of these golf balls are blue. Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is:

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
Number of blue golf balls = 8 / 2
Number of blue golf balls = 4

The final numerical answer is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

First, we know the first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag:
\[ 300 + 12 = 312 \]

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is:
\[ 762 \]"
"To find the total number of windows in John's houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Next, we add the additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.

So, the total number of windows in one house is:
\[6 + 4 = 10\]

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the number of windows in one house by 2:
\[10 \times 2 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of windows in both houses is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To find out the change, I'll first calculate the total cost of the items purchased and then subtract that from the amount paid.

The total cost is $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.95.

Therefore, the change given back is $20.00 - $14.95 = $5.05.

The final numerical answer is $5.05."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first determine the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches.

The collar takes a tenth of the stitches for the body of the sweater. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. Therefore, the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:
\[ \text{Stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

Thus, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is:
\[ \boxed{765} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

The cost of the tomato seeds is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = \$800 \]

The cost of the celery seeds is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of celery seeds} = 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = \$2400 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \$3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and the solo song, and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has a third of the lines in the first scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
   \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Therefore, the second scene has:
   \[
   54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
   \]
   Sean has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene, so he has:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
   \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   \[
   54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138
   \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
\[
\boxed{138}

"First, let's calculate the number of cards that had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cards remained after removing the ones with letter A:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

After removing the cards with letter B, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Then, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:

\[ \text{Number of cards with letter C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

After removing the cards with letter C, we have:

\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 = 9 \]

The remaining cards, which have the letter D on them, are 9. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first calculate the time required for each type of hole.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Thus, the final numerical answer is 4 hours."
"Let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( P \). According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 20, so we have:

\[ M + P = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( P + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (P + 10) = M + P + 20 \]

Since we know that \( M + P = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + P + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. 

The final numerical answer is 6."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each:

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \]

So, the cost of the popsicles is $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each:

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \]

So, the cost of the ice cream bars is $2.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is $7."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of spots for both cobras and mambas, and then find half of that total.

First, let's determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of spots a mamba has} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:
\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:
\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots for the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:
\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:
\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people who will be eating the pizza.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests.

The total number of people is:
12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people.

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones used in the necklace.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. The remaining length after accounting for the topaz gemstones is the length used by the sterling silver beads. This length is:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of sterling silver beads used, we divide the length used by the beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we need to calculate the number of stories each wrote in both weeks and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Next, we calculate the number of stories each wrote in the second week, which is double the number they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, we sum up the total number of stories written by each of them over the two weeks:
- Alani's total: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen's total: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot's total: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we first need to determine the total number of stars on the flag and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. We can break this down into the rows of 8 and 6 stars:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)

Now, we subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars to find the number of stars in the rows of 5 stars:

\[76 - (24 + 12) = 76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each of these remaining rows has 5 stars, we divide the number of stars in these rows by 5 to find the number of rows:

\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag. The final numerical answer is:

8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we first calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles/hour.

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula for time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at a constant speed of 30 miles/hour and it is covering the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of medals given out for counting. Let's break down the information given:

- Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- There are 8 packets.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

Next, let's determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get:

- There are 4 adults.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars for the adults is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

Now, we can find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

- The total number of chocolate bars is 40.
- The number of chocolate bars for the adults is 24.
- Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left for the children is \(40 - 24 = 16\).

Finally, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

- There are 8 children.
- Therefore, each child will get \(16 \div 8 = 2\) chocolate bars.

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since she pauses for half an hour, we subtract this from the total time:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Next, we convert the working time into minutes because Susan earns money based on a 10-minute interval. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by $5:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns is $75."
"To determine the total points after the extra points are distributed, we first need to find out how many points each player has after the initial 3 rounds.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if any of the players need extra points in the fourth round. The extra point is given to players who have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.

After the extra points are distributed, the points are as follows:
- Mike has \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has \(18\) points.
- Tony has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players:
\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

Thus, the total points after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."

"Let's calculate the total number of each activity Darren does in the two days.

On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Doubles the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220 pushups
- Total squats: 50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90 squats
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60 dumbbell presses

Finally, let's add up all the activities:
- Total activities = 220 pushups + 90 squats + 60 dumbbell presses = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members in the household and they eat rice at lunch and dinner, each person eats 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Therefore, the total consumption per day for the household is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \]"

- He sold 20 crates over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Adding these up:
\[ 20 \text{ (weekend)} + 15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)} = 65 \text{ crates} \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-55} \]"
"To determine the cost of the antique desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bid, considering that she bids after each of the 3 other people and the bids increase by $50 each time.

Let's denote the initial bid as $200. The bids increase by $50 each time, and Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people. Therefore, the bids made by the other 3 people are $200, $250, and $300. Carmen's bids will be $350, $400, and $450, since she bids after each of the other 3 people.

Now, let's sum up all the bids:
- The first person's bid: $200
- The second person's bid: $250
- The third person's bid: $300
- Carmen's first bid: $350
- Carmen's second bid: $400
- Carmen's third bid: $450

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 450 \]

We can group and add them step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]
\[ 1100 + 400 = 1500 \]
\[ 1500 + 450 = 1950 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Carmen spends on the desk is:
\[ \boxed{1950} \]"
"To calculate the total amount John pays for driving a year, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost per mile driven and the monthly bonus.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year. John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so he drives 60 miles each day. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles driven in a year is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the miles driven. The cost is $2 per mile, so:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30000 \text{ per year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver in a year. The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1800 \text{ per year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays in a year:
\[ \$30000 + \$1800 = \$31800 \]

So, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:
\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two pages on each side of the fold. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print two pages.

Given that the tabloid is 32 pages long, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by 2:

\[
\frac{32}{2} = 16
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 16."
"Annika initially had $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had $50 - $25 = $25 left. She then spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the amount left after spending on rides is $25 - $10 = $15.

The final amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Total books: 250
- Unsold books: 50
- Books sold: 250 - 50 = 200
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books sold in the first year: 2 * 45 = 90
- Books sold in the second year: 200 - 45 - 90 = 65

Each book sells for $20, so the earnings for the second year can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Earnings in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The final numerical answer is 1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so his weekly hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

Given that he earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since Watson received a $300 bonus each week for the company performing well, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

April has 4 weeks, so his total earnings for the month of April are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"To determine how many people John lost to, we first need to calculate how many people he beat. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles, we calculate:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Loaves Produced**: The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Morning Sales**: Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   \[
   \text{Morning Sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Remaining Loaves After Morning Sales**: Subtract the morning sales from the total production.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Afternoon and Evening Sales**: Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening.
   \[
   \text{Afternoon and Evening Sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Afternoon Sales**: Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the afternoon and evening sales.
   \[
   \text{Afternoon Sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 5."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses in a single week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight Sandy needs to lose in 4 weeks is 2 pounds. 

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds, we can use the fact that Sandy loses weight at the same rate as Joey, but over a longer period. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds in 1 week, but over 4 weeks. Thus, it will take Sandy 1 week to lose 2 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
- Savings on two tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Let's assume the original price of one packet of milk is $M (we don't know the exact price, but we know the discount is $0.5)
- Discounted price of one packet of milk: $M - $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $M - $0.5
- Savings on four packets of milk: ($M - $0.5) * 4

Since we don't have the exact price of one packet of milk, we can't calculate the exact savings on the milk. However, the problem asks for the savings on the ice cream, which we have already calculated.

Therefore, the total savings on 2 tubs of ice cream is $4.

The final numerical answer is:
$4"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of extra arms and extra legs that grow based on the given growth rates.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra arm grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 3, which is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).
- Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in fifteen days.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every five days.
- In fifteen days, the number of times an extra leg grows is given by the integer division of 15 by 5, which is \(15 \div 5 = 3\).
- Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in fifteen days.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
- Total new limbs = number of extra arms + number of extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 business suits at $100 each = 6 * $100 = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases at $50 each = 3 * $50 = $150

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
The flight ticket costs = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
Total expenses = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
Total expenses = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

Theo has $6000 to spend on his trip, and he wishes to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on the trip is:
Amount to spend = Total money - Savings
Amount to spend = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Finally, to find out how much he has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
Amount to spend on gifts = Amount to spend - Total expenses
Amount to spend on gifts = $4000 - $1950 = $2050

The final numerical answer is $2050."
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to break down the daily consumption and then extend it to a week.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption:
- Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 13 \times 7 = 91 \]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we first need to determine Jane's age. We know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30 years old.

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find Trent's age. Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 32."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

3. **Use the given information about the population six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population six years ago was \(P / 2\) and we know it was 60000, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{P}{2} = 60000
     \]
   - Solving for \(P\):
     \[
     P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000
     \]

Thus, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Also, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players in the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2, so we rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for those who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people.

Then, we account for those who couldn't come due to previous commitments. This number is 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is the total number of people invited minus the number who couldn't come: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the final numerical answer is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after adding the marbles he bought from Johanna to the store's existing marbles.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and the store already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds his marbles is:
\[ 20 + 50 = 70 \]

Next, Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by Solomon's father to the marbles already in the store:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To find the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 24 \times 5 \]

\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 12 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Let's denote the number of boys in the classroom as \( B \), the number of girls as \( G \), and the number of nongendered children as \( N \).

Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we have:
\[ B = 30 \]

Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, we can write:
\[ G = 3B \]
\[ G = 3 \times 30 \]
\[ G = 90 \]

Also, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10}B \]
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 \]
\[ N = 3 \]

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total children} = B + G + N \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and knowing that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles.

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles and \( W \) be the number of electric wires. According to the ratio, we have:
\[ P : W = 1 : 3 \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute this value into the ratio to find \( P \):
\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To solve for \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of women left at the party after some people left.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. This means that 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 22 men out of the 25 men initially were not among the 10 people who left. Therefore, 3 men left the party.

Since 10 people in total left the party, and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must have been women.

Thus, the number of women who left is 7. Since there were initially 15 women, the number of women left at the party is:

15 - 7 = 8

So, the final numerical answer is 8."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many pencils Jam has in her boxes. We know that Jam has 2 loose pencils and a total of 26 pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils in her boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam has. Since the problem does not specify the number of pencils per box, we assume that each box contains the same number of pencils. However, the number of boxes Jam has is not directly asked, but rather the total number of boxes needed to store all their pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed to store all the pencils, we need to consider the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

If we assume each box can hold the same number of pencils, we need to find the minimum number of boxes required to store 72 pencils. The number of boxes needed is the total number of pencils divided by the number of pencils per box. Since the number of pencils per box is not specified, we can only determine the total number of boxes needed if we assume the smallest possible number of pencils per box, which is 1. In that case, the total number of boxes needed is:

\[ 72 \]

Therefore, the total number of boxes needed to store all their pencils is:

\[ 72 \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effect of the cooling and the added liquid separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters weaker.

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much stronger the drink is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling, which is 60 milliliters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"If 5 people leave with 7 new records between them, and each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, then the total number of new records traded is 7. Since each new record traded is equivalent to 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior and senior programmers.

Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ \text{Payment to each senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Therefore, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment to all programmers} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are told that at the third stop, there were 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time required to charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the total percentage increase needed to reach 100% from 60%:

100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, it will take:

40% * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert this time into hours:

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 2 hours."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, so she now has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella. Therefore, the number of lollipops Erin has left is:

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, for $80 spent, they earn $8 off their next purchase (since $80 / $20 = 4, and 4 * $1 = $8).

2. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their $8 rewards on the current shopping trip.
   - The current shopping trip cost $43.
   - After applying the $8 rewards, the cost becomes $43 - $8 = $35.

3. **Apply the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards, which is twice $8, or $16.
   - The final cost after applying the coupon is $35 - $16 = $19.

Therefore, the customer paid $19 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick should choose, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after taxes.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per year: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net gross pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Net income tax rate: 10%
- Net income tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, compared to the other job."

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we find out how many hot dogs John ate. John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:

\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group will be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens. Each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

The total number of legs the animals have is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks). Therefore, the total number of balls he would have is 3 (initial) + 4 (added) = 7 balls. However, when he starts juggling on stage, he drops 3 balls, 2 of which are caught by people in the crowd and 1 is lost. Thus, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is 7 - 3 = 4 balls. 

The final numerical answer is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the weights of the animals based on the pink frog's weight:**
   - The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
   - A blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so a blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
   - A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so a green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
   - A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than a pink frog, so a yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
   - A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than a pink frog, so a red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:**
   - The total weight of the animals is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, the yellow snake, and the red bird.
   - This is \(50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240\) pounds.
   - The container itself weighs 20 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is \(240 + 20 = 260\) pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month, given that he increases his daily distance by 1/5 of his original distance.

First, let's determine the new daily distance Tyson runs:
- Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters.
- The increase in distance is 1/5 of 5000 meters, which is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \) meters.
- Therefore, the new daily distance is \( 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \) meters.

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month. June has 30 days, so:
- The total distance Tyson runs in June is \( 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \).

The total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

- The difference is 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to determine the total cost of the shirts before the discount, and then apply the discount.

The cost of one shirt is $30. Therefore, the cost of 2 shirts before the discount is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

A 40% discount means Davos pays 60% of the original price. To find out how much he pays, we calculate 60% of $60:
\[ 60 \times 0.60 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find the percentage increase in the amount of money made per day, we first need to calculate the daily earnings from tractors and silos.

When they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- They made $100 per tractor.
- Therefore, their daily earnings from tractors were \(10 \times 100 = \$1000\).

Now, they make silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- They make $220 per silo.
- Therefore, their daily earnings from silos are \(5 \times 220 = \$1100\).

To find the percentage increase in daily earnings:
- The increase in earnings is \(1100 - 1000 = \$100\).
- The percentage increase is calculated as \(\frac{100}{1000} \times 100 = 10\%\).

The final numerical answer is 10%."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to first calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

The cost of food per month is calculated as follows:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100.

The cost of treats per month is given as $20.

The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Adding these together gives the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine

Swimming time: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Total time for boating and swimming: 6 + 3 = 9 hours

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching the shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.

Total time for shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours

The shows and boating/swimming together account for 30% of the total time spent. Let's denote the total time spent as \( T \).

So, 30% of \( T \) is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

\[ 0.30 \times T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first need to determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the shortest and second trees combined. First, we calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ \text{Combined height of the shortest and second trees} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

- Cost of a round of mini-golf: $5
- Cost of arcade tokens: $5
- Cost of riding the go-karts twice: $10 x 2 = $20

Adding these up, the total cost for these activities is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan's budget for the party is $90. After spending $30 on the activities, she will have $90 - $30 = $60 left.

Since the question asks how many friends she can invite, and assuming that the remaining $60 is to be spent on food, drinks, or other party expenses, we need to determine how many friends can be invited. However, the question does not specify how much each friend would cost, so we can only determine the remaining budget after accounting for the activities.

Therefore, the remaining budget after the activities is $60, but without knowing the cost per person for food, drinks, or other expenses, we cannot determine the exact number of friends she can invite. The answer to the question as to how many friends she can invite, given the information provided, is not possible to calculate precisely. 

However, if we are to strictly follow the numerical answer format requested, the remaining budget after the activities is:

"To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply by 5.

First, let's calculate her daily spending on lollipops:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
- She buys 4 lollipops each day.

Daily cost of lollipops:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 25 \text{ cents per lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, which means he spends $2 on gumballs (since 40 * $0.05 = $2). This means he has $8 left after buying the candy.

The amount he has left after buying candy is $8. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the full change he received from his $10 is $10 - $8 = $2. This $2 is the amount he spent on candy.

Now, we can calculate how many pounds of candy he bought. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds he bought is $2 / $1.5 = 1.3333 pounds.

Therefore, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is 1.3333 pounds."

"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete trip from the first city to the third city and back to the first city.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip, which is 100 miles - 50 miles = 50 miles.

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles/day.

To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to divide the total distance traveled in a day by the distance at which the train needs service, which is 18,000 miles.

So, the number of days between services is:
675 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days.

Therefore, the train goes between services every 0.0375 days. To express this in a more understandable format, we can convert it to hours:
0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours.

However, the question asks for the number of days, so the final numerical answer is:
0.0375"

\[ \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time John spent on the detour. The detour added 10 miles to his trip, so the total distance for the detour is:

\[ \text{Total detour distance} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

The time taken for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time for detour} = \frac{\text{Detour distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time John spent driving back home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time taken for this part of the trip is:

\[ \text{Time to home} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to get the total trip time:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time for detour} + \text{Time to home} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7, so we convert 3 hours to a fraction with denominator 7:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total trip time is:

\[ \text{Total trip time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]"
"To find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we first need to determine the number of boys at the school on Friday.

Given:
- Total number of fourth-graders = 96
- Number of girls = 43
- Number of girls absent on Friday = 5
- Number of boys absent on Friday = 4

First, we calculate the number of girls present on Friday:
\[ \text{Girls present} = \text{Total girls} - \text{Girls absent} = 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate the number of boys at the school:
\[ \text{Boys} = \text{Total fourth-graders} - \text{Total girls} = 96 - 43 = 53 \]

Then, we calculate the number of boys present on Friday:
\[ \text{Boys present} = \text{Total boys} - \text{Boys absent} = 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"If there are 6 girls in the park and twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park. Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) represent the score on her third test. The equation for the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ 9 \]

\[

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is:
\[ 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. \]

Three times the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21. \]

The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we first need to establish the points Erin has after scoring 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

First, calculate how many points Sara has:
\[ \text{Sara's points} = 8 \]

Next, determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points:
\[ \text{Erin's points after scoring 14} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Erin's points after scoring 14 points is 24. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her total points after scoring:
\[ \text{Erin's points before scoring 14} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 20% of $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option and then subtract that from the original cost.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. To find the savings, we calculate 20% of $400:

\[ \text{Savings} = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

Subtracting the savings from the original cost gives us the total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of pairs sold each day and then account for the returns.

First, let's determine the number of pairs sold on each day:
- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) pairs.
- On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday, which is \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\) pairs.

Next, we sum the number of pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

However, 6 pairs were returned, so we need to subtract these returns from the total:
\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of pairs of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to determine the number of apples she picked on each day and then sum them up.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per piece. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide the total amount of money she made by the price per apple:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples she picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will have to pay over the five months. The interest rate is 10%, so the total interest for five months is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{10}{100} \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.0416666667 = 150 \]

So, the total amount Karan will have to pay back is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 150 = 3800 \]

Since she has to pay this amount back in equal monthly installments over five months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3800}{5} = 760 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760 per month."

"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos that Anna has. 

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total number of silver pesos and the total number of gold pesos:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of making the lemonade. The cost is given as $18.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells all of the lemonade, and she sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open:

\[ \frac{\$18}{4 \text{ hours}} = \$4.50/\text{hour} \]

Thus, the profit per hour that Millie makes running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$4.50 \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{4.50} \]"
"Let's denote the total land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he retained \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The remaining land is given as 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"First, we need to determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

Since the choir is made up of 52 members and 50% are girls, the remaining 50% must be boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 50\% \times 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
\]

So, the choir has 26 girls and 26 boys. When the choir decides to perform with just its female members, the number of female members is:

\[
\text{Number of female members} = 26
\]

On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have individually based on the given ratio and total.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). The sum of these quantities is given by:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now we can find the number of popsicles each has:

- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services he will be using.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% savings for bundling:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 a month, so together they cost $20 a month.
- With a 20% discount, the savings on Hulu and Disney Plus is 20% of $20, which is $4.
- Therefore, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

Next, we add the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month:
- The total cost of Hulu, Disney Plus, and Netflix is $16 + $10 = $26 a month.

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which was $60 a month:
- The savings by switching to streaming services is $60 - $26 = $34.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's convert all the time spent into the same unit. I'll use minutes for this calculation.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 4 hours is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends half that time recording, which is:
\[ \frac{240}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

She spends 90 minutes editing.

Now, let's add up the total time spent:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save to buy the bike, we first need to calculate the difference between the cost of the bike and the money he currently has.

The cost of the bike is $300, and Mark currently has $50. Therefore, the amount of money he still needs is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to work to earn $250, we divide the amount he needs by his daily earnings:
\[ 250 \div 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes. Since there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and there are 90 spiders:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth based on the information given.

We know Erica is 30 years old. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
\[ 12 \]"
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. Therefore, he drinks a total of 2 * 8 = 16 ounces of milk. Given that milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed by John is 16 * 3 = 48 calories. 

The final numerical answer is 48."
"To calculate the builder's earnings for a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month:**
   - The builder works 6 days a week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the builder works \(6 \times 4 = 24\) days in a month.

2. **Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - The builder works 24 days a month.
   - Therefore, the builder works \(24 \times 12 = 288\) days in a year.

3. **Calculate the builder's earnings for the year:**
   - The builder gets paid $50 every day.
   - Therefore, the builder earns \(288 \times 50 = 14400\) dollars in a year.

The final numerical answer is 14400."
"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, the amounts are:
- Flour: \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} \)
- Milk: \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} \)

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To find out how many 2-cup bags are needed for 12 cups of flour:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \]

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To find out how many 2-cup bottles are needed for 4 cups of milk:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \]

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \]

Thus, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy usage of the air conditioner under two different conditions: the original usage and the reduced usage, and then find the difference in energy usage over 30 days.

First, let's calculate the energy usage of the air conditioner under the original condition:
- The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.
- It is used for 8 hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily energy usage is \(900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day}\).

Next, let's calculate the energy usage under the reduced condition:
- The air conditioner is used for \(8 - 5 = 3\) hours a day.
- Therefore, the daily energy usage is \(900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day}\).

Now, let's find the daily energy savings:
- The daily energy savings is \(7200 \, \text{watt-hours/day} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours/day} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day}\).

Finally, let's calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
- The total energy savings over 30 days is \(4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours}\).

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
- \(135000 \, \text{watt-hours} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours}\).

Therefore, the number of kilowatt-hours of electric energy that Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane has:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each, so \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes.

Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Jane has a total of 3 zebras, so the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[88 / 3 = 29.3333\ldots\]

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, the average number of stripes is \(29.33\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[29.33\]"
"To solve this, we need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people, and then calculate the cost based on the given prices.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches are needed to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people/sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese:

\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese/sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$15.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
2. **Number of cannolis after buying more**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100
   \]
3. **Initial number of corns**: The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Since initially there are 40 cannolis, the initial number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
4. **Number of corns after buying fewer**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the new number of corns is:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60
   \]
5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis**: Now we add the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis:
   \[
   60 + 100 = 160
   \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps so far. He then took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing his total to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long and each page has 200 words, so the total number of words is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the entire book. Given that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time required to read the book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the house as soon as he finishes the book, which will take 30 minutes. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time Toby will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes until he needs to be at the airport, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May: \( 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in May: \( 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June: \( 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours} \)

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total amount paid in June: \( 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \)

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

For the first pound, the cost is $3.
For the second pound, the cost is $3 - $1.50 = $1.50 (since it's half off).

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Sally bought 4 magnets, so the cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

The total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
Total cost = $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. So, the amount of money Sally has left is:
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. The discount amount is:

\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \]

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Therefore, the total amount Tim spends is:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Thus, the total amount Tim spends is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, the number of dozens she needs to make to have 60 cookies is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know that 5% of the candles are dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Additionally, 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, 1% of the candles are dangerous and do not have the defect.

Let's denote the total number of candles as \( N = 50000 \).

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 0.05 \times N = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of dangerous candles that have the defect (smell like wet dog):
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles with defect} = 0.05 \times N = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Since the problem states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, the remaining 1% are dangerous and have the defect. Therefore, the number of dangerous candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of dangerous candles with the defect.

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{2500} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount price for each blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 discounted blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees as \( A_{\text{tall}} \), from the shortest trees as \( A_{\text{short}} \), and from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

From the problem, we know:
- Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( A_{\text{tall}} = 30 \).
- Joanne gathered half the amount from the shortest trees, so \( A_{\text{short}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Joanne gathered \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister gathered 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathered \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ A_{\text{tall}} + A_{\text{short}} + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances traveled each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the fifth day, Tom didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

For the sixth day, Tom traveled 300 kilometers:
\[ 300 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up the distances traveled each day:
\[ 200 \text{ km} + 200 \text{ km} + 200 \text{ km} + 200 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 300 \text{ km} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 200 + 200 + 200 + 240 + 0 + 300 = 1340 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 1340 \text{ km} \]"
"Let's denote the size of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches. According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Zack's locker size is \( \frac{T}{2} \) cubic inches.

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so Peter's locker size is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \) cubic inches. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{8} = 5

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into segments based on the pricing changes.

First, we calculate the cost for the first 6 months:
- The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for the first 6 months = 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost for the next 2 months is $12 per month.
- Total cost for the next 2 months = 2 months * $12/month = $24.

Then, we calculate the cost for the remaining 8 months (months 9 through 16):
- The cost for the remaining 8 months is $14 per month.
- Total cost for the remaining 8 months = 8 months * $14/month = $112.

Finally, we sum up the costs for all the segments:
- Total cost for 2 years = $48 + $24 + $112 = $184.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $184."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of both jeans:

\[ 28 + 22 = 50 \]

Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can determine the amount saved from each type of jeans. Let's denote the amount saved from the jogger jeans as \( x \) and the amount saved from the tattered jeans as \( y \). We know that:

\[ x + y = 6 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

Since the amount saved from the tattered jeans cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the distribution. The correct distribution should be:

\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

This indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the distribution:

\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct distribution should be:

\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 22 = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The correct interpretation is:

\[ x = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33 \]
\[ y = 6 - \frac{22}{3} = \frac{18}{3} - \frac{22}{3} = -\frac{4}{3} \]

The original cost of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original cost of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in cost is:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to sum the capacities of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more, making a total of 6 bird feeders. Each of her bird feeders attracts 20 birds per day, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, her bird feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day. 

So, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 6 feeders * 30 birds per feeder = 180 birds. 

The final numerical answer is 180."
"Let's break down the costs:

- The bagel costs $4.
- The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.
  - 25% of $4 is \(0.25 \times 4 = 1\).
  - Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
- The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs \(0.5 \times 4 = $2\).

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
- Soup: $5
- Bagel: $4
- Cake: $2

Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11.

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, which gives him \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.

He uses this $x to buy the ticket and has $50 left, which means the ticket costs \( x - 50 \) dollars.

Since the ticket costs $100, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 50 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"First, let's determine the number of hotdogs the caterer initially prepared. There were 36 guests, and he prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have two hotdogs each. Therefore, the caterer prepared:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hotdogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer needed to provide:

\[ 40 \text{ hotdogs} \]

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:

\[ 40 - 36 = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the number of letters in Indras' sister's name, we first calculate half of the letters in Indras' name, which is 6. Half of 6 is 3. Then, we add 4 to this number to find the number of letters in her sister's name. So, 3 + 4 = 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). Therefore, the total number of letters is 6 + 7 = 13.

The final numerical answer is 13."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Now, the items are 20% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Charlotte has to pay:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final numerical answer is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- From her allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $1."
"To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
     \]

2. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew:**
   - Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew:**
   - Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
     \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which means she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the amount of gasoline Josey needed in pints is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. This means he spent 99% of his $5. To find out how much money he had left, we calculate 1% of $5:

\[ 1\% \text{ of } \$5 = \frac{1}{100} \times 5 = \$0.05 \]

So, George had $0.05 left after buying the chips. This means he spent:

\[ \$5 - \$0.05 = \$4.95 \]

Next, we know that each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the total cost for 3 bags of chips is:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = \$1.20 \]

Since George spent $4.95 on chips, the remaining $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 must have been spent on candy bars. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he bought is:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops among his four friends. Each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

The final numerical answer is 5."
"Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have 2 pieces. Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is 20 ounces - 2 * 2.5 ounces = 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges.
Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Now, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends, which makes a total of 8 people.

So, each person will get:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Everyone will get 7 oranges. 

The final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount:

2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound:

4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00 for the onions.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00:

2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00 for the beef stock.

The total cost for the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

$8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

$12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Wayne's travel time to the theater is given as 4 minutes.
2. The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Therefore, the travel time from Bernadette's apartment is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time to arrive at the same time as Wayne.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width as follows:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 98 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, Elizabeth's total beads are:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total beads are:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Let's calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours in the oven. The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   \[
   \text{Temperature increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after 3 hours is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open.
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   So, the temperature decrease is:
   \[
   3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Therefore, the final temperature is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The house's final temperature is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"To determine how long it took James to run, we first need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

Jon's total time is:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time for the swim for James is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time for the bike for James is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time for the run for James as \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time for James equal to 180 minutes:
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Movie C is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 20."
"First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which amount to:

\[ \text{Total money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs:

- The number of glasses that can be made is \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays that can be filled is:

- The number of trays is \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

2 trays"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Joey's new score after his turn.
2. Calculate Marcy's new score after her turn.
3. Determine the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score.

First, let's calculate Joey's new score:
Joey's initial score is 214 points. He scores an additional 26 points.
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]
So, Joey's new score is 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score:
Marcy's initial score is 225 points. She scores an additional 10 points.
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]
So, Marcy's new score is 235 points.

Now, we find the difference between Joey's new score and Marcy's new score:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]
So, Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the sneakers. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.

Next, we calculate the revenue from the sneakers sold at the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale, the remaining number of sneakers sold to the department store is:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]

The department store bought these 31 sneakers for $25 each:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from both sales:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the total from the two types of packets separately and then sum them up.

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular price is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda separately is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket. This gives us the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the original cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20 \text{ balloons}} = \$45 \text{ per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \text{ per balloon} \]

Now, to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \text{ balloons} \times \$65 \text{ per balloon} = \$11050 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$11050 \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered is:
\[ 60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered is:
\[ 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance traveled is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles} \]

The total time taken for the trip is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has left after the trade. She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has 5 sapphires left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \]

Next, we calculate the value of the rubies she received in the trade. She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, and since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \]

Since the rubies are worth $1200 each, the value of the 2 rubies she received is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ 6400 \]"
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can calculate the total number of apples each of them eats in that period and then add those amounts together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ 240 \]"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required to fill all the raised beds.

Each raised bed has the dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - The total number of cards is the sum of the red, green, and yellow cards.
   - This is \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

Thus, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. After these 25 fairies joined the original 50, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75. Then, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.

The final numerical answer is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

The percentage of all the puppies that have spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 35 \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feeds to find the total weight of the feed:
\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible):
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Since 2250 pounds is exactly half of 4500 pounds, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are \(3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings by adding the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\).

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

The shark's length is 10 feet, which is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's first calculate the cost of the razors before any discounts or coupons are applied.

Each pack of razors costs $4.00 and contains 4 razors. Therefore, the cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{4.00}{4} = 1.00 \text{ dollar per razor} \]

Now, Heather is buying 2 packs of razors. Normally, this would cost:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

However, the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer. This means for every pack of 4 razors, she only pays for 2. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 4 razors:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ razors} \]

The cost for 4 razors at the regular price is:
\[ 4 \times 1.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. After applying the coupon, the cost becomes:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she is buying 4 razors, the cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{2.00}{4} = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Converting this to cents:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total height of the human pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall. 

The human pyramid consists of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the second level, 2 on the third level, and 1 at the top. 

The total height of the pyramid can be calculated as follows:

- The 4 girls on the bottom level contribute a total height of \(4 \times 64\) inches.
- The 3 girls on the second level contribute a total height of \(3 \times 64\) inches.
- The 2 girls on the third level contribute a total height of \(2 \times 64\) inches.
- The 1 girl at the top contributes a height of 60 inches.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides he made over the 14 days:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we need to find out the cost of these rides. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. Since he makes 2 rides per day, one of these rides is in the morning and the other is in the afternoon. Therefore, for each day, the cost is:
\[ 6 \text{ (morning)} + 2 \text{ (afternoon)} = 8 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 14 days:
\[ 8 \text{ dollars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to determine how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we can find the total number of oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each greek orange pie requires three oranges, so the number of pies they can make is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is:
\[ 25n + 5n = 30n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 30n \]

Let's solve this equation for \( n \):
\[ 200 = 30n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 25n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{25} \]
\[ n = 8 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 8."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Together, they used \( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \times 364 \) yards of yarn altogether.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = 273 \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we need to calculate the number of gifts for her friends and then add the additional gifts she bought for a surprise.

First, let's calculate the number of gifts for her 5 friends:
- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also bought 10 more random gifts as a surprise. Therefore, the total number of gifts she bought is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[26\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug's width is 3 + 5 = 8 feet.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug's width is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. Therefore, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The final numerical answer is 18."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). We know that Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is \( 2S \).

She also bought one pack of grape gum for $2. Let's denote the cost of the green apple gum as \( G \). According to the problem, she paid half as much for the green apple gum as she did for the grape gum, so \( G = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total amount Suzie spent is the sum of the cost of the strawberry gum and the grape gum and the green apple gum. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the cost-effectiveness of using 2 x 4 pieces of wood versus 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, he gets 200 sticks and it costs $4.
  - Cost per stick for 2 x 4 = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick.
- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, he gets 400 sticks and it costs $6.
  - Cost per stick for 2 x 8 = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood is cheaper per stick, he should use as many of these as possible.

Next, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy with $24:
- Cost of 1 2 x 8 piece of wood = $6.
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy = $24 / $6 = 4 pieces.

With 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he can make:
- 4 pieces * 400 sticks per piece = 1600 sticks.

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is 1600."
"To find the total cost, we first need to determine the total number of legs Mario's 6 sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs (and thus the total number of snowshoes needed) is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed. Since each dog requires one pair of snowshoes, Mario will need 6 pairs of snowshoes. The total cost is then:

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars/pair} = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 72 \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate her total weekly cost without the bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day and does this five days a week. Therefore, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so her total weekly cost without the bus pass is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

With the weekly bus pass costing $20, the savings per week is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Thus, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows. The zoo has 20 sheep, which is twice the number of cows on the farm. This confirms the zoo has 10 cows (since 20 sheep / 2 = 10 cows).

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has 10 sheep (since 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep).

To find the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo combined, we add the number of cows and sheep on each:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 10 cows + 20 sheep = 30 animals

Total animals = 40 (farm) + 30 (zoo) = 70 animals.

The final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following equations based on the relationship:

Let \( S_o \) be the number of onions Sophia bought, and \( S_p \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we first calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Given that he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, the total calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds is:

\[ 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has until his goal date. Andy's goal is July 19th, and today is December 31st. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is calculated as follows:

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
- January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- February has 28 days in a non-leap year, so from February 1st to December 31st is 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1st to December 31st is 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1st to December 31st is 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1st to December 31st is 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together, the total number of days is:

\[ 0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

To find the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} = 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of 553 calories. Thus, the final answer is:

\[ 553 \text{ calories/day} \]"

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 kilometers, she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 120 \text{ ml} \]"
"To find out how much money Julie has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Julie spent on clothes.
2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from her initial amount to find out how much money she has left.
3. Calculate how much she spent on CDs from the remaining money.
4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find out how much she has left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. So, the amount spent on clothes is:
\[ 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from her initial amount:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Now, Julie has $400 left. Next, we calculate how much she spent on CDs:

3. Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. So, the amount spent on CDs is:
\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house cost three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, and each pack costs $4.

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 canvas bags (8 packs × 5 bags per pack) for $8 each.

Total revenue = Number of bags × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

So, Tara earned a profit of $288."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount can be calculated as follows:

\[
4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

So, Ali has a total of $160. He gives half of this amount to his sister:

\[
\frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

After giving half to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[
160 - 80 = 80
\]

Next, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device.

First, let's calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Ada's daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour.

Next, let's calculate her daily consumption after adding the new device:
- New device's daily consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour.
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Weekly consumption before adding the new device: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts.
- Weekly consumption after adding the new device: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts.

Next, let's calculate the cost of electricity for the weekly consumption:
- Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50.
- Cost for 84 kilowatts per week: 84 kilowatts * $1.50 = $126.
- Cost for 98 kilowatts per week: 98 kilowatts * $1.50 = $147.

Finally, let's find the difference in the weekly electric bill:
- Difference in weekly bill: $147 - $126 = $21.

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person paints a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is one-fourth of a house. Therefore, the rate of one person is 1/4 of a house per day.

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint 5 * (1/4) = 5/4 of a house in one day.

To paint a whole house, they would need 1 / (5/4) = 4/5 of a day. Converting this into hours, since there are 24 hours in a day, 4/5 of a day is equal to (4/5) * 24 = 96/5 = 19.2 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, and \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has. Similarly, let \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has, and \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), which means \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation, we get \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, so the total for Ophelia is \( 20 + 22 = 42 \).
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs, so the total for Jenna is \( 64 + 66 = 130 \).

Adding these totals together, we get:
\[ 42 + 130 = 172 \]

Thus, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to first determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that the total amount Tom paid was $48, and he bought a CD for $4. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44. If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have $48 - $44 = $44 left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought with $44 is:

\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"

1. For the 6 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

2. For the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

3. For the week where he worked out 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop:
- People on the bus: \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on 3 times as many as those who got off, which is \(3 \times 21 = 63\).

So, after the second stop:
- People on the bus: \(70 - 21 + 63 = 112\).

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 112."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Jame's current age. If Jame will be 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than 60 in 8 years, which means:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

So, Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in age between Jame and his cousin. Jame is 22 years old now, and his cousin is 47 years old now. The difference in their ages is:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of the two now is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of the printer as \( P \), and the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
- The cost of the computer is $1,100.
- The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
\[ C = 1100 \]
\[ P = C - 400 \]

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, substituting the values of \( C \) and \( P \) into the total cost equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]
\[ M = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls. Since there are 20 kids in total and they are divided into two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
\[ 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is:
\[ 600 + 4 \times 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 \]

Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ \frac{840}{10} = 84 \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"

"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, Anne's age is:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]
\[81 + 45 = 126\]
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma still needs to make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we can subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal.

The total number of vlogs she has made so far is:
18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

Therefore, the number of vlogs she still needs to make is:
72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs already made) = 18 vlogs.

So, the final numerical answer is 18."
"To calculate the total amount I ended up paying, I first need to calculate the tip and then add it to the original dinner bill.

The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill. 

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total amount I paid is the original bill plus the tip:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount is $18.
   - It is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is $18 / 3 = $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share: $6 + $5 = $11.
   - The following day, he adds another $10: $11 + $10 = $21.
   - He then spends $8: $21 - $8 = $13.

3. **Saving and Tripling:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8: $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has now is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given.

First, we know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. April has 30 days, so the average daily saving target is:
\[ \frac{1125}{30} = 37.5 \]

Let's denote the number of days in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the number of days in the second half of April is \( 30 - x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, if he saves \( 37.5 \) dollars per day in the first half, he will save \( 2 \times 37.5 = 75 \) dollars per day in the second half.

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 37.5x + 75(30 - x) = 1125 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 37.5x + 2250 - 75x = 1125 \]
\[ -37.5x + 2250 = 1125 \]
\[ -37.5x = 1125 - 2250 \]
\[ -37.5x = -1125 \]
\[ x = \frac{1125}{37.5} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

This means that \( x = 15 \), so Elvis saves in the first half of April for 15 days and in the second half for 15 days. Since he saves \( 75 \) dollars per day in the second half, the amount he has to save for each day in the second half of the month is:
\[ 75 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples. Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each:
\[ 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges. Verna bought five oranges at $0.80 each:
\[ 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \]

Then, let's calculate the total cost of the peaches. Verna bought six peaches at $0.75 each:
\[ 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[ 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from $20:
\[ 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount they get together is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Jeff gets 80 dollars. 

The final numerical answer is 80."

"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Alphabet Length**: The English alphabet consists of 26 letters.

2. **First Two Full Alphabets**:
   - Elise writes the alphabet twice.
   - Therefore, the number of letters written in this step is \(26 \times 2 = 52\).

3. **Half of the Alphabet**:
   - Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
   - Half of 26 letters is \(26 / 2 = 13\).
   - Therefore, the number of letters written in this step is 13.

4. **Re-writing Everything Already Written**:
   - Elise re-writes everything she has already written.
   - This includes the two full alphabets and half of the alphabet.
   - The total number of letters already written is \(52 + 13 = 65\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times larger would be \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \) toys.

Therefore, Jonathan needs \( J + 2 \) toys to have 400 toys. This means:
\[ J + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( J \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ J = 400 - 2 \]
\[ J = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{398} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy before the discount, then apply the 10% discount, and finally sum up the discounted prices.

"Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \). According to the problem, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, which means she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee per day.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee per day.

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can only express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. But if we assume \( R \) is known, the reduction would be \( 5R - 4 \) cups. 

If we assume \( R = 4 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then Juan's current intake is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cups, and he needs to reduce it to 4 cups, which means he must reduce by \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

Therefore, the reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 16 \) cups.

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can calculate the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob. The average weight is the sum of their weights divided by the number of people, which is 3.

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \]

"To solve this, we first need to determine the ages of James' sons. The older son is 12 years old, and the younger son is 4 years younger, which means he is 8 years old.

So, the total number of candles needed is 12 (for the older son) + 8 (for the younger son) = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs to buy, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 × $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes. We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. Therefore, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, the number of pages she can read in 105 minutes is:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

- Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, his nephew is 10 years old today."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for these three teeth, she received $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since each of the previous three teeth was exchanged for $1.00, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. So, for these two teeth, she received $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, we sum up all the money Sharon received:
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00."
"To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we first need to determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information given.

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.

From the information that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Mark:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, from the information that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can calculate the number of goals scored by Anna:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing the goals scored by each:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ 175 \]"
"To determine how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate Mitchell's earnings.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. Therefore, Mitchell's total earnings can be calculated as follows:
\[
21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars/lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[
84 \text{ dollars} - 63 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday and then determine how much he has left for the rest of the week. After that, we can figure out how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the wooden action figures Peter buys from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he buys one wooden action figure each day and each wooden action figure costs $5, the total cost for these four days is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the wooden action figures from Peter's initial amount to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Peter will use the remaining $50 to buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ action figures} \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden action figures and the plastic action figures:
\[ 4 + 25 = 29 \text{ action figures} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{29} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to sum up the costs of each item:

1. Spaying the kitten costs $200.
2. The cost of 3 vaccines is $20 each, so the total cost for the vaccines is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 broken vases is $12 each, so the total cost for the vases is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[200 + 60 + 48 = 308\]

Therefore, the total cost for Leah to have her kitten spayed and to replace the broken vases is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses he grows in a week and then compare it to the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- 20 roses to the first shop
- 15 roses to the second shop
- 30 roses to the third shop

So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month is:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month, he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she removes from the account over that period and subtract it from her initial amount.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years is equivalent to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months. If she removes $100 each month, the total amount removed over 24 months is \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount:
\[3000 - 2400 = 600\]

So, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the bread and cheese/condiments. They spend $3.00 on bread per loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread. Therefore, the cost of bread is $3.00.

Next, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches. Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

Therefore, the net profit is:
\[ \boxed{37} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of crayon pieces Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayon pieces} \]

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

If she can sell each muffin for $1.50, then the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = \$2592 + \$432 = \$3024 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is \$11232."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the seven days.

On days one and two, he saw a total of 50 birds.
On day three, he saw 0 birds.
On days four and five, he saw a total of 120 birds.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds seen is:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7):
\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

So, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is 40."
"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( S \). According to the problem, \( S = 20 \).

The next step is to add half of the starting value to the starting value. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} = 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30. \]

Next, we divide this result by 5:
\[ \frac{30}{5} = 6. \]

Finally, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12:
\[ 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48. \]

Therefore, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage error in Maggie's oven's temperature setting and then apply that same percentage error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.

The difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means that the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature. Now, we need to apply this same 4% error to the 520 degrees she needs for her recipe.

To find the actual temperature that would result in a 520-degree setting, we need to adjust for the 4% error. If the actual temperature is \( T \) when the oven is set to 520 degrees, then:
\[ 520 \times (1 + 0.04) = T \]
\[ 520 \times 1.04 = T \]
\[ T = 540.8 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 540.8 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees for her recipe.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 540.8 \]"

1 hour and 30 minutes is equivalent to 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.
2 hours and 5 minutes is equivalent to 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Adding these together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, the total time Max will spend watching the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house price and subtract it from Herb's price. Herb's house is valued at $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's price gives us the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. Since Judy initially bought 12 cups, her friend brought \(40 - 12 = 28\) more cups than Judy bought.

Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy's initial 24 dishes, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Judy's total cups: \(12 + 28 = 40\)
Judy's total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of cups and dishes brought by both is \(40 + 68 = 108\).

The final numerical answer is 108."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one box of contacts after the 10% discount. The original price of one box is $100.00. A 10% discount on $100.00 is:

\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:

\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for the 2 boxes is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Jill worked. Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long as Jill on Sunday. Therefore, John worked:
\[ 2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both Jill and John. Since they are paid $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah during her workout.

For the aerobics:
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Aerobics burn 500 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

For the running:
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Running burns 600 calories per hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Given that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:
- For every 200 calories, she drinks 100 ml of water.
- For 1600 calories, the amount of water she needs to drink = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 800 ml."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \). Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500. The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \), and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"

The three measurements are 47, 52, and 57 WPM. To find the average, we sum these values and divide by 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we calculate the sum:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide the sum by 3:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{52}

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is $4 * 2 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

Thus, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}\right) \times 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly protein intake:
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

The base cost for two implants is:
\[ 2 \times \$2000 = \$4000 \]

For one of the implants, the porcelain crown adds an extra $500:
\[ \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \]

George earns $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is therefore 90 degrees. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

- Total games at the end of Year 1: 5 + 12 = 17 games

**Year 2:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought: 2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games
- Total games at the end of Year 2: 17 (from Year 1) + 5 (from parents) + 24 (bought) = 46 games

**Year 3:**
- Initial games from his parents: 5
- Games bought: 4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games
- Total games at the end of Year 3: 46 (from Year 2) + 5 (from parents) + 48 (bought) = 99 games

Additionally, Steve receives 5 games for Christmas each year. Over three years, he receives:
- 5 games for Christmas in Year 1

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time. Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We can find this by dividing the additional distance by the speed:

\[ \text{Additional time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the plane would take an additional 5 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Ruiz as follows:

\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we can calculate the hourly rate for Marissa as follows:

\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa make together in 12 hours. First, we calculate the total amount Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the totals together to find the combined total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spends at the arcade over the three days and then subtract that from his initial amount of $100.

On Monday, Howard spends $8.
On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Subtracting the total amount spent from his initial amount of $100 gives:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate the earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

The total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the first 4 hours are:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30 \]

Next, for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

The total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours is:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The total earnings from the next 2 hours are:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations for 400 miles as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total rotations for 400 miles} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations for a month:

\[ \text{Total rotations for a month} = 400 \times \frac{725}{2} = 200 \times 725 = 145000 \]

Now, we know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months the tires can last, we divide the total number of rotations a tire can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000}{145000} = 72 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can now find out how many years the tires can last:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{72}{12} = 6 \]

So, the tires can last for 6 years before they need to be replaced. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo. Given that the bottle gives 120 washes with 2 pumps, we can calculate the cost per wash and then per pump.

The cost of the bottle is $24.00, and it gives 120 washes. So, the cost per wash is:

\[ \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\$24.00}{120 \text{ washes}} = \$0.20 \text{ per wash} \]

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash, which is $0.20. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ \$0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents."
"First, let's calculate the sale price of the shirt. The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the sale price of the shorts. The shorts originally cost $35, and there is a 30% discount.

The discount amount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the sale price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the sale prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the amount of butter needed for one day:**
   - It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
   - Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.
   - Therefore, the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants in one day is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \text{ pound}
     \]

2. **Determine the total amount of butter needed for a week:**
   - Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for the week is:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$94660 \]

The difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street is:
\[ \$94660 - \$29100 = \$65560 \]

So, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ \$65560 \]

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 5 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - The remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months) are funded at 50% more per month than the initial $100,000 per 5 months.
   - Cost per month for the extended period: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month.
   - Cost per month for the extended period at 50% more: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.
   - Total cost for the extended 45 months: $30,000 * 45 months = $1,350,000.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the initial and extended funding: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to sum the meat consumed by each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so he ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, he ate 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not eat any meat.

Now, we add the meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to calculate the number of days in March and then multiply it by the average number of posts per day per member.

March has 31 days. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. Therefore, the total number of posts per day for all members is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March:

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is 93,000."
"To calculate how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Calculate the total gallons of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

First, Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost of the water used in a year is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed During School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 4 pieces of gum during school (8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces).

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Gum Given to His Sister**: After dinner, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Let's calculate the remaining gum before giving some to his sister.

   - After chewing 4 pieces during school, 1 piece on the way home, and 1 piece after dinner, Jim has chewed a total of 6 pieces.
   - Therefore, the remaining gum is 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.
   - After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

So, the final number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is 7."

"To calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
2. Convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour.

First, we convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per second by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per second.

Ashley's speed in kb per second is 20. So, her speed in Mb per second is:
\[ \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb per second} \]

Next, we convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb per second by 3600 to get the speed in Mb per hour.

"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining four days of the week. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
on each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days to the number of cars towed on the remaining four days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Adam's height in feet is:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) by \(\frac{1}{6}\):

\[ \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 cars James sold:

\[ \text{Total cost of cars} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, so the cost the company paid is:

\[ \text{Cost paid by the company} = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made from selling the cars is the total revenue minus the cost paid by the company:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits:

\[ \text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
2. Calculate the number of these riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright to find the number of men who can stay upright.

First, we know that only 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, we know that 60% of these 25 riders are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is the total number of riders who can stay upright minus the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the price of a diamond jewel as \( D \), the price of a gold jewel as \( G \), and the price of a silver jewel as \( S \).

Given:
- \( D = $2000 \)
- The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, so \( G = \frac{4}{5}D \).
- The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so \( S = G - 400 \).

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \( $4800 \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

\[
16 \text{ (snowflake stamps)} + 19 \text{ (truck stamps)} + 10 \text{ (rose stamps)} = 45
\]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead and Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can calculate the time it will take for Tom to close the gap.

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds, which is \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour. This means Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
2. Now, since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, and Darren caught 11 fish, Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class if the total cost exceeds $10 per class.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 10 classes:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per class if the total cost is more than $10 per class. Let's denote the cost per class as \( x \). If the total cost is more than $10 per class, then:
\[ 10 < x \]

Given that the total cost is $60 for 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ x = \frac{60}{10} = \$6 \]

Since $6 is less than $10, the condition that the cost per class must be more than $10 is not met. Therefore, Manny's parents will not sign him up again based on the given condition.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before the total cost exceeds $10 per class, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend such that the cost per class is still less than $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can attend as \( n \). The total cost for \( n \) classes is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 60 \]

The cost per class for \( n \) classes is:
\[ x = \frac{60}{n} \]

We need:
\[ \frac{60}{n} < 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 < 10n \]
\[ n > 6 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, the maximum number of classes Manny can attend such that the cost per class is less than $10 is 5. Therefore, the number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 5 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10, and his parents will not sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to find out how many customers each of them processes in a day.

Given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers Julie processes per day as follows:
\[ \text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by each of them in a week (7 days):
\[ \text{Jewel's weekly customers} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 100 \times 7 = 700 \]

Finally, we add the weekly customers processed by both Julie and Jewel to find the total weekly production:
\[ \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Jewel's weekly customers} + \text{Julie's weekly customers} = 350 + 700 = 1050 \]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[ \boxed{1050} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Reggie ran. Since Paisley ran 4 miles and Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, we calculate:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can find out how many miles Lynn ran by subtracting 3 miles from Reggie's total distance:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given that four apples cost $5.20, the cost of one apple is:
\[ \text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

Given that three oranges cost $3.30, the cost of one orange is:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \(T\) required is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 216 \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base price of the truck:** $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade:** $7,500
3. **Leather seats:** One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. **Running boards:** $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. **Upgraded exterior light package:** $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is **$43,500**."

   \]

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150
   \]
   James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
   \]

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800

"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes and then sum them up.

The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily. Similarly, for 28 days in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Adding the articles published by both websites gives us the total number of articles published in February:

"First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula for distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa, the speed is 12 miles per hour and the time is 4.5 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked. The speed for Stanley is 10 miles per hour and the time is 2.5 hours. So,

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add the distances together:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.

The time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance through soil}}{\text{Rate through soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the rate through soil, which is 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.

The time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance through clay}}{\text{Rate through clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum the times to get the total time to dig the well:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time through soil} + \text{Time through clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:

"Let's denote the total sales from green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half of the total sales from green hats. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total sales from green hats in the first month were $800. The total sales in the first month, \( T_1 \), is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ T_1 = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, the sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ T_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

The total sales in the two months is the sum of the sales from the first and second months:

\[ T_{\text{total}} = T_1 + T_2 = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"

"Let's denote the cooking time for rice as \( R \), for beans as \( B \), and for pork as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took Finley 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The cooking time for beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) \).

First, we calculate \( P \):
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}(R + P) = \frac{1}{2}(30 + 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total cooking time for all the food:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

First, we know that each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. The total number of legs is given as 70. Therefore, we can write the equation for the legs as:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

Second, we know that each animal has one head. The total number of heads is given as 20. Therefore, we can write the equation for the heads as:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

To solve this system, we can start by simplifying the first equation. We can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( 2S + G = 35 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( G \):
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15. To find the number of geese \( G \), we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

To find the cost of the more expensive brand:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = \text{Cost of normal brand} + (\text{Cost of normal brand} \times 20\%) \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + (5 \times 0.20) \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 5 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive brand} = 6 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week. Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, and he needs coffee for 7 days:
\[ \text{Total coffee cost} = 7 \times \text{Cost of more expensive brand} \]
\[ \text{Total coffee cost} = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Total coffee cost} = 42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total coffee cost} + \text{Cost of donut} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 44 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

The total amount spent is $20.00.

The cost of the 2 bag of chips is $2.00 each, so 2 bags cost $2.00 * 2 = $4.00.

The cost of the bucket of fried chicken is $8.00.

The cost of the bottle of soda is $1.00.

So, the total cost of the items Gus bought is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Subtracting the total cost of the items from the total amount spent gives us the cost of the apple pie:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

So, the calculation is as follows:

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered in a day - Newspapers delivered to District A - Newspapers delivered to District C

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 198 - 209 = 193

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours John attends.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total class hours.

First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks. Therefore, the total number of class hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, the number of recipes he learns is:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ \text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each person has and then share the total equally.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:
\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share this total amount equally among the three of them, each person would get:
\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we will break down the problem step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he has 1 toy per dog.

1. **First Purchase:**
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - James needs 1 toy per dog.
   - Therefore, he needs 8 more toys.
   - Total toys after the first purchase: \(4 + 8 = 12\).

2. **Second Purchase:**
   - James went back to see that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - When he left, there were 8 more dogs.
   - Twice as many more dogs: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) more dogs.
   - James needs 1 toy per dog.
   - Therefore, he needs 16 more toys.
   - Total toys after the second purchase: \(12 + 16 = 28\).

3. **Third Purchase:**
   - When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone.
   - James no longer needs the toys for these 3 dogs.
   - Therefore, he needs to subtract 3 toys.
   - Total toys after the third purchase: \(28 - 3 = 25\).

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is 25."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the total investment is $1200.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount:
\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Frances then invests 2/3 of the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

Skyler's investment is the rest of the amount:
\[ \text{Skyler's investment} = 240 \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240."

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

Jack's weight: 80 kg
Weight of 8 other adults: 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg

Total weight: Jack's weight + Weight of 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg.

To find out by how much they will have exceeded the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
Exceeding load = Total weight - Maximum load
Exceeding load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is 20 kg."
"Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

Given that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so:
\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each of them has:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ 298 \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she adds \( 0.5x \) to the original length. Then she adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation for the final length as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing half of his lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the time he spent mowing the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's convert the time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode to minutes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half of the lawn in each mode:
- In ""turtle"" mode, to mow half of the lawn, it would take half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, to mow half of the lawn, it would take half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent in each mode to find the total time:
- Time spent in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time spent in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes."

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the equation:

\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

We also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can write another equation:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now we substitute \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:

\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets (\( Tr = 6 \)), we can find the age of one of the twins (\( T \)):

\[ T = Tr + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is 13. Let's confirm this by checking the combined ages:

\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 13 + 13 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 44 \]

The combined ages are indeed 44, so the solution is correct. The final numerical answer is:

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap, we subtract the total homework time from the total time he has before dinner:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Let's first determine the cost of the candies. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of the five lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Therefore, in ten years (which is 120 months), Rong will have saved:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins/month} \right) = 20 \text{ coins/month} + 8 \text{ coins/month} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In ten years (which is 120 months), Neil will have saved:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins saved by Rong and Neil over ten years, we get:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and John needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( H \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Therefore, we have:
\[ H = 0.6T \]
Since the total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check, we can write:
\[ T = 40 + H \]
Substituting \( H = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \), we get:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]
To isolate \( T \), we subtract \( 0.6T \) from both sides:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
Solving for \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

\[ \text{Cost of one banana} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. Since oranges cost three times as much as a banana, we have:
\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the fruits in one crate. The crate contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. Therefore, the total cost for the bananas, apples, and oranges are:
\[ \text{Total cost for bananas} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for apples} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for oranges} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total price for the crate:
\[ \text{Total price for the crate} = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To find the total number of square feet of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to determine the number of each colored square and then calculate the total area.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Number of red squares = 14

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4
   - Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6
   - Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

4. **White Squares:**
   - Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12
   - Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Now, we sum up the total number of squares:
- Total number of squares = Number of red squares + Number of blue squares + Number of green squares + Number of white squares
- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares:
- Total area = 68 square feet

3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are \(65 - 30 = 35\) points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points are \(35 \times 3 = 105\) points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by Adam, Betty, Tom, and Marta:

\[50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:

\[400 - 255 = 145\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[145\]"
"To determine the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we need to follow the lineage step by step.

1. **Great Grandma Jones has three children.**
   - Number of children = 3

2. **Each of her children has three children of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren.**
   - Number of grandchildren per child = 3
   - Total number of grandchildren = Number of children * Number of grandchildren per child = 3 * 3 = 9

3. **Each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.**
   - Number of great grand-babies per grandchild = 3
   - Total number of great grand-babies = Number of grandchildren * Number of great grand-babies per grandchild = 9 * 3 = 27

Therefore, if all of the family show up at the family reunion, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"To find out how much money Greta has left to spend, we need to calculate how much she puts into her retirement account and how much she pays for her car, and then subtract these amounts from her total paycheck.

First, let's calculate how much she puts into her retirement account:
\[ \text{Amount for retirement} = 50\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.50 \times \$2400.00 = \$1200.00 \]

Next, let's calculate how much she pays for her car:
\[ \text{Amount for car payment} = 20\% \times \$2400.00 = 0.20 \times \$2400.00 = \$480.00 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts she puts into her retirement account and the amount she pays for her car from her total paycheck:
\[ \text{Amount left to spend} = \$2400.00 - \$1200.00 - \$480.00 = \$720.00 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:
\[ \$720.00 \]

Let's confirm this with a final numerical answer in a separate line:

"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we first need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. Given that the box can hold 20 pencils and 4 are missing, we can calculate the number of pencils currently in the box as follows:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is:

\[ 8 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the display:

3 boxes of 5 fireworks each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ fireworks} \]

Now, we need to determine how many of these fireworks Hannah will see. She will see 40% of the total display:

\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \text{ fireworks} \]

Adding the fireworks set off in her backyard:

\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. Therefore, the total number of people is:

\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person will have a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since each drink and each snack costs $2, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks for one person:

\[ \text{Cost for one person} = 2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2/\text{drink} + 3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2/\text{snack} = 4 + 6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for drinks and snacks for the entire group is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10/\text{person} = \$200 \]

Thus, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( G \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, we solve for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

"If each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, then the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:

\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, the final numerical answer is 50."
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia received from the $100 division in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Gerald's share is 3 parts out of 5, so:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = \frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60 \]

Julia's share is 2 parts out of 5, so:
\[ \text{Julia's share} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so the amount of money he has left is:
\[ \text{Gerald's remaining money} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to find the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Given that the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

\[ \text{Turtle's distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the goal of $6300, given that $2100 has already been raised in the first 3 hours and that the amount raised per hour is constant.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Amount raised per hour}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Thus, the total number of hours required to reach the goal is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city. Since Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, this is our starting point.
2. Determine the percentage of the water used by the city that is used for industrial purposes. We know that 80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes.
3. Calculate the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. This can be found by subtracting the percentage used for industrial purposes from the percentage used by the city.

Let's do the calculation:

1. The city uses 40% of the river's total water.
2. 80% of the 40% used by the city is for industrial purposes, which is \(0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%\).
3. The remaining percentage used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(40\% - 32\% = 8\%\).

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the production rate for each flavor.

For chocolate ice cream:
- 100 quarts in 2 hours means the factory makes 50 quarts per hour.

For vanilla ice cream:
- 50 quarts in 4 hours means the factory makes 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production for 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts.

Final bill = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00."
"To solve this, let's first understand the deal: for every 2 scoops of ice cream bought, Erin gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 3 scoops of ice cream, she only pays for 2.

Each scoop costs $1.50, so for 2 scoops, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many scoops she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost of 2 scoops:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. Therefore, she can get a total of 3 scoops of ice cream for $6.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks compared to Ginger, we need to calculate the amount of candy each of them consumes over that period.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with tiles. This is two thirds of the total bathroom area.
2. Multiply the area that needs to be covered by the number of tiles required per square foot.

Let's start with the first step:

The total area of the bathroom is 36 sq ft. Two thirds of this area is:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, for the second step, we know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot. Therefore, the total number of tiles needed is:
\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 576 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries. The cost to go picking is $20, and the cost per pound is $1.5. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store. The price per pound at the store is $2.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved compared to buying at the store, we subtract the cost James incurred from the cost of buying at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original price of each computer.
2. Calculate the new price of each computer after a 10% increase.
3. Compute the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.

First, let's find the original price of each computer. The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. Therefore, the original price per computer is:
\[ \text{Original price per computer} = \frac{700}{500} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the new price after a 10% increase. A 10% increase means the new price is 110% of the original price. So, the new price per computer is:
\[ \text{New price per computer} = 1.40 \times 1.10 = 1.54 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 500 \times 1.54 = 770 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to sum the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, we calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg is 75 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

Next, we calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 oz of cheese.
- Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Then, we calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses 2 oz of ham.
- Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
- Therefore, the total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Finally, we sum the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:
- Total calories = 450 calories (eggs) + 240 calories (cheese) + 80 calories (ham) = 770 calories.

The total number of calories in the omelet is 770 calories."

"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for both scenarios: when her arms are raised and when they are at her sides.

First, let's calculate the taps when her arms are at her sides:
- Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are at her sides: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute.
- Total time with arms at her sides: 5 minutes.
- Total taps with arms at her sides: \(550 \times 5 = 2750\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the taps when her arms are raised:
- Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
- Total taps per minute when arms are raised: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute.
- Total time with arms raised: 2 minutes.
- Total taps with arms raised: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps.

Now, we add the total taps from both scenarios:
- Total taps: \(2750 + 800 = 3550\) taps.

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{3550}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then compare it to the potential damage to his car.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt:
- Ron needs 3 buckets of asphalt.
- Each bucket costs $25.

\[
\text{Total cost of asphalt} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we add the fine he would have to pay if the city council refuses to fix it:
- The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.

\[
\text{Total cost if Ron doesn't fix the pothole} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the cost of the asphalt to the fine to find the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:

\[
\text{Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole} = 75 + 120 = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

The potential damage to his car is $450. Therefore, the savings by fixing the pothole is the difference between the potential damage and the total cost if he fixes it himself:

\[
\text{Savings} = 450 - 195 = 255 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole is:

\[

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the number of normal chairs left and the number of baby chairs left to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:
- Normal chairs left: 150
- Baby chairs left: 10
- Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of slices of pizza. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the remaining two friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:
\[ 5 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

However, we need to be careful here. The two friends who ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas are the same two friends who ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. So, we need to subtract the slices they already ate from the total slices they were supposed to eat to avoid double-counting.

The total slices eaten by the two friends who ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas is 40. The total slices they were supposed to eat is 45. Therefore, the slices they actually ate beyond the 40 is:
\[ 45 - 40 = 5 \]

So, the total slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 40 + 5 = 45 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is:
\[ 60 - 45 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Therefore, the time it takes the dog to eat nine sausages is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 20 minutes. The average time is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time taken by cat} + \text{Time taken by dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
25 \text{ minutes}

"First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Topher's shoe length is:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. Let's confirm this by substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 9(10) + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 \]

The equation holds true, so the length of one of Bobby's shoes is indeed \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Now, we sum the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars:
\[

"To find the percentage of blue spools, we first need to calculate the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The total number of blue spools (light blue and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, the percentage of her spools that are blue is 40%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up.

By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means that by midday, 3000 people had not voted (since 5000 - 2000 = 3000).

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. The remaining people by 16:00 are 3000 (since 5000 - 2000 = 3000). So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

This means that by 16:00, 1000 people had not voted (since 3000 - 2000 = 1000).

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in that period.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he will chew:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need to get 120 pieces. Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. So, the number of packs required is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Thus, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed. There are 9 kids and 6 adults, and each wants 2 smores. So, the total number of smores needed is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores. Therefore, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves of graham crackers, they will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Dora's father's age.
2. Determine Dora's mother's age.
3. Sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora's age is 15 years. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
Substituting Dora's age:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]
So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can express Dora's mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
Substituting the father's age:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]
So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

"First, let's calculate the total weight of Cindy's math and science books. Since each of these books weighs 2 pounds and there are two of them, the total weight of the math and science books is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the weight of her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. So, the total weight of her French and English books is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, her history book weighs:

\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all her books to find the total weight she is carrying:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 7 \text{ pounds (French and English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[ 17 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, the number of votes candidate B received is:

\[ 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of votes. The total number of votes is 100, so:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck is:

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

And the number of apples Beck has after receiving 10 apples from Boris is:

\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange. We subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[
\text{Difference} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[
3

"To determine how much water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 0.5 = 4 ounces.

Now, we sum up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water is left:
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is 2."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, Steven has half the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[
\text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the two amounts to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money she spent is:

\[
\boxed{98}

"Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as \( V \) and the number of students who like to play music as \( M \).

Given that 10 students like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or play music, we can write the total number of students as:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Therefore:

\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( M = 10 \) into the total number of students equation:

\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, 1/3 of the 12 birds were scared away. 

To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate 1/3 of 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. This means that the number of birds remaining in the backyard after the stone was thrown is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard now is:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 40 students are boys. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, 60% of the students in each class are boys. We can calculate the number of boys in each class by finding 60% of 40.

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 \times \frac{60}{100} = 40 \times 0.6 = 24 \]

So, the number of boys in each class is 24. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"

\[13 - 5 = 8\]

So, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. 

The total number of animals is:
8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days of the week, and there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals per day

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred. He bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each, so the total cost is:

So, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To calculate the savings, we first need to determine the total cost for each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $26 = $52.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $12 = $24.
- The total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for 2 adults is 2 * $14 = $28.
- The cost for 2 children is 2 * $10 = $20.
- The total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the total costs of the two parks:
- Savings = $76 - $48 = $28.

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost per day before the switch:
- He used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $0.5 each.
- Cost per day before = 500 * $0.5 = $250.

Next, let's calculate the cost per day after the switch:
- He now buys 500 tomatoes a day at $0.4 each.
- Cost per day after = 500 * $0.4 = $200.

Now, we find the daily savings:
- Daily savings = Cost per day before - Cost per day after = $250 - $200 = $50.

Finally, we calculate the weekly savings:
- Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7 days = $50 * 7 = $350.

Thus, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of marbles each person has based on the information provided.

First, we know that Sean has 56 marbles. According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:
\[
\text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups of equal size.

First, we start with the total number of students, which is 54. If we divide these students into 12 groups, we can find the number of students per group by performing the division:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it's clear that 54 students cannot be evenly divided into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the question is asking how many more groups are needed to form, implying that the current number of groups (6) is insufficient for the activity to be divided into 12 groups.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the current number of groups from the required number of groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental numbers for weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- Weekday rental: 60 chairs per day
- Weekend rental: 100 chairs per day

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- In one 4-week month, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays: \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs
- Total chairs rented during weekends: \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month: \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months: \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"First, let's calculate the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses sent is \(8 \times 12 = 96\).
- He sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates sent is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we subtract the broken items from the total sent:

- The number of glasses Jeff has now is \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- The number of plates Jeff has now is \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates:

- Total number of glasses and plates = \(86 + 42 = 128\).

So, the final numerical answer is 128."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, 27 small stickers are traded for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - 10% of 30 small stickers = 0.1 * 30 = 3 small stickers remain.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, 20 large stickers are traded for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers remain.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small buttons, 20 large buttons are traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 27 large buttons from trading small stickers.
   - Lorraine has 20 large buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Lorraine has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.
   - Total buttons = 27 + 20 + 60 = 107.

Therefore, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 107."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast in the council is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need this size.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is \(2 \times 11 = 22\).
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is \(22 - 4 = 18\).
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).
5. **Extra-Large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is 75."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first need to determine the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, the final price after the discount is $133."

20% of 50 people is:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win. 

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. 

60% of 40 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win. 

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. 

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

Furthermore, one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}P = \frac{2}{9}P \).

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{9}P = 6
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{9}{2} \):

\[
P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27
\]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"First, let's determine how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him half of her allowance.

Jayden's sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Adding this to the $70 Jayden already had, we get:
\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \). According to the problem, the first house needs half of the second house, so the first house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house will need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250
\]

\[
\frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2/5:

\[
x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house, needing double the first house, will need:

\[
2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \text{ cases}
\]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to calculate how many pears he has. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, the final numerical answer is 490."

"To make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 times the amount of oranges required for 1 liter. Therefore, he would need 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges. Given that each kilogram of oranges costs $3, the total cost would be 20 * $3 = $60. 

The final numerical answer is $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour. Therefore, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read. 

Ahmed's books read in one hour = 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra read is:
Ezra's total books = 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Now, to find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the number of books Ezra read:
Total books read = Ahmed's books + Ezra's total books = 150 + 450 = 600 books.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Next, calculate the additional earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} > 3 \text{ classes} \]
\[ 4 \text{ classes} - 3 \text{ classes} = 1 \text{ extra class} \]
\[ 1 \text{ extra class} \times \$5 = \$5 \]

So, the total earnings for Monday are:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not earn the additional $5 per day since she does not teach more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

So, the total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

**Total earnings for the two days:**
\[ \$305 \text{ (Monday)} + \$60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching."

2. Determine the time spent on reading.
3. Calculate the remaining time after reading.
4. Determine the time spent on video games.
5. Calculate the time spent on soccer.
6. Convert the time spent on soccer into a percentage of the total weekend hours.

Let's start with the total number of hours over the weekend:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

After reading, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the time spent on soccer:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the time spent on soccer into a percentage of the total weekend hours:

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives back at the same speed, the time to drive back is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many wheels Henry will have left after assembling all the cars and motorcycles, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
- He needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(4 \times 57 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
- He needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(2 \times 73 = 146\) wheels.

Adding the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles together gives:
- Total wheels needed = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the cars and motorcycles, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels Henry has:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

Thus, the number of wheels left is 276."

Mike has a total of 600 movies. 

1. A third of the movies are in various series. 
   - Number of series movies: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost for these series movies: \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \)

2. The remaining movies are:
   - \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies

3. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 400 \times 0.4 = 160 \)
   - Cost for these older movies: \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \)

4. The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   - Number of normal movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by both driving and hiking.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average of 50 miles per hour, half of that speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. The distance they hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour. The distance they drove is:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to their vacation spot is:

"Let's denote Emma's score as \( E \) and Ava's score as \( A \).

Ava's score is calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times (8 + x) \) where \( x \) is the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times (3 + y) \) where \( y \) is the number of berries Emma collects.
- Points for time: \( 30 \times (t + 4) \) where \( t \) is the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

So, Ava's score is:
\[ A = 10 \times (8 + x) + 5 \times (3 + y) + 30 \times (t + 4) \]

Emma's score is:
\[ E = 10 \times x + 5 \times y + 30 \times t \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ A - E = 10 \times (8 + x) + 5 \times (3 + y) + 30 \times (t + 4) - (10 \times x + 5 \times y + 30 \times t) \]
\[ A - E = 10 \times 8 + 10 \times x + 5 \times 3 + 5 \times y + 30 \times t + 30 \times 4 - 10 \times x - 5 \times y - 30 \times t \]
\[ A - E = 80 + 15 + 15 + 30 \times 4 \]
\[ A - E = 80 + 15 + 15 + 120 \]
\[ A - E = 230 \]

The difference between their two scores is 230 points."

"Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that the total number of fish he bought from the pet store is \( o + w = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify this equation:

\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]

We also have the equation from the total number of fish bought:

\[ o + w = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( o - 2w = 5 \)
2. \( o + w = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):

\[ o = 17 - w \]

Now substitute this expression for \( o \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - w - 2w = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3w = 5 \]
\[ -3w = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3w = -12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o + w = 17 \):

\[ o + 4 = 17 \]
\[ o = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \( 4 \). The final numerical answer is:

   - Therefore, the round trip distance (to and from work) is \(5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles}\).
   - Total distance driven in a week is \(10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of gas consumed in a week:**
   - Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - Therefore, the amount of gas consumed in a week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3/gallon.
   - Therefore, the cost of the gas consumed in a week is \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in quarters. Since she has 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount in quarters is:

\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie has in twenties. Since she has 10 twenties and each twenty is worth $20, the total amount in twenties is:

- Therefore, the total yield from the tomato plants is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total yield from the eggplant plants is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) eggplants.

Now, we add the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants to find the total number of fruits:
- The total number of fruits is \(110 + 32 = 142\).

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total sales.

Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we can calculate the number of smart TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Similarly, one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so:

"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work. She earns $20 per hour for regular hours.

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional hours she worked, which is 11 - 8 = 3 hours. She is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate for these additional hours. Her regular hourly rate is $20, so her special hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 150\% \times \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her pay for the additional 3 hours:

\[ \text{Special pay} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add her regular pay and her special pay to find her total pay for the day:

\[ \text{Total pay} = \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on last Tuesday."
"To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to calculate the number of male lions and then add all the counts together.

The number of female lions is given as 12. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[ 32 \]"
"To find out how much money Mike will have left over after purchasing the jeans, we first need to calculate the discounted price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10.00. To find the sale price of the jeans, we subtract the discount from the original price:

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from $50.00:

\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total salary paid to all employees after three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of employees after three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. After three months, the number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees after three months.**

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to 260 employees per month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{1040000} \]"
"To find the total time they will be caroling, we need to add the duration of ""Deck the Halls"" twice and the duration of ""Jingle Bells"" once.

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so twice it will be:
\[ 150 \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

Adding these together:
\[ 300 + 240 = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Billy's starting salary and his salary after the raises.

1. **Billy's starting salary:**
   - Initially, Billy was paid $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, so his new hourly rate was $10.50.
   - On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, so his final hourly rate was $11.50.

2. **Billy's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - At $11.50 per hour, for 20 hours, Billy earns $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Next, let's determine Sally's starting salary. Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which was $10 per hour. Therefore, Sally's starting salary is $10.50 per hour.

3. **Sally's earnings for 20 hours:**
   - At $10.50 per hour, for 20 hours, Sally earns $10.50 * 20 = $210.

4. **Difference in earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally for 20 hours is $230 - $210 = $20.

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:

\[

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 2 bagels is:
\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost 4 dollars more than 2 bagels. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we first need to calculate Nikita's score based on the information given.

Pierson's score is 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. So, we first calculate half of Pierson's score:

\[
\frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Then, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:

\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:

\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:

\[
\boxed{428}

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of students in the school:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[1000 \times 1 = 1000\]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[120 \times 2 = 240\]

Finally, the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers is:
\[1000 + 240 = 1240\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[
\boxed{1240}

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. She has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

So, Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding the right side gives:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris has already played.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the first car:
- The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the second car:
- The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
- In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[
\text{Separation} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium is added. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. Therefore, the total cost before the premium is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1170 \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it is \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%.

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested:

- Third graders: 340 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 passed.
- Fifth graders: \( 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \) passed.

The total number of students who passed is \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \).

The total number of students tested is \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \).

The overall pass rate is \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let's denote the length of the mosaic by \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Dale initially had 100 candies and sold 150, which means he is short by 50 candies. He then ordered 100 more candies. Therefore, the total number of candies he has now is 100 (initial) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies. Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **Number of students at the end of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
3. **Number of students at the end of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
4. **Number of students at the end of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
5. **Number of students at the end of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
6. **Number of students at the end of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find the number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year. This can be calculated as the number of students at the end of May minus the initial number of students:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to determine the total number of branches he climbed during the week. We know that he made $105 and that each branch costs $0.25.

First, we calculate the total number of branches he climbed:
\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed per day. Assuming he worked every day of the week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:
\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{7} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

"Let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picks and then subtract the petals of the flowers she drops.

First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add up all the petals she initially picks:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each of the 4 types she picked, so she drops:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ flowers} \]

The total number of petals of the flowers she drops is:
\[ 1 \times 5 + 1 \times 6 + 1 \times 4 + 1 \times 7 = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the total gives:

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they use 18 marshmallows. Since the bag originally had 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores, the number of marshmallows left is:

\[ 35 - 18 = 17 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows lost is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, John and DeSean can each have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's determine the total play time for each person. Jack plays for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. His two friends who are worse than him can play for half as long as Jack, which is 120 minutes each. The friend who is significantly better can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 360 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total play time for all four friends:
- Jack: 240 minutes
- Friend 1 (worse): 120 minutes
- Friend 2 (worse): 120 minutes
- Friend 3 (better): 360 minutes

Total play time = 240 + 120 + 120 + 360 = 840 minutes.

Since each game lasts 20 minutes and costs 1 quarter, the total number of quarters used is:
\[ \frac{840 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/game}} = 42 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 42 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
3. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can say \( S = F = C \).

Now, we can express the total amount of ingredients in terms of \( S \):
- Salt \( S \)
- Oil \( O = 2S \)
- Fragrance \( F = S \)
- Citrus zest \( C = S \)
- Sugar \( G = S \)

The total amount of ingredients is:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = S + 2S + S + S + S = 6S \]

We know that the total amount of ingredients is 10 ounces:
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{10}{3} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money John spent, we need to add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has initially as follows:
\[ \text{Joe's initial cars} = 2 \times \text{Robert's cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars he sells, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cars sold by Joe} = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe has:
\[ \text{Cars Joe has after selling} = 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Then, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:
\[ \text{Cars given to his mother} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has:
\[ \text{Cars Joe has after giving} = 32 - 16 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount of money raised by the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, so we divide $125,000 by 20:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days in minutes.

First, let's determine the time Sandy spent walking on the first day. According to the problem, she walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we need to find out how much time she spent walking on the second day. The problem states that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time spent walking on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time spent walking on both days to find the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert the total hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"To determine how much John makes in a week, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate his daily earnings:
- John does 30 cycles of work a day.
- Each cycle has 5 different tasks.
- Each task pays $1.20.

So, the earnings per cycle are:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00/\text{cycle} \]

Now, his daily earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
4. To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from the first game to the points from the second game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins. Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]
Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]
So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each color of eggs Cindy has:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: twice as many as green eggs, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Pink eggs: one fewer than blue eggs, so \(10 - 1 = 9\)
- Yellow eggs: one-third as many as pink eggs, so \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\)

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Total eggs = Green eggs + Blue eggs + Pink eggs + Yellow eggs
- Total eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3\)

Let's calculate the sum:

\[
5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
\]

So, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be shipped 20 miles away.

The cost for the weight of the book is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60 \]

Adding these together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the refundable portion of the book's purchase price. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price. The book cost $32, so the refundable amount is:
\[ 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00 \]

The loss Milly will incur is the total shipping cost minus the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:
\[ \$3.00 - \$24.00 = -\$21.00 \]

Since the loss cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:
\[ \$21.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Mulan has before making any purchases:

- Initial amount: $40
- Amount given by her father: $100

Total amount before purchases = $40 + $100 = $140

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the items she bought:

- Two pairs of jeans at $30 each: 2 * $30 = $60
- A bag for $20

Total cost of purchases = $60 + $20 = $80

Finally, let's calculate how much money Mulan has left after her purchases:

Money left = Total amount before purchases - Total cost of purchases
Money left = $140 - $80 = $60

The final numerical answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time she spends on TikTok videos each week:
- Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
- Therefore, the total time spent on TikTok videos each week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends writing songs each week:
- Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
- Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time she spends on makeup each week:
- Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
- Therefore, the total time spent on makeup each week is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup each week:
- Total time spent each week is \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent in a month is:
- \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- \(1128 \div 60 = 18.8\) hours.

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 18.8 hours."
"To calculate the cost for Angela, we need to break down the cost into two parts: the base cost and the additional cost for the extra items.

First, let's calculate the base cost. The base cost includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost for this base installation is $129.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the additional items Angela needs. She has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be installed. The cost for each additional item is $15.00.

The number of additional shelves Angela needs is \(6 - 4 = 2\), the number of additional chandeliers is \(2 - 1 = 1\), and the number of additional pictures is \(20 - 10 = 10\).

So, the cost for the additional items is calculated as follows:
\[2 \text{ shelves} \times \$15.00/\text{shelf} + 1 \text{ chandelier} \times \$15.00/\text{chandelier} + 10 \text{ pictures} \times \$15.00/\text{picture} = 2 \times 15 + 1 \times 15 + 10 \times 15 = 30 + 15 + 150 = \$195.00\]

Adding the base cost and the additional cost gives us the total cost:
\[\$129.00 + \$195.00 = \$324.00\]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Eva has saved. According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, we calculate how much money Anthony has saved. The problem states that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, Anthony's savings can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Now, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{42.00}

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the lifting capacities of the individuals step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity from inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} = \frac{480}{12} \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \text{ feet} \]"
"To calculate the total distance Mason has traveled, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, we calculate the distance he traveled in the second part of his journey:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of animals, their speed, and the time it takes for them to cross the highway.

First, let's establish the speed and time relationship for the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can say that the total ""kangaroo-hours"" required to cross the highway is 3 kangaroos * 18 hours = 54 kangaroo-hours.

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, which means each turtle takes twice as long to travel the same distance as a kangaroo. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, then 3 turtles, each traveling at half the speed, would take 18 hours * 3 = 54 turtle-hours to cross the highway.

Since we are asked how many hours it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway, we need to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to equal the 54 turtle-hours. This can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Time for 4 turtles} = \frac{54 \text{ turtle-hours}}{4 \text{ turtles}} = 13.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway is 13.5 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kora makes 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, to find the total number of clay dishes they all make together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

So, the final numerical answer is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The remaining amount she needs to buy the laptop is $350, and she has $230, so the amount in her purse must be $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from the apples he slices.

From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples is:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of glue left in each stick and then sum these lengths.

1. For the first glue stick, which has 1/6 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has 2/3 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has 1/2 left:
   \[
   \text{Length of glue left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}

"Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as \( S \) and the number of dishes Jack has as \( D \).

From the problem, we know that Jack has 60 dishes, so \( D = 60 \).

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2S \) socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{D}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Given \( D = 60 \), we can solve for \( S \):
\[ 60 = 2S \]
\[ S = 30 \]

So, Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes. Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of students who are good at math, we need to consider the information given:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. Since the total number of students is 20, and we know the number of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only, we can find the number of students who are good at both by subtracting the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students good at math.
- \( E \) as the number of students good at English.
- \( B \) as the number of students good at both math and English.

From the problem, we know:
- \( M = 5 \) (students good at math only) + \( B \) (students good at both math and English).
- \( E = 8 \) (students good at English only) + \( B \) (students good at both math and English).
- The total number of students is 20.

The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of those good at math only, those good at English only, and those good at both:
\[ M + E - B = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ (5 + B) + (8 + B) - B = 20 \]
\[ 5 + 8 + B = 20 \]
\[ 13 + B = 20 \]
\[ B = 7 \]

So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is 7. Now, we can find the total number of students good at math:
\[ M = 5 + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time for one group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Now, we calculate the total time for the concert:
- Total concert time: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Subtract the intermission time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we determine how many groups can fit into the remaining time:
- Each group takes 10 minutes
- Number of groups = Total remaining time / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The original investment is $300. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is:
\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $300, the rate is 225 per year, and the time is 3 years. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 \]

First, calculate \(300 \times 225\):
\[ 300 \times 225 = 67500 \]

Then, multiply the result by 3:
\[ 67500 \times 3 = 202500 \]

So, the total interest earned over 3 years is $202,500. Adding this to the original investment gives:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 202500 = 202800 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{202800} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons, and then find the difference between these two quantities.

First, let's find the number of white shirts with no collars. We know that half of the 40 white shirts have collars, so the other half do not. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons, so the remaining floral shirts do not have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. We have already calculated that there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons. The difference between these two quantities is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer needs to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings if each tray is sold for $2.5. Since there are 30 trays and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of goats left in Farm X after selling 10 goats.
2. Calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y after selling twice as many goats as were sold from Farm X.
3. Add the remaining goats from both farms to get the total.

Let's start with Farm X:
- Initially, there are 55 goats.
- 10 goats are sold.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).

Next, let's consider Farm Y:
- Initially, there are 45 goats.
- Twice as many goats as were sold from Farm X are sold from Farm Y, which means \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats are sold.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Now, we add the remaining goats from both farms:
- Goats left in Farm X: 45
- Goats left in Farm Y: 25
- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\).

So, the final numerical answer is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we first need to determine the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs bought in a year:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets of green and red food, taking into account the discount for the red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the 3 baskets of green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the 3 baskets of red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount per basket of red food, each basket of red food costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of the green and red food baskets together:
- The total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[ \boxed{123} \]"
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned: one-half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms.
2. Calculate the total time required to clean these rooms: 45 rooms * 20 minutes per room = 900 minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours: 900 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 15 hours.

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"To find the total number of homes built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.

In the second year, they build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, the number of homes built in the second year is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

In the third year, they double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total number of homes built in the first two years is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]
So, the number of homes built in the third year is:
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \]

Now, we sum the number of homes built over the three years:
\[ 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

Thus, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Let's denote my age as \( x \). Then, my brother's age is \( x + 3 \) and my sister's age is \( x - 2 \). My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, which is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \).

The sum of our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks are required to get at least 54 glue sticks. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks. To ensure he has enough, we calculate the total number of glue sticks in 7 packs:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Since 56 is more than the 54 glue sticks needed, Mr. Jackson will have 2 extra glue sticks. Therefore, the number of packs he needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water passing through the river over the three days.

On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles. Therefore, on the second day, the amount of water is:
\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons from the amount on the second day. Thus, on the third day, the amount of water is:
\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days is the sum of the amounts for each day:
\[ 4000 + 8000 + 14000 = 26000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ 26000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected people each day, starting with the initial number of infected people and considering the rate of infection.

Initially, there are 10 infected people. Each infected person infects 6 others every day.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Total new infections = 10 * 6 = 60.
- Total infected people = Initial infected people + New infections = 10 + 60 = 70.

**Day 2:**
- Now there are 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Total new infections = 70 * 6 = 420.
- Total infected people = Infected people from Day 1 + New infections = 70 + 420 = 490.

**Day 3:**
- Now there are 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Total new infections = 490 * 6 = 2940.
- Total infected people = Infected people from Day 2 + New infections = 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is 3430."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Rafaela and Julieta received as tips.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Rafaela received as tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply the number of customers by the amount each customer gave:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received as tips. According to the problem, Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. We subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips to find out how much Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Thus, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Finally, to find the total amount of money both Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add their individual tips:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. 

Subtracting the oranges given away from the initial amount, Jennifer remained with 12 - 9 = 3 oranges. 

The final numerical answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of badges each person earns in a year and then find the difference between the number of badges Wendy earns and the number Amber earns.

First, let's establish the number of badges Claire earns in a year. Since Claire earns 1 badge every month, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Amber to earn a badge. According to the problem, it takes Amber twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire takes 1 month to earn a badge, Amber takes:
\[ 2 \text{ months} \]
to earn a badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we know that Wendy earns three times the number of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges, so the difference is:
\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \]

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to calculate the total number of banana bread slices she baked and then find out the total revenue from selling those slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours Paige spent baking:
- From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM is 5 hours.

Next, we determine how many banana bread loaves she can bake in those 5 hours:
- Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour.
- Therefore, in 5 hours, she can bake \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) banana bread loaves.

Now, we calculate the total number of slices from these 10 loaves:
- Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, 10 loaves yield \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \) slices.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 80 slices:
- Each slice is sold for 50 cents.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \( 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Let's denote the number of silver coins Gretchen has as \( S \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so the number of gold coins can be expressed as \( S + 30 \).

We are given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ S + 30 = 70 \]

To find the number of silver coins, we solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by the students from the total number of burritos ordered.
3. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the remaining burritos.

First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, subtract the number of burritos given to the students from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 500 \text{ burritos} = 100 \text{ burritos} \]

Then, subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the remaining burritos:
\[ 100 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find the number of yellow cars, we first need to determine the number of green and blue cars.

Given:
- The number of red cars is 12.
- The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
- The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
- The total number of cars is 75.

First, calculate the number of green cars:
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of blue cars:
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

Finally, subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

The number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \), the number of books Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = A + 25 \)
2. \( A = F - 12 \)
3. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from the first two equations into the third equation. First, we express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \), we get \( A + 12 = F \).
- From \( S = A + 25 \), we substitute \( A = F - 12 \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now we substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books. Let's verify this:
- If Fawn has 28 books, then Anne has \( 28 - 12 = 16 \) books.
- Sofie has \( 16 + 25 = 41 \) books.
- The total number of books is \( 41 + 16 + 28 = 85 \), which matches the given total.

Thus, the number of books Fawn has is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of small jello cups Greg wants to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required. Since one box makes 10 small jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$15.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller received $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount received:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine how much Madeline and Keenan each pay per month, and then calculate Keenan's weekly expenditure.

Given that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month, and Madeline pays 60% of the cost, we can calculate Madeline's monthly expenditure as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly expenditure} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Since the total monthly expenditure is $400, Keenan's monthly expenditure is:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly expenditure} = 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Now, to find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly expenditure by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly expenditure} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after the first day, he has \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) pieces left.

2. **Second Day**: Tobias ate 10 pieces.
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left}
   \]

3. **Third Day**: Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after the third day, he has \( 26 - 14 = 12 \) pieces left.

4. **Total Pieces Eaten**: The total number of pieces Tobias has eaten is the sum of the pieces he ate on the first, second, and third days.
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is 48."
"To solve this, we first need to find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Given that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, the cost of one bottle of soda is:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Given that four bottles of water cost $8, the cost of one bottle of water is:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, to find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Paul has left, we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him the marbles:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is 60."
"To determine the total score Amy achieves on the history test, we need to calculate the number of correct answers for each type of question and then multiply by their respective point values.

First, let's calculate the number of correct multiple-choice answers:
- There are 10 multiple-choice questions.
- Amy correctly answers 80% of them.
- Number of correct multiple-choice answers = \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of correct true/false answers:
- There are 20 true/false questions.
- Amy correctly answers 90% of them.
- Number of correct true/false answers = \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \).

Then, let's calculate the number of correct long-answer answers:
- There are 5 long-answer questions.
- Amy correctly answers 60% of them.
- Number of correct long-answer answers = \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \).

Now, we calculate the total score by multiplying the number of correct answers by their respective point values:
- Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so the total score from multiple-choice questions is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \).
- Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so the total score from true/false questions is \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \).
- Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so the total score from long-answer questions is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Finally, we sum up the scores from all question types:
- Total score = \( 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \).

Thus, Amy's total score on the history test is \(\boxed{41}\)."
"To determine the cost at which Isaias bought the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

First, we calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens must be the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses Micah sold.

Given:
- Total glasses sold: 32
- Julie sold: 14 glasses
- Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as \( M \). Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold \( M \) glasses.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell can be expressed as:
\[ 14 + M + M = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2M = 32 \]

To find \( M \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2M = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2M = 18 \]
\[ M = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah has. The rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Sarah plans to use the profit from selling the rope to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we need to know how much money she will have after selling the original rope. Since she sells the rope for $2 per meter, the total revenue from selling the rope is $40. Therefore, she will have $40 to spend on the new rope.

Now, we need to determine how many meters of the new rope she can buy with $40. The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter, so the number of meters she can buy is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{400}{15} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[ 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the new rope, the amount of money she will have left over is:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, her current age is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:** Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total. Therefore, the total cost for bacon is:
   \[
   5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken:** Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10, a pack of chicken costs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries:** Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs. Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples:** Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
50 \text{ (bacon)} + 120 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 196 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
65 - 196 = -131
\]

Since the result is negative, it means Kelly does not have enough money in her budget to cover the cost of all the items. She is short by:
\[
131 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-131}
\]"
"Let's denote the usual concert length as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Additionally, at the end of the final concert, she performs a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the length of the concert and the encore, which is given as 65 minutes. We can write this as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we sum the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones were successfully paired and then calculate the number of pairs.

First, we calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones won't be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones that fit. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that were arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
- There are 2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead, which means there are \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds flying overhead.
- There are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, which means there are \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds feeding.

Now, we can add up all the birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \( 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \).

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, leaving her with 55 - 5 = 50 cookies. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into five jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is 50 / 5 = 10. 

The final numerical answer is 10."
"To find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the African daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\) petals.

So, the final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is 25%."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we first need to determine the speed of the thingamabob. We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, we know that the whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters per second} = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"Let's break down the costs:

- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
- Let the cost of one carrot be \( C \).

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The total cost for her daily diet is given as $11. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. His new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

Next, we calculate the number of hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week. So, $12 per hour * 40 hours = $480.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week."
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Therefore, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3x \) and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5x \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:
- Earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6x \) (since Joe paid her $6 per mowing)
- Earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \)
- Earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \( 5x \times 6 = 30x \)

The total earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 54x + \text{earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

To find the earnings from lemonade, we need to determine \( x \). However, since the problem does not provide the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we can infer that the earnings from lemonade are the remaining amount after accounting for the mowing earnings. If we assume \( x = 1 \) (the simplest case), then:
\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month. He rents it 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours rented in a month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting his car in a month. He gets $25 per hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to find out the profit John makes. His car payment is $500 per month. Therefore, his profit is the total earnings minus the car payment:

\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$250 \]"
"Martha originally had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally did, he had 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. Therefore, Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph. 

The final numerical answer is 1."
"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we first need to determine how far Anis rowed.

Dijana rowed 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how many cookies each of Susan's nephews will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies after her husband took some:**
   Susan initially made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies.
   \[
   100 - 4 = 96
   \]
   So, there are 96 cookies left.

2. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among her 6 nephews:**
   We need to divide 96 cookies by 6.
   \[
   96 \div 6 = 16
   \]

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

"To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to calculate the total number of pages each of them read over the two days and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total pages read by Denise:
- Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
- Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
- Therefore, the total pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Next, let's calculate the total pages read by Daniel:
- Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
- Today, Daniel read 0 pages.
- Therefore, the total pages Daniel read is \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

Now, we find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:
- Denise read 28 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages.
- The difference is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

Thus, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much soup is available and how much is consumed by the family.

First, let's establish the total amount of soup available. Calvin's pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, he will eat one bowl of soup. His wife is also an adult, so she will eat one bowl of soup. Their two children will each eat one bowl of soup.

The total number of bowls of soup needed is:
- 1 bowl for Calvin
- 1 bowl for his wife
- 2 bowls for their two children

So, the total number of bowls of soup needed is:
\[ 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \]

Since the pot can fill four adult's bowls, it can also fill eight child's bowls. Therefore, the pot can provide enough soup for 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since the family needs 4 bowls of soup, the pot will provide exactly enough soup for the family's consumption.

After the family has eaten, there will be no leftover soup. Therefore, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \times \$0.50 = \$0.50 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount William spent:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 = \$8.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the material required for each type of mask.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material required for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Adding the material required for both types of masks:
- Total material required = material for small masks + material for large masks = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

Thus, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to determine the total number of tickets Fast and the Furious movies Deepa has seen. Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, the total number of tickets she has seen is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa has spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on various activities and then subtract this from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, which means he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we sum up the time he spends on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

A day has 24 hours, so the free time Harold has left is:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this, we first need to determine how many blue and red shoe boxes Tim uses.

Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3 of them, so he has:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes left} \]

He also starts with 9 red shoe boxes and uses 1/3 of them, so he uses:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]
This leaves him with:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left} \]

Therefore, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 \text{ blue} + 6 \text{ red} = 10 \text{ shoe boxes} \]

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the ages of Duncan and Adam in the past.

Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

Let Adam's current age be \( A \). Four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, eight years ago Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. In 8 years, Adam will be:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms is:
\[ 700 \]"

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, so the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2R \). Given that \( R = 20 \), the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown at all the balloons is 58. Therefore, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons \( Y \) can be found by dividing the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by 3. Thus, \( Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can determine the number of tune-ups by dividing the total distance by the distance between tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

The total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is 23."
"Let's break down the expenses and the money they spent:

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost of 12 balloons is $0.25 * 12 = $3.
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $7 each, so the total cost is $7 * 2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
$11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Because they split the money equally, each of them received:
$28 / 2 = $14.

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of Larry's pets, we will calculate the number of each type of pet step by step.

1. **Number of Cats:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and then find the number of cups of mint tea in each row.

First, we know that Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She divides these cups into 3 rows, with an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row. This means that each row has the same number of chamomile tea cups and the same number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \) and the number of mint tea cups in each row as \( x \). Therefore, each row has \( 2x \) cups of tea.

Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is:
\[ 3 \times 2x = 6x \]

We also know that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means that the remaining cups after dividing into rows are:
\[ 27 - 6x = 15 \]

We can solve this equation for \( x \):
\[ 27 - 6x = 15 \]
\[ 27 - 15 = 6x \]
\[ 12 = 6x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each row has \( 2x = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) cups of chamomile tea and 4 cups of mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's break down the time it takes for the sloth to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. This trip takes 4 hours. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

If the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours and he wants to collect 24 berries, then the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Tank capacity} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed from the tank in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has left after purchasing the popcorn and candy, and then determine how many movies he can see with the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy:
- Popcorn costs $8.
- A box of candy costs $2.
- Therefore, the total cost for one popcorn and one box of candy is $8 + $2 = $10.

Colby spent $10 on popcorn and candy, so the remaining money he has is:
- $150 - $10 = $140.

Next, we need to determine how many movies he can see with the remaining $140. We know that tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10 each, and tickets for other days cost $7 each. Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, and he has 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy.

Since he has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, he can only see movies on other days with the remaining money. The cost of a movie on a Friday or Saturday is $10, and the cost of a movie on other days is $7.

Let's calculate how many movies he can see on other days with the remaining $140:
- If he sees a movie on a Friday or Saturday, it costs $10.
- If he sees a movie on other days, it costs $7.

To maximize the number of movies, he should see movies on other days. Let's see how many $7 movies he can see with $140:
- $140 / $7 = 20 movies.

Therefore, Colby can see 20 movies on other days with the remaining $140. Adding the 5 movies he has already seen on a Friday or Saturday, the total number of movies he can see is:
- 5 (already seen) + 20 (newly seen) = 25 movies.

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 of that, which is 200 calories. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:

\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3 of that, which is 150 calories. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:

\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to find the total calories from all the pastries:

\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories from the pastries Andrew baked is:

\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed over the five days:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299. To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (which is 5):
\[\frac{299}{5} = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{bus}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance traveled by the car is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{car}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of other toys Sophie already has from the total number of toys she has now.

The total number of other toys Sophie has is the sum of the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old: \( P + Q + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Q = J + 10 \).
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Q + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):

\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:

\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ J = 20 \]

Now we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):

\[ Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is \( 50 \). The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself, so initially, there were \(8 + 1 = 9\) water balloons.

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding the initial number of water balloons to the additional ones, the total number of water balloons is \(9 + 15 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale.

Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff, so the total donated boxes are:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. Therefore, the total number of boxes available is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. Thus, the number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables required:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds = 40
- Distance per seed = 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 * 10 = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds = 35
- Distance per seed = 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 * 12 = 420 feet

Now, we add the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 + 420 = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average total distance spat = 820 / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can produce in a month and then find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- There are 30 days in the month.

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets produced by each machine:
- Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43200 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 259200 \text{ dollars} \]

Revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32400 \text{ widgets} \times 6 \text{ dollars/widget} = 194400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's find the difference in revenue:
\[ 259200 \text{ dollars} - 194400 \text{ dollars} = 64800 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under two scenarios: the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we can find out how much Cameron would save by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save is 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate John's earnings for the week. He earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:

\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. We divide $100 by $25:

\[ 100 \div 25 = 4 \]

So, John can buy 4 pens. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled out and then sum these totals.

First, we calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out. According to the problem, Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we sum the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can redeem with her coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles, and the teacher has 9 coupons:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student receives 2 bottles:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ 842 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the visit fee, the labor cost, and the parts cost.

The visit fee is $40.
The labor cost is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since labor is charged for part of an hour as well, we round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is $35 * 3 = $105.
The parts cost is $60.

Adding these together, the total charge is $40 + $105 + $60 = $205.

Therefore, Patty charged $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost. A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James then decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The total amount he receives from selling these 5 CDs is $40. To find out how much money he is out, we subtract the amount he received from the amount he spent on the CDs:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money James was out is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To calculate the total earnings, I will multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, I will sum up the earnings from each type of root crop:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed at which James swims the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half his initial speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   Add the time spent swimming, resting, and swimming the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

For the New York Times:
- Commission rate: 10%
- Cost per copy: $5
- Number of copies: 6

The commission from the New York Times is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from NYT} = 6 \times 5 \times \frac{10}{100} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Commission rate: 8%
- Cost per copy: $15
- Number of copies: 10

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is calculated as:
\[ \text{Commission from WSJ} = 10 \times 15 \times \frac{8}{100} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To find out how old Leo is, we can start by determining Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

So, Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\).

We also know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. Therefore, if Marcus is 21, then Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 42."
"Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's score can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. The book is 1.5 inches thick, and each inch of thickness corresponds to 100 pages. Since each page is printed on both sides of the paper, the thickness of the book is equivalent to the number of pages per inch multiplied by the number of inches.

Let's calculate the total number of pages:

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = \text{Thickness of the book (inches)} \times \text{Pages per inch}
\]

Given that the thickness of the book is 1.5 inches and there are 100 pages per inch, we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[
\text{Total number of pages} = 1.5 \times 100 = 150
\]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of minutes Vince worked and then calculate the total number of reports he stapled.

First, let's calculate the total number of minutes Vince worked:
- Vince started at 8:00 AM and worked until 11:00 PM.
- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
- Converting hours to minutes: \( 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
- Number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
- Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she spent sleepwalking.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual at 5:55 a.m. She sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is:
\[ 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Kim was not sleeping on her bed that day is 23 minutes. To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we subtract the sleepwalking time from her total sleep time:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 457 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is:
\[ 457 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons he has left:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[ \text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (14 days) is:

\[ \text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Now, we can find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the total number of patients admitted:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her family. We know that out of the sixteen emails, seven are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these nine non-work emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to her family. So, the number of family emails is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left after accounting for the work and family emails. The number of remaining emails after sending work and family emails is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

These remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. According to the problem, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. We know that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate the number that is 20% less than the number reported by Courtney. Courtney reported that there were 48 people in attendance. If this number is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 48 = \text{Actual number} \times (1 + 0.20) \]
\[ 48 = \text{Actual number} \times 1.20 \]

To find the actual number, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Actual number} = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \). Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we first need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

1. **Holes dug on the first day:** 10 holes
2. **Holes dug on the second day:** 13 holes
3. **Holes dug on the third day:** 8 holes

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

On the third day, the pirates also filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes added by the end of the third day is:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was:
\[ 10 \]

So, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since the number of holes at the end of the third day was 29, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the number Amora and Lainey received, we can write:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ \text{Total} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, let's calculate the total:
\[ \text{Total} = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]

Let's present the final numerical answer in a separate line:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the cost of travel, we first need to calculate 50% more than the cost of supplies. The cost of supplies is $400.

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the original cost of supplies gives us the total cost of travel:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the cost of travel is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) from the first two equations into the third equation. We get:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
2. \( 2S + A = 334 \)

We can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"Let's denote the number of episodes as \( E \) and the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode. It is also stated that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode, so we can write:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} \]

Substituting the value of \( M \):

\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in each segment of the journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: Norttherly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:

\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over, we need to add up all the brownies she received and subtract the ones that were eaten.

First, let's convert all the dozen measurements to individual brownies:
- One dozen brownies = 12 brownies
- Half a dozen brownies = 6 brownies
- Four dozen brownies = 48 brownies
- One and a half dozen brownies = 18 brownies

Now, let's add up all the brownies:
- Brownies from Greta herself: 12 brownies
- Brownies sent to her from her office party: 6 brownies
- Brownies from her friends at the surprise party: 48 brownies
- Brownies eaten during the party: 18 brownies

Total brownies received:
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Total brownies eaten:
18 brownies

Now, subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies received:
66 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, the final numerical answer is 48."
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we need to calculate the ages of each family member and then sum them up.

First, we know Nani's age:
\[ \text{Nani's age} = 8 \text{ years} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Nani's brother, who is twice Nani's age:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Then, we determine the age of Nani's sister, who is 25% younger than Nani. This means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we sum the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time taken for each type of racquet and then sum them up.

For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
\[ 3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
\[ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
\[ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes per racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we sum up the times:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones John buys for him, his 2 kids, and his wife, given that each phone after the first two is half price.

1. The first phone costs $600.
2. The second phone also costs $600.
3. The third phone (for John's wife) costs half of $600, which is $300.
4. The fourth phone (for John's first child) costs half of $600, which is $300.
5. The fifth phone (for John's second child) costs half of $600, which is $300.

Now, we add up the costs:
- First phone: $600
- Second phone: $600
- Third phone: $300
- Fourth phone: $300
- Fifth phone: $300

Total cost = $600 + $600 + $300 + $300 + $300 = $2100

The final numerical answer is 2100."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players. Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 13 + 20 = 33 players.

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially had:

12 boxes

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:

- She gave 2 boxes to her mom.
- She gave 2 boxes to her sister.

So, the total number of boxes given away is:

2 + 2 = 4 boxes

Now, we find out how many boxes she kept:

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find out how many boxes that is, we calculate:

1/4 of 12 boxes = 3 boxes

This means she kept 3 boxes of oranges. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:

12 boxes - 3 boxes = 9 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

9 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 180 oranges

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, let's first determine the number of states in the USA. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States has 50 states.

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, half the number of states in the USA is 50 / 2 = 25. India has 4 more than this, which means India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in India and the USA:

Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in USA
Total number of states = 29 + 50
Total number of states = 79

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to buy the books is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed to work = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed to work = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's start by determining how many cherries Richard has. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type of baked good over the two days.

**Total Gingerbread Sold:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total Apple Pie Sold:**

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we first calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over the 8 days.

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour and is outside for 4 hours each day. Therefore, the amount of sunscreen she uses per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the cost of the red car, we calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

Price of the blue car = $100

40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car.

Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is $160."
"To solve this problem, let's denote Emil's dad's current age as \(D\) and his brother's current age as \(B\).

When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 + 5 = 29\) years old. This gives us the equation:
\[29 = \frac{D + 5}{2}\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[58 = D + 5\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[D = 53\]
So, Emil's dad is currently 53 years old.

At that same time, Emil will be 24 years old, and he will be twice as old as his brother. So his brother will be \(24 / 2 = 12\) years old. This gives us the equation:
\[12 = B + 5\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we find:
\[B = 7\]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[53 + 7 = 60\]

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister and her friend.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her:

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother. Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her friend gave her:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we add up all the beads Adrianne received:
\[ 20 \text{ (from her mother)} + 30 \text{ (from her sister)} + 40 \text{ (from her friend)} = 90 \text{ beads} \]

"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day:

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(12 \div 2 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days:

- Total crawfish = Thursday's catch + Friday's catch + Saturday's catch
- Total crawfish = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

Given that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can now calculate the number of servings:

- Number of servings = Total crawfish / Crawfish per serving
- Number of servings = 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

So, the final numerical answer is 7."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of football players} = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

This means that 6 students are football players. Therefore, the remaining number of students in the class is:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. According to the problem, 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cheerleaders or band members} = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders or band members gives us the total number of students who need to leave early:

\[ \text{Total students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie's boots are size 5 * 5 = 25.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we add their shoe sizes and divide by 2:

Average size = (Sophie's size + Charlie's size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches to make the calculations easier. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the flower bed is 111 * 12 = 1332 inches long.

Each flower plant is 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (which is 1.5 * 12 = 18 inches) between every plant. Therefore, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

To find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant:

1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants.

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, she can plant 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the new plants is 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They planted 4 sunflowers.
- Therefore, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

For the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They planted 10 carnations.
- Therefore, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the remaining soil for planting roses is:
- \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, the number of roses they can plant is:
- \(3\) roses.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ \text{Monthly savings for shoes} = 25\% \times \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since Jessica can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0 pairs of shoes per month.

To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12 (the number of months in a year).

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel and saute 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to saute 90 shrimp. Since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[ \text{Time to saute} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Emily can peel and saute simultaneously, the total time required is the longer of the two times calculated, which is 30 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 30 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

First, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low for 3 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
- In 3 hours, it will cool the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

Next, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on high for 4 hours:
- The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
- In 4 hours, it will cool the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was off for 2 hours:
- The room will warm up by 2 degrees per hour.
- In 2 hours, it will warm up the room by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, we can sum up the temperature changes:
- Cooling due to low setting: -6 degrees
- Cooling due to high setting: -12 degrees
- Warming due to no air conditioner: +4 degrees

The net change in temperature is:
\[
-6 - 12 + 4 = -14 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet for the first time as 30 years. According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the second time at age \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years.

Since the comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it for the second time. Thus, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the information given and calculate the number of checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 electric bill checks per year.
2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 gas bill checks per year.
3. **Church**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) church checks per year.
4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means he writes 4 checks per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:

\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

\[
\boxed{52}

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \), and the remaining \( \frac{1}{4}F \) flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of these is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \). So, \( F = 88 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France. Since \( \frac{1}{4}F \) flights are to France, we substitute \( F = 88 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22. \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

First, we know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Therefore, the duration of Tobias' howl is:
\[ \text{Tobias' howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, the duration of Chikote's howl is:
\[ \text{Chikote's howl duration} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. Therefore, the duration of Igneous' howl is the sum of Tobias' and Chikote's howls:
\[ \text{Igneous' howl duration} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add the durations of all three wolves' howls to find the total duration in seconds:
\[ \text{Total duration} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \text{Total duration in minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam's parents gave him. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $6 * 2 = $12. 

So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total amount he needed minus the money given by his parents, which is $30 - $18 = $12.

The final numerical answer is $12."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We know the following:

1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\). Therefore, \(H = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now we can substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20\]
\[17 + W = 20\]
\[W = 20 - 17\]
\[W = 3\]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund, and then find out the total amount collected overall.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from his online fund.

So far, the total amount collected is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to consider the contribution from Walter's friend, who will give him an additional $200. Adding this to the total collected so far:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Now, we need to calculate the lawyer's contribution. The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. To find out how much everyone else has donated, we need to determine the total amount collected from neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000. The lawyer will donate three times this amount:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $6000. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of slices and the size of each slice in relation to the others.

Let's denote the total number of slices of the watermelon as \( S \).

Given that the family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide the watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Consequently, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids is:
\[ 4x \]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

Adding the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids, we get the total size of the watermelon:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total number of slices \( S \) is 8, and each slice is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the watermelon.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets \( 2x \) slices, and each slice is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the watermelon, each adult gets:
\[ 2x \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2x}{8} = \frac{x}{4} \]

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{\frac{x}{4}}{1} \times 100\% = \frac{x}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients, and each round takes 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on inpatient rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic, we convert this to minutes:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 540 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many minutes Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time he works:

\[ 540 \text{ minutes} - 480 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the remaining minutes back into hours:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required to complete all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract the total time required from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm minus 3 hours is 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The final numerical answer is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, there are \( 8 \) chocolate bars in a box.

\[
\boxed{8}

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost per student per session, along with the number of sessions per week and the number of weeks in a month.

First, let's calculate the total cost per session:
- Fixed cost of renting the studio: $25
- Variable cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total variable cost per session: $1.50 * 10 = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 + $15 = $40

Next, we calculate the number of sessions per week:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.

Then, we calculate the total cost per week:
- Total cost per week: $40 * 3 = $120

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks:
- Total cost per month: $120 * 4 = $480

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, totaling 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, totaling 56 chocolate bars.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Total number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the total number of babies born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1490 \]"
"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet, then convert that volume to gallons, and finally calculate the cost based on the given rate.

The volume of the pool in cubic feet is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. Since 1 cubic foot is approximately 7.48 gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 7.48 \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 10472 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the cost to fill the pool at $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 10472 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 1047.20 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1047.20."
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each color and then sum them up.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks.

Next, the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks:
\[ \text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Then, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:
\[ \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we sum up the sticks of all colors:
\[ \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is:

"First, let's calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The distance he traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Matteo}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. The distance she traveled can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Shandy}} \times \text{Time}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students.
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old.
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old.
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is 1875."
"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Quinn can run 5 laps.
- The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

First, let's determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is:
\[
\text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water pumped on the second day.

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is:
\[
\text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
\]

Now, we add the total amount of water pumped over the two days:
\[
\text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity to find out how much water is remaining:
\[
\text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

First, we know that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank retains 91% of its initial charge. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \]

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge each hour for 3 hours. This means that after another 3 hours, the power bank retains 93% of its charge from the previous step. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, let's calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.658 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.658 \times 0.817 = 0.28 \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ x \times 0.535 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.535} \]
\[ x \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.4%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10000.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$10000 = 0.20 \times 10000 = \$2000 \]

Next, we need to calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, and she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total weekly earnings} = (10 + 15) \times 40 = 25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches is \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars.
- The cost of 4 pears is \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 kiwis is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 apples is \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
\[1.5 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars.

Jamaar has $10 to spend, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars.

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[3\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of pieces of sweets Anne has. She has 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \]

She gave these 13 packs equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

\[ \frac{13}{10} = 1.3 \]

Each friend received 1.3 pieces of sweets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1.3 \]"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, given an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Initial Price = $120
- Growth Rate = 5% = 0.05
- Number of Years = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded to her albums. 

First, we know that Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. This means each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Next, we are told that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies and portraits can be calculated as follows:

- Number of selfies = Number of selfies-only albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

- Number of portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
  \[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits combined is:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we first need to find out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests over the course of the day.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests checked out early, reducing the number of guests by 24.
- 15 guests checked out late, reducing the number of guests by 15.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice this number is 30. So, 30 guests checked in.
- After dinner, 7 more guests checked in.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Initial number of guests: 100
2. After 24 guests checked out: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
3. After 15 guests checked out: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. After 30 guests checked in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. After 7 more guests checked in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."

"Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so we have:

\[ S = 2L \]

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, and the price of a large stuffed animal is three times that, which is $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total earnings as:

\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the earnings equation, we get:

\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \), we substitute \( L = 6 \) into this equation:

\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches consumed per day by the man, his wife, and their son.

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches consumed per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of sandwiches consumed in one week is:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate Suzanne's total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the money she gave to her two sisters. She gave each sister $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe.
2. Calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
3. Calculate the total ore mining capacity over a month.

First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. According to the problem, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Since a dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day, a dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 0.5 \times 12 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total ore mining capacity for 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes. If one dwarf can mine 18 pounds of ore per day, then 40 dwarves can mine:
\[ 40 \times 18 \text{ pounds/day} = 720 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Finally, we calculate the total ore mining capacity over a month with 30 days:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month is:
\[ \boxed{21600} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after Tom sells his old one. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000. Therefore, the net cost of the new bedroom set is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Thus, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Initially, there were 25 red balloons. A gust of wind caused 40% of them to burst:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst} \]

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released. Initially, there were 12 yellow balloons. Sally accidentally released half of them:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added} \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the various scenarios that prevent him from having to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework: 100% or 1.00
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 1.00 = 0.50\) or 50%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.50 \times 0.40 = 0.20\) or 20%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.60 \times 0.20 = 0.12\) or 12%

Now, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.12 = 0.82 \]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.82 = 0.18 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.18 \times 100 = 18\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 18%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of tickets that need to be distributed. This is the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center minus the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000 seats
Seats reserved for graduates = 950 seats
Seats reserved for faculty = 300 seats

So, the number of tickets to be distributed is:
\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

Now, these 4750 tickets are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, each graduate would receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first establish the number of medium-sized and small beans he can eat based on the information given.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans he can eat, we need to determine how many sets of 3 small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans.
   - Since 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, 150 medium-sized beans are equivalent to:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Melissa earns from jury duty.
3. Calculate the total amount of money Melissa spends on parking.
4. Determine the net amount of money Melissa earns after expenses.
5. Calculate the hourly rate of her net earnings.

Let's start with step 1:

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total number of hours she spends on jury duty is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, for step 2:

Melissa is paid $15 per day for 3 days, so the total amount of money she earns is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

For step 3:

Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so the total amount of money she spends on parking is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

For step 4:

The net amount of money Melissa earns after expenses is:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, for step 5:

To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we divide the net amount of money by the total number of hours:

"To determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she buys and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
- The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the cost of the mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

Finally, let's determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the amount of money she will have left is \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jim borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim borrowed:
- Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total loan amount = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

Next, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college:
- Before college, Jim had a $25,000 a year job.
- If he had not gone to college, he would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
- Total income if he had not gone to college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned while in college:
- While in college, Jim's income is tripled, so he earns $75,000 per year.
- Total income while in college = $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college minus the total income he would have earned while in college:
- Income lost = $300,000 (if he had not gone to college) - $100,000 (while in college) = $200,000.

Finally, we need to determine how long it would take for Jim to earn back the $200,000 he lost by not working while in college:
- Jim earns $75,000 per year while in college.
- Time to earn back the lost income = $200,000 / $75,000 = 2.67 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 2.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Each piece of fabric is an 8 feet by 10 feet rectangle. To find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply its length by its width:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

First, we know the number of letters delivered on Monday:
\[ \text{Monday} = 425 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. According to the problem, Tuesday's delivery is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Now, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that Wednesday's delivery is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery:
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Wednesday} = 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Finally, we sum the number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 736 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{736} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Winning in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (since he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Therefore, the average amount Johnny's dad lost per race is approximately $7.17."
"To find the total population in South America, we can multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country and then by the number of people living in each city.

Given:
- Number of countries in South America = 26
- Number of cities in each country = 5
- Number of people living in each city = 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities per country * Number of people per city

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000

Let's calculate this:

Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000 = 130,000

Therefore, the total population in South America is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. He grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total hours of work each painter put in over the given period.

First, we need to determine the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know that each day they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Therefore, the total number of days worked by each painter is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \]

To convert this into hours, we know that 1 day is 24 hours. Thus, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
\[ \frac{63}{8} \times 24 = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{63 \times 3}{1} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 189 \]"
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value each year.

Let's denote the initial price of the car in 2007 as \( P_0 = \$20000 \).

The price of the car in 2008, \( P_1 \), would be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times 0.79 \]

The price of the car in 2009, \( P_2 \), would be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^2 \]

The price of the car in 2010, \( P_3 \), would be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times 0.79 = P_0 \times 0.79^3 \]

Now, substituting the initial price \( P_0 = \$20000 \) into the equation for \( P_3 \):
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

Calculating \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.627441 \]

Therefore:
\[ P_3 = 20000 \times 0.627441 = 12548.82 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \$12548.82 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we have:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego, California and New York City, New York.

The total distance is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has driven 325 kilometers.

So, the remaining distance is calculated as follows:

\[ 1955 - 325 = 1630 \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days, and then convert that into gallons.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Therefore, in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert the total cups into gallons by dividing the total cups by the number of cups in a gallon:
\[ 240 \, \text{cups} \div 16 \, \text{cups/gallon} = 15 \, \text{gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we will follow the sequence of events and calculate the number of people on the train at each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 original price, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to determine how many tiles are required. Since each tile is 1ft by 1ft, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet. Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, we need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year, we first need to calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.

The normal monthly cost is $120. The increased cost is 60% more than the normal cost. To find 60% of $120, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays in a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance."
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we first need to calculate the number of loads he does in a week.

A twin set of sheets consists of 2 twin beds, so 4 twin beds would be 2 twin sets. A king set of sheets consists of 1 king bed. Therefore, Greg needs to do the following laundry loads per week:
- 2 loads for the twin sets (4 twin beds)
- 1 load for the king set

So, in a week, Greg does a total of 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:
3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year

The final numerical answer is 156."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate the number of movies they watch in one weekend.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies} \]

So, in one weekend, they watch:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will have 4 weekends. Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ movies} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to calculate the number of stickers he has each year and sum them up.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, the number of stickers he had at the end of last year would be:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
So, the number of stickers he has at the end of this year would be:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection now is:
\[ 250 \]"
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume per day.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day by all the cats is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams per cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and we know Becky ate 10 slices. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 31 \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 58 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300/hour for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill for 30 pills. So, the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add these amounts together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5 day work week, we first need to calculate how many emails he responds to in a single day.

James gets 80 emails a day. 20% of these emails do not require any response. Therefore, 80% of the emails require a response.

To find the number of emails that require a response, we calculate 80% of 80:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day.

In a 5 day work week, the total number of emails he responds to is:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is 320."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

Let's perform the addition step by step:

First, add 32 and 64:
\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 to 96:
\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 192 and 30:
\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:
\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score he received across all 4 tests. 

John's scores are as follows:
- First 3 tests: 100 each, so 3 * 100 = 300
- 4th test: 80

Total score = 300 + 80 = 380

To find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4.

Average score = Total score / Number of tests = 380 / 4 = 95

So, the final numerical answer is 95."
"First, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the glee club has:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team has:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

"First, let's determine the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones, and he wants to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means she ordered:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three meatball sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after ordering the additional three is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers. 

First, we determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had issues, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that the remaining trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser:
\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 trucks is:
\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur for purchasing 6 pounds of butter, we need to consider the promotion and the cost per pound of butter.

First, let's calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs:
- Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
- He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
- Therefore, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Next, we consider the promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""
- This means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.
- To find out how many pounds Dennis needs to buy to get 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we can use the following logic:
  - For every 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound.
  - Therefore, for 6 pounds, he needs to buy 4 pounds to get 6 pounds of butter with the promotion.

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Dennis needs to buy 4 pounds of butter.
- The total cost is \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$16.00 \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla invited her 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

Next, we need to determine the number of guests who will actually attend the party. Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests attending is:

- Total guests invited - Guests who could not come = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest beyond 20. The number of additional guests is:

- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

The cost for the additional guests is:

- Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

- Base rental fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final numerical answer is $251."
"Let's denote the amount of money Maggie had as \( M \) and the amount of money Riza had as \( R \). According to the problem, both Maggie and Riza had $60 initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{4}M \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = \frac{3}{4}M \]

Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent \( \frac{1}{3}R \). The amount of money she has left is:
\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = \frac{2}{3}R \]

Since both Maggie and Riza initially had $60, we can substitute \( M = 60 \) and \( R = 60 \) into the expressions for the money they have left:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

The total amount of money they have left is the sum of the money left with Maggie and Riza:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 85 \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both monkeys in a day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. He then finished another 500-piece puzzle, placing another 500 pieces. Therefore, Teddy placed a total of 250 + 500 = 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought. She bought 15 roses, and since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the roses in terms of a dozen. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we need to find out how many dozens of roses Jenny bought. Since 15 roses is more than a dozen but less than two dozens, we can calculate the cost as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ roses} = 1 \text{ dozen} \]
\[ 1 \text{ rose} = \frac{15}{14} \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 15 \text{ roses} = 15 \times \frac{15}{14} = \frac{225}{14} \approx 16.07 \text{ dollars} \]

However, since the florist charges by the dozen, we can consider the cost as 1 dozen and the remaining 1 rose, which is approximately $1.43. But for simplicity and to match the given pricing, we'll consider the cost as $15 for 12 roses and the remaining 3 roses at $2 each, which totals to $15 + $6 = $21. But since the problem states $15 for a dozen, we'll stick to $15 for 12 roses and the remaining 3 roses at $2 each, which totals to $15 + $6 = $21, but the florist charges $15 for a dozen, so we'll consider the cost as $15 for 12 roses and the remaining 3 roses at $2 each, which totals to $15 + $6 = $21, but the problem states $15 for a dozen, so we'll consider the cost as $15 for 12 roses and the remaining 3 roses at $2 each, which totals to $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is $25. After paying $15 for the roses, she has:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only gives change in quarters, we need to convert $10 into quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she gets is:

\[ \frac{10}{0.25} = 40 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find out when Paul's train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departure time: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves, so at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it stays in the station for 0 minutes.
   - Departure time: 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for the same amount of time as the first train, so 20 minutes.
   - Departure time: 145 + 20 = 165 minutes.

Paul's train is the fourth train, which arrives at 145 minutes. Since Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes, he will wait for 145 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
145"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved.

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Since she has already saved 120 toothpicks, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

If Melanie continues saving toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Determine the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.
3. Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received.**

The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for, expressed as a percentage of the original price.
\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Discount Percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, given that each spring creates one jellyfish per second.

First, let's calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour. Therefore, one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour.

Next, we calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours. Since one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour, it will create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs will create in 4 hours. Since each spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, 5 springs will create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. Binkie's score is 90. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times \text{Binkie's score} + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, we perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Frankie's score} = 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 195 \]"
"Let's break down the journey:

1. James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
2. He then has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. The total distance he walks is 2 miles + 2 miles = 4 miles.
4. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took him to reach the store, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 1 hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, to find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \). According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:

\[ H = S + 60 \]

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we also have:

\[ S + H = 100 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine its growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so its growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply its growth rate by the number of years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is 26 inches."
"To determine Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

First, let's find the number of each type of bike sold:
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes sold - BMX bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 65

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = Half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from MTB bikes = 65 * $500 = $32,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:
- Total earnings = $32,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $111,250

Thus, Marcel earned $111,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales of hay that are being added to and removed from the field each hour, and then multiply that by the number of hours they work.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Therefore, the net number of bales of hay added to the field each hour is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ bales per hour} \]

If they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales of hay added to the field is:

\[ 2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is:

\[ 12 \text{ bales} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this, let's break down the time John spends on classes and learning each week.

First, let's calculate the number of periods John has to attend each day. Normally, there are 6 periods, but he has to take 2 extra classes, so he has 8 periods each day.

Each period is 40 minutes long, so each day he spends:
\[ 8 \text{ periods/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/period} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

He goes to class for 5 days a week, so in a week, he spends:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on extra learning time. So, the total minutes he spends on extra learning time in a week is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes/week} = 100 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we add the minutes spent in classes and the extra learning time to find the total minutes spent learning in a week:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 100 \text{ minutes/week} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes/week}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{85}{3} \text{ hours/week} \]"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the height from which the ball is dropped is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, on the first bounce, the ball reaches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball again bounces to 2/3 of its height from the first bounce, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's convert all heights to inches for easier calculation. 

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
\[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
\[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
\[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall. 

\[
\boxed{72}

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags sold} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples sold}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags sold} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag. 

\[
\boxed{1000}

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

The T-Rex ate half of the meat, so the remaining meat was \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so the remaining meat after the velociraptors was \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \).

The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means:

\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ x = 270 \times 4 = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms."
"To calculate the cost of painting the room, we first need to determine the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Given that a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 144 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda can.

Initially, Ellen has a case of 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them, leaving 9 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Her brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. 

So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours and then sum these distances to find the total distance between the two trains.

The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 270 \]"
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total number of days Billy works and then determine how many people he helps.

Billy works 3 hours a day and can help 2 people per hour. Therefore, he can help \(3 \times 2 = 6\) people per day.

The period from March 1st to April 19th includes all of March and the first 19 days of April. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. The number of days he works is \(50 \times 0.8 = 40\) days.

Since he helps 6 people per day, the total number of people he helps is \(40 \times 6 = 240\).

The final numerical answer is 240."
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars, and then sum these two numbers.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the buses is \(12 \times 35\).

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.
- Therefore, the total number of people in the cars is \(20 \times 3\).

Finally, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to get the total number of people inside the church.

Let's do the calculations:

\[
12 \times 35 = 420

"To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial charge of $85.00.
2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount. The original price of the frying pan is $20.00, so the discount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00. Therefore, the frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount. The original price of the set of towels is $30.00, so the discount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00. Therefore, the set of towels costs $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. After returning the $15.00 item: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can say that the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Among the large jellyfish, a third change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

According to the problem, when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ T = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement plan, given her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and the percentage of her salary she plans to live on in retirement.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 annual salary:
\[ \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much she will need to save for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary in retirement, which is:
\[ \text{Annual living expenses in retirement} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \]

Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to find out how much she needs to save in total to cover her living expenses for 20 years:
\[ \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to save $800,000. Since she saves $20,000 each year, the number of years required is:
\[ \text{Years needed to save} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) equals 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 360 \]"

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. She intends to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total number of miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of days in June:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

Now, we determine the total number of miles she plans to hike in June:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since she needs to hike 9,300 miles and plans to hike 7,500 miles, the number of additional miles she needs to hike per day is:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

For the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls.
- Each red ball costs $9.
- Total revenue from red balls = 3 * $9 = $27.

For the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls.
- Each blue ball costs $5.
- Total revenue from blue balls = 11 * $5 = $55.

For the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls.
- Each green ball costs $3.
- Total revenue from green balls = 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
- Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total amount of apples bought by Pierre, Paul, and Jacques is 12 kg.
2. Peter wants a quarter of that, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) kg.
3. Paul wants a third of that, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) kg.
4. The total amount of apples taken by Peter and Paul is \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) kg.
5. The amount of apples left for James is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \) kg.

So, the final numerical answer is 5 kg."
"The temperature dropped by 8 degrees Celsius, so it became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. Then it increased by 3 degrees Celsius, so the temperature in the morning was -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius. 

The final temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of money Raymond had, which is $21.
2. Add the amount he saved from his allowance, which is $11.
3. Subtract the amount he spent on the comic book, which is $5.
4. Subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle, which is $19.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Initial amount: $21
2. After saving $11: $21 + $11 = $32
3. After spending $5 on a comic book: $32 - $5 = $27
4. After spending $19 on a puzzle: $27 - $19 = $8

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each book cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna has left after her purchases. She started with $16 and has $2 left, so she has spent $16 - $2 = $14.
2. Subtract the amount she has already spent from the total amount spent to find out how much she spent on the books. She has already spent $4, so the amount spent on the books is $14 - $4 = $10.
3. Since she bought 2 books and each book cost the same amount, we divide the total amount spent on the books by 2. Therefore, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.

The cost of each book is $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year's enrollment was 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. Adding this increase to last year's enrollment gives us the current enrollment:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse's light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the rate we just calculated to find the time required:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fishes after Tate buys more.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fishes, Tate has:
- 4 (initial male guppies) + 2 (additional male guppies) = 6 male guppies
- 7 (initial female guppies) + 1 (additional female guppy) = 8 female guppies
- 3 (initial male goldfishes) + 2 (additional male goldfishes) = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 (initial female goldfishes) + 3 (additional female goldfishes) = 8 female goldfishes

Now, we can calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference = 16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores:

- Amalia's chore was mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
- Megan's chore was walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's chore. Therefore, Megan's chore took her \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
- Dior's chore was doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's chore. Since Amalia's chore took 4 hours, Dior's chore took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's denote the time Dior took as \(D\). According to the problem, \(D > 8\) hours.

Now, we can calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 6 + D
\]

Since \(D > 8\), the minimum value for \(D\) is 9 hours. Therefore, the minimum total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

\[
4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"To determine the total miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way driving time in hours:**
   John drives for 2 hours each way.

2. **Calculate the total driving time for a round trip:**
   Since the round trip involves driving to his parents and back, the total driving time is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (to)} + 2 \text{ hours (back)} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the speed of the car:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

4. **Calculate the total distance driven in a round trip:**
   Distance is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 280 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, John drives a total of 280 miles each month when visiting his parents."
"If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk a total of \(10 \times 7 = 70\) miles.

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, Brian will walk half the distance that Sofie walks in 7 days. Thus, Brian will walk \(70 \div 2 = 35\) miles in 7 days.

The final numerical answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production rate of the first 4 workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Adding these together, the total production rate of the first 4 workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in 10 hours is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. This means that the number of toys produced by the first 4 workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys short of the order.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce enough toys to make up the difference. The fifth worker must produce \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the information given.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog would weigh:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight of both sets of dogs:
\[ 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 105 \]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had initially as \( S \).

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.

Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.

Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This implies that the remaining stickers Kris received were 7, which means \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \).

We can solve this equation to find \( S \):

\[
\frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \\
\frac{S}{4} = 16 \\
S = 64
\]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the M&Ms John has. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&Ms are in these 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms, 30 ounces will contain:

\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we first need to determine the speed of the second fastest car, and then use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

Given:
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
- The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.

First, calculate the speed of the second fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the average car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, calculate the speed of the fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of the second fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve this, let's first establish the ages of Liam and Vince two years ago.

Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

According to the problem, two years ago Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \) (since they painted the same number). Therefore, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is \( 2A \).

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). According to the problem, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \).

We are given that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can substitute this value back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we calculate:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. 

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box. Since each box contains 8 crayons, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the weight of each box will be:

\[ \text{Weight of each box} = 8 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 8 \text{ ounces} \]

Each box also weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of each box (which contains 8 crayons and weighs 8 ounces) is:

\[ \text{Total weight of each box} = 8 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 8 \text{ ounces (box)} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 25 boxes, the total weight of all the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of all boxes} = 25 \times 16 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equals 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the 80-foot tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, the length of the logs is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate how many 4-foot logs can be cut from 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many planks John can get from these 16 logs. Since he cuts 5 planks from each log:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling these planks at $1.2 each:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Valerie's brother earns.
2. Calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother.
3. Find out how much their mother earns.
4. Sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother.

First, we know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, and then sum these times to find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk.

First, let's denote the speed of Grandma on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the speed on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent on the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds, we can add up the birds in each tree:

- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Adding these together: \(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Bob currently has. If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the number of marbles Bob currently has:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Bob currently has} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. 

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, and then he pours 1 ounce from the other mug. After these actions, the water in the water bottle is drinkable, meaning it must be at least 40 degrees.

The initial amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the temperature of this water is 33 degrees. After pouring 4 ounces, the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is 0 ounces, and the temperature of the water in the water bottle is 33 degrees.

The 1 ounce of water from the other mug is poured into the water bottle, and the temperature of this water is \( T \) degrees. After pouring 1 ounce, the temperature of the water in the water bottle becomes:

\[ \text{New temperature} = \frac{33 \times 4 + T \times 1}{4 + 1} = \frac{132 + T}{5} \]

For the water in the water bottle to be at least 40 degrees, we need:

\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5 gives:

\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives:

\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 68 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, given the initial number of animals and the daily additions.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added over three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks would be 21 days. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so over 21 days, they would bring:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of chickens added over three weeks. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so over 21 days, they would bring:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added over three weeks. Initially, there are 50 cows and 20 chickens. After three weeks, the number of cows will be:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 420 \text{ cows} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

And the number of chickens will be:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the cows and chickens:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. With a 10% discount, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per bagel is the total discounted cost divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Thus, the cost per bagel after the discount is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. According to the problem, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 1 less than 3 is 2 scoops, 1 less than 6 is 5, so it takes 5 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Since 2 scoops require 5 potatoes, 18 scoops would require:

\[ \frac{18}{2} \times 5 = 9 \times 5 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozen} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we first need to determine the number of red jellybeans. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can now calculate the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - 17 - 34 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

\[ 9 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, we need to calculate the total number of lemons he collects from all his trees over a period of 10 years.

First, we know that Tim grows 5 trees and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. Therefore, the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year is:

\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how many lemons he collects over a decade (10 years). We multiply the number of lemons collected in one year by 10:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any alight.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is given as 84, so we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales. Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per bouquet is 12. If Faraday earned $56 from the bouquets per day, we can find the number of bouquets sold per day by dividing the total earnings by the price per bouquet:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets is:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

Next, we need to find out how many sunflowers were sold from the sunflower sales. Each sunflower is sold for $2, and Faraday earned $26 from the sunflowers per day. Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflowers is:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold from the bouquets and the sunflowers sold from the individual sunflowers:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold per day} = 84 + 13 = 97
\]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:

\[
\text{Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:

\[
\boxed{291}
\]"
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue if Adam sells all 20 rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$140
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam sells (60% of his inventory):**
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \text{ rocks} \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$84
   \]

5. **Calculate the loss:**
   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = \$140 - \$84 = \$56
   \]

Therefore, Adam loses \(\boxed{56}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

Next, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

Finally, we calculate the number of days needed to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized picture scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
- Total days = 9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days.

Therefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is 22 days."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 3 * 12 = 36 eggs. If these eggs are to be divided equally among her four children, each child would receive 36 / 4 = 9 eggs.

"To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of days in May**: May has 31 days.

2. **Calculate the daily cost of food for all the fish**: Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. Jen has 3 fish, so the total daily cost of food is:
   \[
   3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of food for the month of May**: Multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May:
   \[
   \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93
   \]

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia originally had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses. 

The final numerical answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both tickets are winners. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the probabilities for each ticket:
- The probability that the first ticket is a winner is given as 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability that the second ticket is a winner is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent (the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other), we multiply the probabilities of each event occurring.

The probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos as \( C \), by Jim as \( J \), and by Carrey as \( R \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \) into this equation, we get \( 27 = C + 5 \), which simplifies to \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \) into this equation, we get \( 22 = 2R \), which simplifies to \( R = 11 \).

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided these seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can break it down by days:

- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.

So, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots.

The total number of carrots eaten on Saturday and Sunday is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots.

Adding these together, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we first need to calculate the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + (0.60 \times 5) \]

\[ \text{Duration of second song} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

\[ \text{Total time} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To determine Linus's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of each mobile device. Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices. Linus bought 2 mobile devices last Monday and 4 mobile devices last Tuesday, so he bought a total of:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ mobile devices} \]

The total revenue from selling all 6 mobile devices is:

\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the 6 mobile devices. Since each mobile device costs $20, the total cost is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how long Carl's cane is, we need to first determine Carl's height. We know Isabel's height and the relationships between the heights of Isabel, Ned, and Carl.

1. Isabel's height is 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.

Now, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(6 / 2 = 3\) feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many more bottles are needed by subtracting the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed. Each bottle can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need:

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \]

This is because 100% is equivalent to 5 bottles (since 20% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 1 bottle).

Next, we know that Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production capacity from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles Hortex would have to produce is:

\[ \boxed{7300} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's calculate the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total babies: 8
- Babies dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Babies dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to two decimal places for simplicity, we can consider it as 1 baby)
- Babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This is calculated by dividing the number of purple-wearers wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing bows, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \)."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

Given:
- Total reports received last week = 5168
- Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
- Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

We can calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total land sold in the first transaction:**
   Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it.
   \[
   \text{Land sold in the first transaction} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price for this land was $50.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from the first transaction} = 40 \times 50 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining land after the first transaction:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining land} = 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the land sold in the second transaction:**
   Abraham then sold 1/4 of the remaining land.
   \[
   \text{Land sold in the second transaction} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price for this land was $30.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from the second transaction} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining land after the second transaction:**

"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate how many times Tyrion changes his face mask in one day. Since he changes his mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ masks/time} \times 3 \text{ times/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days. Since he uses 6 masks in one day, in 2 days he will use:
\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 3 dozen eggs would be:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we'll calculate the number of eggs each person found:

- Lamar found 5 eggs.
- Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

- Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

- Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we'll sum the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week and then determine his weekly earnings.

First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the first two complexes:
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- Therefore, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
  \[
  200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
  \]

Next, we need to find the number of apartments in the third complex. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. We first calculate 60% of the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
\[
0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}
\]

Adding this to the total number of apartments in the first two complexes gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:
\[
400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex:
- For the first two complexes, he collects garbage 3 times a week each:
  \[
  3 \times 200 = 600 \text{ apartments per week}
  \]
- For the third complex, he collects garbage 3 times a week:
  \[
  3 \times 640 = 1920 \text{ apartments per week}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of apartments he collects garbage from in a week:
\[
600 + 1920 = 2520 \text{ apartments per week}
\]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
\[
2520 \times 0.40 = 1008 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1008}

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(200\) fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.
   - Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

\[

"Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, and the red rope as \( R \) centimeters. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Next, we substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:

\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:

\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the length of the red rope:

\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Rissa received as \( R \). According to the problem, Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie, so we can write:

\[ R = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Ronnie received $5, so the total amount of money Rissa had initially was $15. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their sister, Rissa is left with \( 4/5 \) of her original amount. Therefore, we can write:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4 \times 15}{5} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

From this, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, each of them gave $3 to their sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Also, half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) (since they are equal):
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2."
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms and the living room, and then add the area of the rest of the house.

First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know the area of the rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

Starting with Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

For Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

For Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

For Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

For Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted from Monday to Friday:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 93 \]"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of pods in the special size box. The original box has 100 pods and costs $12. The special size box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate the number of additional pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]
So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Next, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run with $1 if each cycle uses 1 pod. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run with $1 by dividing the number of pods by the cost per pod:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ cycles per dollar} \]

Therefore, with $1, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. Since he withdrew $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we can calculate the number of bills as follows:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home, so the number of bills he has left is:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. The number of bills he uses is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Thomas then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
240
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of goals scored by each team in the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

Next, we calculate the number of goals scored by each team in the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals in the second half.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals in the second half.

Now, we sum up the goals scored by each team in the entire match:
- Team A scores \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals in total.
- Team B scores \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals in total.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
\[6 + 10 = 16\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[16\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using only 20% of the chalk each day before he has to recycle it.

First, let's calculate how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day, and he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, the amount of chalk used on Monday is:

\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

This means the amount of chalk remaining after Monday is:

\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

Now, the teacher will use only 20% of the remaining chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day after Monday will be:

\[ 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

We need to find out how many days the teacher can continue using this amount of chalk before he has to recycle it. This is calculated by dividing the remaining chalk by the amount used each day:

\[ \frac{2.75}{0.55} = 5 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 5 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls who are on varsity.

Given:
- Total number of boys = 12
- Total number of girls = 12
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

First, calculate the number of girls on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, calculate the number of boys on varsity:
\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, calculate the total number of students on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (boys)} = 7 \]

Finally, calculate the number of students not on varsity:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike bought 5 face masks.
2. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we can calculate it as follows:

- Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- Johnny bought 2 more than this amount, so he bought \(15 + 2 = 17\) face masks.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 17."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James has 30 teeth in total. The dentist drills 4 teeth. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

So, the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
50

"To determine the refund amount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of the milk is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much of this milk had passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk. So, the amount of milk that was returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Thus, the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

Let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Now substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old. Let's verify this by calculating Wendy's age and checking the conditions of the problem.

If Colin is 20 years old, then:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

In 25 years, Colin will be 45 years old, and Wendy will be 160 years old. Checking the second condition:
\[ C + 25 = 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}W = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct. Colin is currently 20 years old."
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob is distributing the money between 3 schools, we can find out how many books each school gets by dividing the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ 1800 \]

Final numerical answer:

\[ 1800 \]"

2. One of them landed on Newton's head, leaving one apple on the ground.
3. Newton picked up the one apple on the ground and put one apple in his pocket, leaving one apple on the ground.
4. He threw the remaining apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
5. Now there are 5 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
7. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree, making the total 11 apples on the ground.
8. Newton picked up all 11 apples and went home to make a pie.

So, Newton brought home 11 apples. 

The final numerical answer is 11."
"First, we need to determine how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends consume.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 6 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from cheese pizza = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each of her 6 friends eats 4 slices.
- Total slices eaten by friends from pepperoni pizza = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Next, we calculate the number of pizza pies needed for each type of pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
- The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizza pies needed = Total slices eaten / Slices per pie = 36 slices / 12 slices per pie = 3 pies.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizza pies needed = Total slices eaten / Slices per pie = 24 slices / 8 slices per pie = 3 pies.

Since Kate needs to buy enough pies to satisfy the consumption of both types of pizza, and both calculations result in 3 pies, she needs to buy 3 cheese pizza pies and 3 pepperoni pizza pies.

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
3 cheese pizza pies + 3 pepperoni pizza pies = 6 pizza pies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, for these three days, he ran:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, he ran:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from both sets of days gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 19 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the net number of snowballs Jay can make per hour and then determine how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. This means that in 15 minutes, 18 snowballs are added to the total (20 built - 2 melted). Therefore, in an hour (which is 4 intervals of 15 minutes), the net increase in snowballs is:

\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \text{ snowballs} \]

However, we need to find out how long it takes to reach 60 snowballs. Since Jay can add 18 snowballs every 15 minutes, we can calculate the time required to reach 60 snowballs by dividing the number of snowballs needed by the net increase per 15 minutes:

\[ \frac{60}{18} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Converting \(\frac{10}{3}\) hours into minutes:

\[ \frac{10}{3} \times 60 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Jay 200 minutes to have 60 snowballs. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"If John is 28 years old now, and when Digimon came out, he was twice as old as Jim, we can set up the following equation to find Jim's age at that time:

Let \( J_d \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out. Then John's age at that time was \( 2J_d \). Given that John is 28 now, we can say that the difference in their ages is constant over time. So, if John is 28 now, he was \( 28 - J_d \) years older than Jim when Digimon came out. This difference is equal to \( 2J_d - J_d = J_d \).

Therefore, \( 28 - J_d = J_d \), which simplifies to \( 28 = 2J_d \), and solving for \( J_d \) gives \( J_d = 14 \).

So, Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out. Since 20 years have passed since Digimon came out, Jim is now \( 14 + 20 = 34 \) years old.

The final numerical answer is 34."
"Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, which means she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices. 

Adding up all the slices they ate together: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"Let's break down the problem day by day to find out how many bandages were used and how many were left at the end of each day.

**First Day:**
- They used 38 bandages.
- They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- So, at the end of the first day, they had \(38 - 38 + 50 = 50\) bandages.

**Second Day:**
- They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
- At the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 28 = 22\) bandages.

**Third Day:**
- They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
- They used half a bulk pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
- At the end of the third day, they had \(22 - 25 + 100 = 77\) bandages.

However, the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This discrepancy suggests a need to recheck the initial conditions or the problem statement. Given the problem's conditions and the logical steps, the initial number of bandages they had on the first day is 50.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to consider her regular pay and the additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her regular pay for a single day:
\[ \text{Regular pay per day} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \times \$1.5 \text{ per hour} = \$11.25 \]

Next, we calculate her regular pay for a single week:
\[ \text{Regular pay per week} = 6 \text{ days} \times \$11.25 \text{ per day} = \$67.50 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her regular pay for the entire month is:
\[ \text{Regular pay for April} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$67.50 \text{ per week} = \$270.00 \]

Additionally, Jen receives an attendance bonus of $10 for each week she has complete attendance. Since she had complete attendance for all 4 weeks, her total attendance bonus for April is:
\[ \text{Attendance bonus for April} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$10 \text{ per week} = \$40.00 \]

Adding her regular pay and the attendance bonus together gives us her total earnings for April:
\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

Therefore, Jen will receive $310.00 in April."

"First, let's determine the amount of blood in a single shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks will have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \]

"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

First, we know that 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. 

At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. 

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:
\[ 50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (twice 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is:

"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, which means she bought 5 * 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice the amount of black pens, which means she bought 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens. Therefore, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 black pens. In total, Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 

The final numerical answer is 75."
"Let's denote the cost per bottle of scotch as \( S \) and the number of bottles of cognac as \( C \). We know that John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600, so:

\[ 10S = 600 \]
\[ S = 60 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so:

\[ C = 2 \times 10 = 20 \] (since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac)

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 1.5 \times S = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \]

Now, the total cost for the cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \]

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac gives us the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is $2400."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we determine the number of trees planted on the first day:
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the first day is:
\[20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day was 40, so \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(40 \times \frac{1}{4} = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}\]

Finally, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius:
\[60 \text{ (first day)} + 80 \text{ (second day)} = 140 \text{ trees}\]

Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and then the number of fish with blue stripes.

1. **Number of fish with red stripes:**
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Total number of fish = 66.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22\).

2. **Number of remaining fish after accounting for the red-striped fish:**
   - Total number of fish = 66.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22.
   - Remaining fish = \(66 - 22 = 44\).

3. **Number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of remaining fish = 44.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \(\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20\).

4. **Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = 20.
   - Total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes = \(22 + 20 = 42\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- Three makeup sets, each with six colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy had initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors. Therefore, Amy loses four colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each makeup set has six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[6 / 2 = 3\]

So, Amy uses up three colors. Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors she has left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's calculate the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height of the first floor. The problem states that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. Therefore, the height of the first floor is:

\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, we can find the height of the second floor by subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of shells found by each team.

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas. They found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we find out how many shells are left after team Alphas have found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"Let's denote the number of miles the last dog needs to walk as \(x\).

The total number of miles all four dogs need to walk per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs to walk. This can be expressed as:
\[1 + 4 + 3 + x\]

We know that the average number of miles per dog is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total number of miles all dogs need to walk per day is:
\[3 \times 4 = 12\]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[8 + x = 12\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[x = 12 - 8\]
\[x = 4\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day. The final numerical answer is:
\[4\]"
"First, let's calculate the loan amount John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount Used to Pay Off Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

\[ \text{Money Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught and then multiply that by the price per kilogram.

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kg
- Second tuna: 46 kg
- Third tuna: 26 kg

The total weight of the tunas is:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kg} \]

The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, the total earnings from selling all the tunas is:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 64 \]"
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them. 

The cost price of the magazines is $72. 

The selling price is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

Let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per setting and then sum these amounts.

First, we know the low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. If Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days, the amount of water removed is:
\[ 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting. Therefore, the medium setting removes:
\[ 2 \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 2 \text{ liters/day} \]
If Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days, the amount of water removed is:
\[ 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Finally, the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting. Therefore, the high setting removes:
\[ 2 \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 4 \text{ liters/day} \]
If Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days, the amount of water removed is:
\[ 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \]

Adding up the water removed from all settings, we get:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is:
\[ \boxed{29} \]"
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons they initially had and then subtract the number of balloons left.

They filled 10 packs with 30 balloons each, so the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left, so the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 - 12 = 288 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi had to combine with the first medicine for one dose. The first medicine is 14 mL, and the second medicine is 3 times that amount:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

So, for one dose, the total amount of medicine is:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find out how many mL of medicine would be in 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of Ali's class. According to the information provided, Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Next, we need to find the capacity of John's classes. The problem states that each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's class and the total capacity of John's classes:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest, and then determine how much he will pay each month and the remaining amount for the twelfth month.

First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister, including the 2% interest:
- The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300.
- The interest is 2% of $300, which is \( 0.02 \times 300 = 6 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount Stephen will owe is \( 300 + 6 = 306 \) dollars.

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will pay each month for 11 months and the remaining amount for the twelfth month. Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is:
\[ 11 \times 25 = 275 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he owes minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of diaper changes required per day for Jordan's two children. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for two children, the total number of diaper changes per day is:

\[ 5 \text{ (diaper changes per child)} \times 2 \text{ (children)} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan's wife is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

This means that the remaining half of the diaper changes are made by Jordan. Therefore, the number of diaper changes made by Jordan per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ diaper changes per day} - 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the volume of the jar and then determine the number of jelly beans that fit inside it, considering the packing efficiency. After that, we can find out how many of those jelly beans are red and compare that to the true number of red jelly beans.

First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \(V\) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many jelly beans fit into the jar, considering the packing efficiency. Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Effective volume} = \frac{540}{0.8} = 675 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Given that each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches, the number of jelly beans that can fit into the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{675}{0.15} = 4500 \]

Now, we know that 30% of these jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 0.30 \times 4500 = 1350 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. The difference between the estimated number and the true number is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 1350 - 900 = 450 \]

So, Tim was 450 jelly beans off in his guess. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **Number of passengers who entered the bus at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of passengers on the bus after the first stop**: 20 (initial) + 40 (first stop) = 60 people.
4. **Number of passengers who entered the bus at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of passengers on the bus after the second stop**: 60 (after first stop) + 30 (second stop) = 90 people.
6. **Number of passengers on the bus after the third stop**: The number of passengers doubled = 90 \(\times\) 2 = 180 people.
7. **Bus capacity**: 200 people.
8. **Remaining capacity on the bus**: 200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of passengers) = 20 people.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"To determine how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the total cost of her visits over the 8 years.

First, we calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it has increased by 150%. The increase in cost is calculated as follows:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \]
So, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of visits over the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum 3 times a year, the cost for one year is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]
Over 5 years, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit remains $5, and she continues to visit 3 times a year. The cost for these 3 years is:
\[ 5 \times 3 \times 3 = 45 \]

Adding the costs from both periods gives the total amount spent:
\[ 75 + 45 = 120 \]

Thus, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups required and then multiply by the time each group takes.

First, we find the total number of students in the school who are eligible to try the escape room. Since there are 10 students in each grade and there are three grades (grades 4, 5, and 6), the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 30 students. Since each group consists of 8 students, the number of groups required is:
\[ \left\lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 3.75 \right\rceil = 4 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

$80 + $20 = $100

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation gives:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is then:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of his secret seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of meat needed:**
   Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the amount of meat required as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of meat} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning required is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Amount of meat} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which translates to the equation:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10 because there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify this by calculating the number of brownies:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure.
2. Apply the 20% discount for getting both services.
3. Add the cost of nail art to the discounted total.

First, let's calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure:
- Basic manicure: $35
- Basic pedicure: $40

Next, we add these costs together:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]
\[ \text{Discounted total} = 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total (2 hands, 5 fingers each), and each nail art costs $3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of:

"Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation to solve for \( K \):

\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we will calculate the price step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November:**
   The toy's price in November is $40.

2. **Price in December:**
   The price increased by 80% in December. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase in December} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price in January:**
   The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease in January} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Thus, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to consider the standard rate and the reduced rate for veteran lessons.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 lessons at the standard rate:
- Standard rate per lesson: $80
- Number of standard rate lessons: 4
- Total earnings from standard rate lessons: \( 4 \times 80 = 320 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the 2 lessons with veterans:
- Reduced rate per lesson (25% off the standard rate): \( 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \) dollars
- Number of veteran lessons: 2
- Total earnings from veteran lessons: \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) dollars

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

This means Eve has 5 pomelos left. 

To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. 

The final numerical answer is 15."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them:

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"If Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the following equation to find the number of novels she has written this year:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she has written this year, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of novels this year:

\[ \text{novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{novels this year} = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year."
"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, he travels:

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 50 \times 24 \times 3 \, \text{km} \]

\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = 0.6 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is 60%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice. Therefore, he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\).
4. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\).
5. The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother. This is \(36 + 48 = 84\).

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84."
"To find the number of teachers at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

Number of teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Let's calculate this:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9 = 79 + 9 = 88

So, the final numerical answer is 88."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we first need to calculate the weekly cost of the ingredients.

1. **Cost of pasta**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cost of cheddar cheese**: $3.00.
3. **Cost of gruyere cheese**: twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, we add up the weekly costs:
- Cost of pasta + cost of cheddar cheese + cost of gruyere cheese = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so the weekly cost is $10.00. To find the yearly cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
- Yearly cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{520}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours to match the workday format. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out how many days it will take to complete the cleaning, we divide the total hours required by the hours worked per day:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 8 \text{ hours/day} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the cleaning, they will have 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, which is within the given timeframe.

Now, to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning per day and then find the percentage of that time relative to the 8-hour workday.

Since the total cleaning time is 20 hours over 2.5 days, the time spent cleaning per day is:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \div 2.5 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning per day}}{\text{Total hours in a workday}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours/day}} \right) \times 100 = 100\% \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 100% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"Let's break down the capacity of each shelf:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves: \(10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we can determine how many bookcases she needs by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

- \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final numerical answer is:

2"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the total earnings from selling 60 eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \]

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red Hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats**: After removing the red hats, we have:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats remaining}
   \]

4. **Blue Hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **White Hats**: The rest of the hats are white. We subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky bag after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. Therefore, the price Archie will pay is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sticks of beef jerky are in the bag. Since the bag contains 30 sticks, we can calculate the cost per stick by dividing the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick is $0.50, which is equivalent to 50 cents. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate how many questions she answered correctly on the first test.

The first test has 70 questions, and Audrey got 60% of them correct. Therefore, the number of questions she got right on the first test is:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions across both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to correctly answer 70% of 110 questions to pass:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) is 20, we can find the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara has played in four years.
2. Multiply the number of games by her average score per game.

First, Ara has been playing 40 games every year. Over four years, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, her score for every game is 21 points. Therefore, the total number of points she has scored in the four years is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"Brendan initially had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he dropped 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he got rid of 1 bead, so he ended up with 3 - 1 = 2 marbles. Therefore, Brendan ended up with 2 marbles."
"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into the steps based on the given averages.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 / 2 = 7.5 customers. Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to 8 customers (as he needs to meet or exceed the 15 car target).

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, Jason needs 8 * 25 = 200 telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final numerical answer is 200."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna and her family.

First, let's determine the number of flashlights:
- There are 4 people in the house, so there are 4 flashlights for them.
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and 2 flashlights are provided for each room, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is 4 (for the people) + 16 (for the rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's determine the number of candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so the total number of small candles is 4 * 4 = 16.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so the total number of medium candles is 4 * 5 = 20.
- Therefore, the total number of candles is 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

Now, we add the total number of flashlights and candles:
- Total number of flashlights and candles = 20 (flashlights) + 36 (candles) = 56.

The final numerical answer is 56."

If Dominick also saw half as many helmets as footballs, then there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 20 helmets + 10 robots + 40 footballs = 70 items. 

The final numerical answer is 70."
"First, we need to determine how many hours Tim works in a week. Since he works 5 days a week and each day he works 6 hours, we calculate:

\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to convert the total hours he works in a week into minutes, since the time it takes to deal with a call is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we know that it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a week, we divide the total minutes he works in a week by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the drying time for both scenarios and then find the difference.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry. Therefore, for 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:
\[ 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry. Therefore, for 6 paintings, the total drying time would be:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in drying time between the new varnish and the old varnish for 6 paintings is:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry as compared to the old varnish."
"To calculate the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the amount of water each group of plants needs.

First, we calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups} \]

Then, we calculate the water needed for the remaining plants. Since Crista has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have already been accounted for, the remaining number of plants is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ plants} \]
Each of these 8 plants needs a quarter of a cup of water:
\[ 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel half the distance on land and the other half in water.

First, we determine the total distance Phineas needs to travel, which is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the distance for each part as follows:

- Distance on land: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards
- Distance in water: \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to travel each part of the distance.

- Time to hop on land: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to swim in water:
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the time for both parts of the journey to find the total time it takes for Phineas to return home:

\[
\text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"To determine the cost for Bob to buy the popsicle sticks, we first need to calculate how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs. Since each box contains 8 sticks and he needs 56 sticks, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks. Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Therefore, the cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs \( 2x \). We are given that the main phone costs $20, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. There are five phones in total, with one being the main phone and the other four being additional phones. The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 + 4 \times 10 = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:

"To calculate the total cost Alicia spends on dry-cleaning her clothes over 5 weeks, we need to first calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by 5.

For the blouses:
5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00

For the pants:
2 pairs of pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00

For the skirt:
1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Now, we add these amounts to find the weekly cost:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Finally, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
$47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \text{ words}}{375 \text{ WPM}} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the number of people Conor saw on the first day:
\[ \text{First day} = 50 \]

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day:
\[ \text{Second day} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day:
\[ \text{Third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Let's denote the number of people Conor saw on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days as \( x \). According to the problem, the average number of people Conor saw each day over the week was 60. Therefore, the total number of people seen over the week can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total number of people} = 50 + 70 + 140 + x + x + x = 260 + 3x \]

Since the average number of people seen each day over the week is 60, the total number of people seen over the week can also be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total number of people} = 60 \times 7 = 420 \]

Now we can set up the equation:
\[ 260 + 3x = 420 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 420 - 260 \]
\[ 3x = 160 \]
\[ x = \frac{160}{3} \approx 53.33 \]

However, since the number of people must be a whole number, we can conclude that the value of \( x \) is indeed 53.33, but for the purpose of the total number of people seen, we use the exact value in the equation.

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ 260 + 3 \times 53.33 = 260 + 160 = 420 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples the previous rate, so \(60 \times 4 = 240\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(240 \div 2 = 120\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440\]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat. The number of kernels that pop due to residual heat is:
\[120 \div 4 = 30\]

So, the total number of kernels that pop is:
\[440 + 30 = 470\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[470\]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade.

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon. Therefore, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups} \text{ of lemon juice} \]

Additionally, Tim's best friend Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means Tim needs an extra 1 cup of lemon juice for the extra gallon.

So, the total amount of lemon juice required is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 5 cups of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we need to find out how many lemons are needed for 5 cups.

If 6 lemons yield 1 cup, then:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need:
\[ \boxed{30} \text{ lemons} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we first need to find out how much food the dogs consume per day and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

For the German Shepherds:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg per German Shepherd per day = 15 kg per day

For the Bulldogs:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg per Bulldog per day = 6 kg per day

Total daily consumption:
15 kg (from German Shepherds) + 6 kg (from Bulldogs) = 21 kg per day

Total weekly consumption:
21 kg per day * 7 days = 147 kg

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we first need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2.

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

Given:
- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

The total number of blocks can be expressed as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \( R \):
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled west and the distance he traveled east, and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles.

Now, we find the net distance from his starting point:
- The net distance is the difference between the distance traveled east and the distance traveled west.
- Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after first year = Original value - Depreciation = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciated by 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after second year = Value after first year - Depreciation = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat depreciated by 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after third year = Value after second year - Depreciation = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the number of orange and yellow candies, and then subtract these from the total number of candies.

Given:
- Total candies = 232
- Red candies = 54
- Orange candies = 2 * Red candies = 2 * 54 = 108
- Yellow candies = 1/2 * Red candies = 1/2 * 54 = 27

Now, we can calculate the number of pink candies by subtracting the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies.

Number of pink candies = Total candies - (Red candies + Orange candies + Yellow candies)
Number of pink candies = 232 - (54 + 108 + 27)
Number of pink candies = 232 - 189
Number of pink candies = 43

The final numerical answer is 43."
"To calculate the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and the cost of one night was $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

Therefore, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them in the playground. Initially, Dallas has 21 marbles. After dropping 4 marbles, he has:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \text{ marbles} \]

Since Mazie originally had 52 marbles and Dallas ends up with 17 marbles after receiving some from Mazie and losing 4, the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie is:

\[ 17 + 4 = 21 \text{ marbles} \]

This means that Dallas received 21 marbles from Mazie. Since the total number of marbles Mazie had initially was 52, and Dallas received 21 marbles, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \text{ marbles} \]

Therefore, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

The cost of the adult tickets is:
2 adults * $12/adult = $24

The cost of the child ticket is:
1 child * $8/child = $8

The cost of the popcorns is:
2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$24 (adult tickets) + $8 (child ticket) + $6 (popcorns) = $38

So, the total amount they pay is $38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents. The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds. John also has two children, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds. Adding these together, the total weight is:

\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. Therefore, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

\[0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs over a week.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Dexter has five pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds per pig per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over a week (7 days), the total feed consumption is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:

Money left:
Total revenue - Total cost = $80 - $20 = $60

So, the final numerical answer is $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: There are 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. Therefore, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the end of the third street, there are 30 children following the truck. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group, but this does not affect the number of children following the truck, as they have already left the group.

Thus, the final number of children following the truck is 30."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has planned to distribute.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's calculate the total:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out a total of 142 meals.

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals planned:
Total meals planned: 1,360
Meals given out: 142

Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142

Let's calculate this:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218."
"To calculate the total amount of money James has, we need to convert each type of coin to cents and then sum them up.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.

James has:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 2 nickels = 2 * 5 = 10 cents
- 7 dimes = 7 * 10 = 70 cents

25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents

So, the total amount of money James has is 105 cents."
"To find the total age of all the siblings, we need to add up the ages of the 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

Given:
- The age of each sister is 16.
- There are 3 sisters, so the total age of the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\).
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.
- There are 2 brothers, so the total age of the brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\).

Adding the total ages of the brothers and sisters together, we get:
\[48 + 36 = 84\]

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks, we need to break down the time spent each day and then multiply by the number of days in 4 weeks.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation each day:
- Meditation in the morning: 15 minutes
- Meditation before sleep: 15 minutes
- Total meditation time per day: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga each day:
- Yoga practice: 1 hour (60 minutes)

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga each day:
- Total daily practice time: 30 (meditation) + 60 (yoga) = 90 minutes

Since Charisma practices 5 days a week, we calculate the weekly practice time:
- Weekly practice time: 90 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 450 minutes/week

Finally, we calculate the total practice time over 4 weeks:
- Total practice time over 4 weeks: 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
- Total practice time over 4 weeks in hours: 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each type of t-shirt and then sum them up.

For the small t-shirts:
11 small t-shirts * 3 square feet per small t-shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium t-shirts:
8 medium t-shirts * 4 square feet per medium t-shirt = 32 square feet

For the large t-shirts:
6 large t-shirts * 6 square feet per large t-shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage from each type of t-shirt:

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a large sunflower. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the original 36 seeds gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from each:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many pens Sarah has, we first need to determine how many pens Timothy has. Given that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:

\[ \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 27 \]"
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice as tall as Albert, Anne's height is:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer to reach her current height of 70 inches. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3"" growth from her current height:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie's height before the summer was:

\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To determine the total revenue the company will receive for selling chocolate bars over two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars.

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to consider the discounts on the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys two T-shirts and the store offers a buy one get one 50% off deal, the first T-shirt is at full price and the second T-shirt is at half price.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. The discount amount is $40 * 0.40 = $16. Therefore, the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together, we get $12 + $24 = $36.

Thus, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance for the 3 weeks he completed his chores:

\[ \text{Ryan's allowance} = 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so a total of 4 ice cream cones:

\[ \text{Cost of ice cream cones} = 4 \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ \text{Money left} = 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:

\[ \text{Number of movie tickets} = \left\lfloor \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 each = 10 * $50 = $500

Profit = Revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

"To calculate Josh's earnings in 2 weeks, we need to determine how many days he works in a week and then calculate his earnings based on the number of cars he services and his daily pay.

Josh is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he works 5 days a week. 

He services 3 cars a day, and he gets paid $4 per car. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$12/\text{day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in the number of holes over time and then determine how long it takes to fill them all.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:
- The dog digs 6 holes per day.
- Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
- Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate returns, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, but Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day at night. The net change in the number of holes per day is:
- Net change per day = 6 holes dug - 9 holes filled = -3 holes.

This means that every day, the number of holes decreases by 3. We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes.

Let \( d \) be the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes. The total number of holes filled in \( d \) days is:
\[ 9d \]

We set this equal to the total number of holes dug:
\[ 9d = 84 \]
\[ d = \frac{84}{9} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.33 \]

Since \( d \) must be a whole number of days, we round up to the next whole number, which is 10 days. This means it takes 10 days to fill in all the holes.

To find out how many weeks it takes, we divide the number of days by 7:
\[ \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.43 \]

Since we are asked for the number of weeks, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2 weeks.

Therefore, the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is:

"To find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we first need to determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

Now, to find how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1000 \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies made - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)

Let's calculate:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 5670
Chocolate chip cookies = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know the quantities Dr. Grumpus requested:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14

Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: Half as many as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Petri dishes: Two more than the number requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
- Beakers: The correct number, which is 7

The total number of items Igor had initially was:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + 7 \text{ (beakers)} = 31 \]

However, Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. This means he lost:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is 2."
"To solve this, we first need to calculate the total number of screws required for all the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is assembling 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"If there are 10 eggs in the first basket, and there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, then the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs. 

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

"First, let's determine how much money each person raised individually.

Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we add up the total amount raised by all of them:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 \]

Let's calculate the sum:
\[ 430 + 750 = 1180 \]
\[ 1180 + 300 = 1480 \]
\[ 1480 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ \boxed{2180} \]"
"Let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Time Aaron took}}{\text{Aaron's speed}} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{A} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( A = 2V \), we can substitute \( A \) in the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{16}{2V} = \frac{8}{V} \]

According to the problem, the distance Aaron ran is half the distance Vanessa ran. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{8}{V} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = 4 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles. Since her speed is \( V = 4 \) miles per minute, the time she took to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{\text{Vanessa's speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per minute}} = 1 \text{ minute} \]

So, Vanessa took 1 minute to complete her part of the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock. Given that he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total revenue per night and then multiply by the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine per night:
- Cost of 2 meals: 2 * $5 = $10
- Cost of 1 bottle of wine: $5
- Total cost per night: $10 + $5 = $15

Now, we know that the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, and they make $15 in profit per night. So, the total revenue per night is $15.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total revenue for the week is:
- Revenue per night * Number of nights open in a week = $15 * 2 = $30

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $30."
"First, let's calculate the total selling price of the watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on the cost price of $80.

The profit amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Cost Price} \times \text{Profit Percentage} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine James's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 9 years old.
   - James is now twice as old as Dora, so James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

2. **Determine the age of John when James was born:**
   - John had James when he was 19, so John was 19 years old when James was born.

3. **Determine the age of John when James is 18:**
   - Since James is 18 years old now, John is \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old now.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we first need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange. In one hour (60 minutes), she can peel:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. In one hour (60 minutes), she can peel:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price of radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of installation} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of the installation to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 230 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. Let's confirm this by checking the total number of legs:
- 5 chickens have \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs.
- 15 cows have \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.
- The total number of legs is \( 10 + 60 = 70 \), which matches the given information.

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, we need to determine the total number of slices available from the 7 pizzas. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 14 \]"
